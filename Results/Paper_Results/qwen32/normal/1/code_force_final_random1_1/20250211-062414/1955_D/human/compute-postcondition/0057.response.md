Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` was greater than 0, then `ans` is 2 if `curr - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, and `curr` is the total number of valid matches between elements in `a` and `b_values` after considering the counts in `cnt_b` minus 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` was not greater than 0, then `ans` remains 2 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, and `curr` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, `ans` and `curr` remain unchanged. `n` is greater than `m`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` was in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` was greater than 0.**
