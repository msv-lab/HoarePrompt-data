The given code snippet sets the value of `cnt_b[i]` to 0. This affects only the variable `cnt_b` by changing its value at index `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing at least one unique element, `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop, `curr` is the final count of valid matches between the last window of `a` (from `a[n-m]` to `a[n-1]`) and `b_values`, `cnt_b` reflects the final counts of elements from `b` after processing all windows of `a` except `cnt_b[i]` which is now 0, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `i` is the next unique element from `b_values`**.

In simpler terms, the count of the element `i` in `cnt_b` is reset to 0, while all other variables retain their previous values.
