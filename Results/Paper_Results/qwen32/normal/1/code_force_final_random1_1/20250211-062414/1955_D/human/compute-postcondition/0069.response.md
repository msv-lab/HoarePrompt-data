The code snippet provided decrements the count of `a[i + m]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. This means that the value associated with the key `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is reduced by 1.

Given the initial conditions:
- `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`.
- `n` is greater than `m`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` was greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1.

After executing the line `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1`, the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1. No other variables are explicitly modified by this line.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `n` is greater than `m`; `i` is `i + 1`; `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1.**
