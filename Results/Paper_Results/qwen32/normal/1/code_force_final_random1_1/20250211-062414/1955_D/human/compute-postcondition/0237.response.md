The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `ans` could be either 1, 2, or 3. After incrementing, `ans` will be either 2, 3, or 4 respectively.

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`. `ans` is either 2, 3, or 4 depending on its initial value. `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `b_values` remain unchanged. `i` is `x + 1`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1.**
