The given code snippet only modifies the variable `curr` by incrementing it by 1. Since `curr` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it was defined somewhere before this snippet and holds some integer value. After executing `curr += 1`, its value increases by 1.

The other variables (`b_values`, `ans`, `m`, `i`, and `cnt_b[a[2]]`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `m` is greater than 0; `i` is 2; `cnt_b[a[2]]` is decreased by 1; `curr` is increased by 1.**
