The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. Given the initial state, the values of `b_values`, `ans`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the value associated with `a[i]` in the `cnt_b` dictionary.

Output State: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `m` is greater than 0; `i` is 1; the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1.**
