Postcondition: **`b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `ans` is 0; `m` is greater than 0; `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `curr` is 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `curr` remains 0, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, `curr` remains 0.**
