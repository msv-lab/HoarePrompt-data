The provided code snippet only assigns a constant value to the variable `max_val`. It does not affect any other variables or perform any operations that would change the initial state of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, or `b`.

Therefore, the only change is that `max_val` is now assigned the value `1000000`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; a is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; b is a list of m integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; max_val is 1000000.**
