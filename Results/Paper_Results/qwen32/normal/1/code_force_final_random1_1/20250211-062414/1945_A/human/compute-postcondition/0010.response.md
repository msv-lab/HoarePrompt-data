Output State: **`t` is at least 1, and the input contains `t` lines, each with three integers `a`, `b`, `c` such that `0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9`; `s` is the next line in the input; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers obtained by splitting and converting `s`. `b` is now equal to `b + c`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `b` has been updated to be the sum of its original value and the value of `c`. All other variables remain unchanged.
