The only object in the loop head is the variable `s`. The loop iterates over all lines in the input except the first one (which presumably contains the value of `t`). Each iteration processes one line of input.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is at least 1, and the input contains `t` lines, each with three integers `a`, `b`, `c` such that 0 ≤ a, b, `c` ≤ 10^9; `a` is unchanged, `b` is `b + c`, `c` is unchanged. The loop variable `s` represents the current line being processed.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what `s` should be. Since `s` takes each line from the input starting from the second line, at the start of the next iteration, `s` should be the next line in the input.

State: **`t` is at least 1, and the input contains `t` lines, each with three integers `a`, `b`, `c` such that 0 ≤ a, b, `c` ≤ 10^9; `a` is unchanged, `b` is `b + c`, `c` is unchanged. `s` is the next line in the input.**

Since we don't have specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c` for the next line, we just describe `s` as "the next line in the input."
