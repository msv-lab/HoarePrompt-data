Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the conditions provided and prints either `a + (b + c) // 3` or `-1` depending on whether `c` is less than `(b + c) % 3`.**
