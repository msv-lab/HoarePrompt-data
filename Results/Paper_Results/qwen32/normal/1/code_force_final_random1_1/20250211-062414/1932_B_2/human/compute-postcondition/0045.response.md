The only variable in the loop head is `test`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If there are more test cases in the list, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `test` is the second test case in `test_cases`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least a third test case in `test_cases`. The `test` variable will then be updated to this third test case.

State: **`test_cases` contains at least three test cases, `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21, `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases`, `current_year` is 21**
