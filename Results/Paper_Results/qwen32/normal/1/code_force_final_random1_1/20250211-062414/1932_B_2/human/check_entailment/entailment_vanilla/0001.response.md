Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads another integer `n` representing the number of signs.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers `a` where each integer `a_i` represents the periodicity of the i-th sign.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - It iterates over each sign's periodicity `ai` in the list `a`.
     - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign will be in `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, the next occurrence will be in the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
     - The `current_year` is updated to this next occurrence year.
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the final `current_year` is appended to the results list.

3. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the results for each test case.

### Verification Against the Problem Description

- **Sequential Occurrence:** The program correctly calculates the year of each subsequent sign's occurrence based on the previous one, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
- **Multiples Calculation:** The logic for finding the next occurrence of a sign as a multiple of its periodicity is accurate.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles cases where the periodicity is 1 (signs occur every year), and where multiple signs share the same periodicity.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement. It accurately calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs sequentially according to its periodicity.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
