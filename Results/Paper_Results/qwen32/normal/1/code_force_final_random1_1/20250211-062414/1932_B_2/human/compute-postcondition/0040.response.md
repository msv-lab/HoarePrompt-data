To determine the new state after executing the given Python code, let's analyze the variables and their relationships:

1. `test_cases` contains at least two test cases.
2. `results` is a list containing one element, 0.
3. `test` is the second test case in `test_cases`.
4. `n` is the integer from the second test case in `test_cases`.
5. `a` is the list of integers from the second test case in `test_cases`.
6. `ai` is the third element in `a`.
7. `current_year` is calculated based on the condition `10 % ai == 0`. If true, `current_year` is `10 + ai`; otherwise, `current_year` is `(10 // ai + 1) * ai`.

The code snippet calculates `next_year` using the formula `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

Let's denote the value of `ai` as `x` for simplicity.

- If `10 % x == 0`, then `current_year = 10 + x`.
- Otherwise, `current_year = (10 // x + 1) * x`.

Given these conditions, `next_year` is calculated as follows:

- If `10 % x == 0`, then `next_year = ((10 + x) // x + 1) * x = (10 // x + 1 + 1) * x = (10 // x + 2) * x`.
- Otherwise, `next_year = ((10 // x + 1) * x // x + 1) * x = (10 // x + 1 + 1) * x = (10 // x + 2) * x`.

Thus, regardless of the condition, `next_year` is always `(10 // x + 2) * x`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least two test cases, `results` is a list containing one element, 0, `test` is the second test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the integer from the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the list of integers from the second test case in `test_cases`, `ai` is the third element in `a`, `current_year` is calculated as `10 + ai` if `10 % ai == 0` else `(10 // ai + 1) * ai`, `next_year` is `(10 // ai + 2) * ai`.**
