Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for test in test_cases:
    n, a = test
    current_year = 0
    for ai in a:
        if current_year % ai == 0:
            next_year = current_year + ai
        else:
            next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
        current_year = next_year
    results.append(current_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` contains at least one test case where the first test case includes an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6); `results` is a list containing one element, `current_year`; `n` is the integer from the first test case; `a` is the list of integers from the first test case; `current_year` is the final value calculated after processing all elements in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` contains at least two test cases, `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21, `test` is the second test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the integer from the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the list of integers from the second test case in `test_cases`, `current_year` is 21.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `current_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list `a`; `results` includes `current_year` as its last element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
