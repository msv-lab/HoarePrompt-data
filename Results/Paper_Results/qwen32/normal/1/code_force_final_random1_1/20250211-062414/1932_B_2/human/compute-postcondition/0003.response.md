The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
