### Reasoning:

The given Python program aims to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the rules specified in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic of the program and see if it correctly implements the required functionality.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, representing the number of signs.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers `a`, where each integer `a_i` represents the periodicity of the i-th sign.

2. **Computing the Year:**
   - The variable `year` is initialized to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, the program updates `year` using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.
     - This expression works as follows:
       - `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`.
       - If `year % ai` is non-zero, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, and the next occurrence of the sign will be at the next multiple of `ai`. The smallest such multiple greater than `year` is `year + (ai - year % ai)`, which simplifies to `year + ai - year % ai` or `year + ai - (year % ai)`, but since we're adding `year % ai` to `year` if it's non-zero, it effectively skips to the next multiple of `ai`.
       - If `year % ai` is zero, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so the next occurrence of the sign will be exactly at `year + ai`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all the signs for a test case, the program prints the final value of `year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **First Test Case:**
  - `n = 6`
  - `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - Initial `year = 0`
  - Iteration 1: `year = 0 + 3 = 3` (first sign)
  - Iteration 2: `year = 3 + 1 = 4` (second sign, since 3 % 2 != 0, add 1 to reach 4)
  - Iteration 3: `year = 4 + 4 = 8` (third sign, since 4 % 4 == 0, add 4 to reach 8)
  - Iteration 4: `year = 8 + 2 = 10` (fourth sign, since 8 % 5 != 0, add 2 to reach 10)
  - Iteration 5: `year = 10 + 8 = 18` (fifth sign, since 10 % 9 != 0, add 8 to reach 18)
  - Iteration 6: `year = 18 + 18 = 36` (sixth sign, since 18 % 18 == 0, add 18 to reach 36)
  - Output: `36`

This matches the expected output for the first test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly computes the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the given periodicities and the sequential requirement of the signs. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
