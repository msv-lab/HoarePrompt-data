Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to find the year when the n-th sign occurs, considering that each sign must occur sequentially.
- The i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years.
- After the i-th sign occurs, we start waiting for the (i+1)-th sign from the next year.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case:
1. It reads the number of signs `n`.
2. It reads the list of periodicities `a` for these signs.
3. It initializes `year` to 0.
4. For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, it updates the `year` as follows:
   - `year += year % ai or ai`
     - This expression ensures that we move to the next occurrence of the sign.
     - `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`. If this remainder is non-zero, it means the next occurrence of the sign is `ai - (year % ai)` years later.
     - If `year % ai` is zero, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, and the next occurrence is exactly `ai` years later.
     - The expression `year % ai or ai` effectively computes the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `year + 1`.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the first example provided in the problem statement:

#### Example Input:
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```

#### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. Initialize `year` to 0.
2. First sign (`ai = 3`):
   - `year += 0 % 3 or 3` → `year = 3`
3. Second sign (`ai = 2`):
   - `year += 3 % 2 or 2` → `year = 3 + 1 = 4`
4. Third sign (`ai = 4`):
   - `year += 4 % 4 or 4` → `year = 4 + 4 = 8`
5. Fourth sign (`ai = 5`):
   - `year += 8 % 5 or 5` → `year = 8 + 3 = 11`
6. Fifth sign (`ai = 9`):
   - `year += 11 % 9 or 9` → `year = 11 + 7 = 18`
7. Sixth sign (`ai = 18`):
   - `year += 18 % 18 or 18` → `year = 18 + 18 = 36`

The final year for the sixth sign is indeed 36, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year when the n-th sign occurs, considering the sequential nature of the signs. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
