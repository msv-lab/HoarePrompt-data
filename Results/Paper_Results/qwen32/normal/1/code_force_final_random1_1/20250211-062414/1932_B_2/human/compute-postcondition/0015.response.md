The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts those components to integers, and stores them in the list `a`. This operation does not affect the variables `year`, `t`, or `n`.

Output State: **`year` is the result of sequentially applying the update rule `year += year % ai or ai` for each `ai` in the list `a`; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
