The only variable in the loop head is `ai`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state and how it evolves as the loop progresses.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `year` is `a[0]`.
- `t` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element.

Since `ai` iterates over each element in the list `a`, at the start of the next iteration, `ai` should be the next element in the list after `a[0]`.

Therefore, if `a` has more than one element, `ai` should be `a[1]` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`year` is `a[0]`, `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is `a[1]`**
