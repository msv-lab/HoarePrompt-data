Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state:

Initial State:
- `test_cases` contains at least three test cases.
- `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21.
- `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`.
- `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`.
- `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least one element.
- `current_year` is 0.
- `current_year % ai == 0` where `ai` is an element of the list `a`.

Code Snippet:
```python
next_year = current_year + ai
```

Impact of the Code:
- `next_year` is calculated as `current_year + ai`.
- Since `current_year` is 0, `next_year` will be equal to `ai`.

Output State:
- `test_cases` contains at least three test cases.
- `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21.
- `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`.
- `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`.
- `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least one element.
- `current_year` is 0.
- `current_year % ai == 0` where `ai` is an element of the list `a`.
- `next_year` is equal to `ai`.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least three test cases; `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21; `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`; `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least one element; `current_year` is 0; `current_year % ai == 0` where `ai` is an element of the list `a`; `next_year` is equal to `ai`.**
