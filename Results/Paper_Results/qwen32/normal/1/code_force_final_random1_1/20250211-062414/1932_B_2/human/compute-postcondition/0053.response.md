Postcondition: **`test_cases` contains at least three test cases; `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21; `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`; `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least one element; `current_year` is 0; `next_year` is set to the first element `ai` in the list `a` that satisfies `current_year % ai == 0`. If no such element exists, `next_year` is set to the first element `ai` in the list `a`.**
