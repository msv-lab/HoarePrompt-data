You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        score = 0
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        print(score)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It sorts the list and calculates the sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2). It then prints this sum for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To solve this problem optimally, we need to maximize the sum of the minimum values chosen from pairs of numbers over `n` iterations. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Sorting the List**: By sorting the list of numbers, we ensure that the smallest numbers are paired together. This is because when we sort the list, the smallest number at an even index `i` will always be less than or equal to the smallest number at index `i+1`, which means that `l[i]` will be the minimum value when pairing `l[i]` and `l[i+1]`.

2. **Summing the Minimums**: After sorting, we simply sum up the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2). These elements represent the minimum values of each pair when the list is divided into pairs of consecutive elements.

3. **Iterating Over Test Cases**: The outer loop handles multiple test cases, reading the number of test cases first, and then processing each test case individually.

Let's break down the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1**: For the input `2 3`, the sorted list is `[2, 3]`. The score is `2` because we take the minimum of the only pair `(2, 3)`, which is `2`.
  
- **Test Case 2**: For the input `1 1 2 1`, the sorted list is `[1, 1, 1, 2]`. We take the minimum of the pairs `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which are both `1`. Thus, the score is `1 + 1 = 2`.
  
- **Test Case 3**: For the input `1 1 1 1 1 1`, the sorted list is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. We take the minimum of the pairs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(1, 1)`, which are all `1`. Thus, the score is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

The provided code correctly implements this logic by sorting the list and summing the elements at even indices.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum final score by sorting the list and summing the minimum values of the pairs formed.
