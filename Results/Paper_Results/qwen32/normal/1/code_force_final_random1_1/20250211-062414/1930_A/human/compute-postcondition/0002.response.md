The code reads an input string, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, creates a list of these integers, sorts the list in ascending order, and assigns the sorted list to the variable `l`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input.**
