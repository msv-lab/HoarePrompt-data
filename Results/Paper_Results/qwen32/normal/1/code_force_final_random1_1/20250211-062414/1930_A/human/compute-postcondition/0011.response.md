To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input.
4. `score` is the sum of elements at even indices from 0 to 2*(n-1) in the list `l`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(score)
```

### Analysis:
- `t` is mentioned but it is not used in the calculation of `score` or in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- `n` determines the number of pairs of elements in the list `l` that contribute to the `score`.
- `l` is a sorted list of integers.
- `score` is calculated by summing up the elements at even indices from 0 to 2*(n-1) in the list `l`.

### Calculation of `score`:
- Since `l` is a sorted list, the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2*(n-1)) are the smallest elements among the pairs considered.
- `score` is the sum of these elements.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be the sum of the elements at even indices from 0 to 2*(n-1) in the sorted list `l`.

Output: **score (where score is the sum of elements at even indices from 0 to 2*(n-1) in the sorted list `l`)**
