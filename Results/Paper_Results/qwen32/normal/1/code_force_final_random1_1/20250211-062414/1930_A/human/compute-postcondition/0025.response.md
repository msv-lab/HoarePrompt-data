The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to whatever integer is provided as input. The other variables (`t`, `l`, and `score`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `score` is the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to `2 * n - 2` in the list `l`.**
