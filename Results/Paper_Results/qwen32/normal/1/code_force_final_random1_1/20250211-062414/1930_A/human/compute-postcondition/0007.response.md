The code snippet `score += l[i]` adds the value of `l[i]` to the current value of `score`. Since `i` is incremented by 2 before this line, `score` was initially set to `l[i]` (where `i` had its previous value), and now it will be updated to `l[i] + l[i]`, which is `2 * l[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is incremented by 2, `score` is `2 * l[i]`**.
