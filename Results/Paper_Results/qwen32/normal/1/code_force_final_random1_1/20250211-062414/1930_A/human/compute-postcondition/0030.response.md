The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```
This loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration, starting from 0 and ending before `2 * n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input
- `score` is `l[i]`

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 2 from its current value.
- `n` remains unchanged as it defines the range of the loop.

Let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 2`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is `i + 2`, `score` is `l[i + 2]`**

However, since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state in terms of the next expected value of `i`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is the next even number after the previous `i`, `score` is `l[i]` where `i` is the next even number after the previous `i`** 

For clarity, if we denote the previous `i` as `i_prev`, then the new `i` would be `i_prev + 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is `i + 2`, `score` is `l[i + 2]`**

Given that we don't have the exact previous `i`, we can generalize:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is the next even number, `score` is `l[i]` where `i` is the next even number**
