The code snippet `score += l[i]` adds the element at index `i` of the list `l` to the variable `score`. Given the initial state, `score` was initially 0. After executing the code, `score` will be updated to the value of `l[i]`.

Since `l` is a sorted list of integers and `i` is an index within the bounds of `l`, the exact value of `score` will depend on the value of `l[i]`. However, the conditions on `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is `l[i]`.**
