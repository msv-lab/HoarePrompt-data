### Reasoning:
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the score by performing the given operation exactly `n` times. Each operation involves selecting two integers from the list, adding the smaller one to the score, and removing both integers from the list. 

The key insight here is to always pair the smallest available numbers together. This strategy ensures that we are maximizing the contribution of the smaller numbers to the score, which is crucial because we are adding the minimum of the two selected numbers to the score.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Sorting the List**: By sorting the list of integers, we ensure that the smallest numbers are at the beginning of the list.
2. **Pairing the Smallest Numbers**: We iterate through the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first (i.e., indices 0, 2, 4, ...). These elements represent the smallest numbers in each pair, which we add to the score.
3. **Summing the Scores**: By summing these smallest numbers, we achieve the maximum possible score.

Let's verify this with the provided examples:

- **First Test Case**: Input is `2 3`. After sorting, we have `[2, 3]`. The score is `2` (since `min(2, 3) = 2`).
- **Second Test Case**: Input is `1 1 2 1`. After sorting, we have `[1, 1, 1, 2]`. The score is `1 + 1 = 2` (since `min(1, 1) = 1` and `min(1, 2) = 1`).
- **Third Test Case**: Input is `1 1 1 1 1 1`. After sorting, we have `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. The score is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (since `min(1, 1) = 1` three times).

The provided program correctly implements this strategy by sorting the list and summing every second element starting from the first.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the maximum final score by following the optimal strategy of pairing the smallest numbers together.

**Correctness: True**
