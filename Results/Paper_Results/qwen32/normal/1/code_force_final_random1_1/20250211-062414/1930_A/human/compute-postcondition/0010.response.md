To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to understand how the loop operates and how it modifies the `score` variable.

The loop iterates over the list `l` with a step of 2, starting from index 0, and adds the elements at these indices to the `score`. The loop runs `n` times because the range is defined as `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`, which means it will iterate `n` times (since `2 * n / 2 = n`).

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final `score` will be the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element (index 0).

Here's the detailed breakdown:
- The loop starts with `i = 0` and adds `l[0]` to `score`.
- In the next iteration, `i = 2` and `l[2]` is added to `score`.
- This continues until `i = 2 * (n - 1)`.

Thus, the final `score` will be the sum of the elements at indices `0, 2, 4, ..., 2 * (n - 1)` in the list `l`.

Since `t` and `l` do not change during the loop, and `n` defines the number of iterations, the final state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is the sum of elements at even indices from 0 to 2*(n-1) in the list `l`.**

In simpler terms, the final `score` is the sum of every second element in the sorted list `l`, starting from the first element.
