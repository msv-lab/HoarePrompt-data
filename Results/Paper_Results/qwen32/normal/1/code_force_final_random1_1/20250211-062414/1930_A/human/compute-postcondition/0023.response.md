To determine the output of the `print(score)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant computations:

1. **Variable `t`**: This is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 5001\). However, `t` does not directly influence the calculation of `score` in this context, so we can ignore it for the purpose of determining the output.

2. **Variable `n`**: This is an input integer. The value of `n` determines how many elements are considered in the calculation of `score`.

3. **List `l`**: This is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input. The sorting order of `l` is important because it affects which elements are summed to compute `score`.

4. **Variable `score`**: This is the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to \(2 \cdot n - 2\) in the list `l`. These indices correspond to the even indices in the first \(2 \cdot n\) elements of the list `l`.

Given these details, the `score` is computed by summing every second element starting from the first element in the sorted list `l` up to the \(n\)-th such element.

### Example Calculation
Let's illustrate with an example:
- Suppose `n = 3` and `l = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]` (a sorted list).
- The elements at indices 0, 2, and 4 are 1, 5, and 9, respectively.
- Therefore, `score = 1 + 5 + 9 = 15`.

### General Case
In the general case, if `l` is a sorted list and `n` is the number of elements to consider, then `score` is the sum of the elements at even indices up to the \(n\)-th such element.

### Conclusion
The output of the `print(score)` statement will be the sum of the elements at even indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to \(2 \cdot n - 2\) in the sorted list `l`.

Output: **score (where score is the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to \(2 \cdot n - 2\) in the sorted list `l`)**
