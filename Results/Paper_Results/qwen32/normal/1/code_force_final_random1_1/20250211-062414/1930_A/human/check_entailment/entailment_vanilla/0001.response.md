### Reasoning:

To solve this problem optimally, we need to maximize the sum of the minimum values chosen from pairs of numbers over `n` iterations. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Sorting the List**: By sorting the list of numbers, we ensure that the smallest numbers are paired together. This is because when we sort the list, the smallest number at an even index `i` will always be less than or equal to the smallest number at index `i+1`, which means that `l[i]` will be the minimum value when pairing `l[i]` and `l[i+1]`.

2. **Summing the Minimums**: After sorting, we simply sum up the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2). These elements represent the minimum values of each pair when the list is divided into pairs of consecutive elements.

3. **Iterating Over Test Cases**: The outer loop handles multiple test cases, reading the number of test cases first, and then processing each test case individually.

Let's break down the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1**: For the input `2 3`, the sorted list is `[2, 3]`. The score is `2` because we take the minimum of the only pair `(2, 3)`, which is `2`.
  
- **Test Case 2**: For the input `1 1 2 1`, the sorted list is `[1, 1, 1, 2]`. We take the minimum of the pairs `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which are both `1`. Thus, the score is `1 + 1 = 2`.
  
- **Test Case 3**: For the input `1 1 1 1 1 1`, the sorted list is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. We take the minimum of the pairs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(1, 1)`, which are all `1`. Thus, the score is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

The provided code correctly implements this logic by sorting the list and summing the elements at even indices.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum final score by sorting the list and summing the minimum values of the pairs formed.

Correctness: **True**
