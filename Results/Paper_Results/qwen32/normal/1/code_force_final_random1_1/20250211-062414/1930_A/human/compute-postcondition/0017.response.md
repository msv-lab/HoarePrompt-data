The code snippet `score += l[i]` adds the element at index `i` of the list `l` to the variable `score`. Given the initial state, `score` was 0, and after this operation, `score` will be equal to the value of `l[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `score` is `l[i]`**.
