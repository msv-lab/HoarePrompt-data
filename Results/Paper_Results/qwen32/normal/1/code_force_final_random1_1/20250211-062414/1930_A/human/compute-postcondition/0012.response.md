The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times based on the input. The loop will execute as many times as the integer provided by `input()`. Since `_` does not affect the loop's continuation or any other variable within the loop, we only need to ensure that the loop counter (which is implicitly managed by the `range` function) is adjusted correctly.

Given that the loop iterates `int(input())` times, and assuming that `t` represents the current iteration count starting from 1, we need to increment `t` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is the sum of elements at even indices from 0 to 2*(n-1) in the list `l`.** 

Note: The value of `t` is incremented by 1, and the range for `t` is adjusted accordingly. However, since the original constraint was 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, after the first iteration, the new constraint becomes 2 ≤ t ≤ 5001, and this pattern continues until the loop completes.
