Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters; `x`, `k` is 1, `n`; `sorted_indices`, `pos` is `len(sorted_indices) - 1`; `distance` is incremented by 1; `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0; `rest` is 0; `delta` is 0.**

Natural Language: The variable `pos` has been incremented by 1, making its new value `len(sorted_indices) - 1`. All other variables retain their previous values.
