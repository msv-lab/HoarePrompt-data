The code snippet `rest -= delta` modifies the value of `rest` by subtracting the value of `delta`. Given that `delta` is either 0 or 1, `rest` will either remain unchanged (if `delta` is 0) or decrease by 1 (if `delta` is 1).

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters; `x` is 1, `k` is `n`; `sorted_indices`, `pos` is `len(sorted_indices) - 2` or `len(sorted_indices) - 1` depending on the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`; `distance` is incremented by 1; `rest` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `delta`; `delta` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `rest` is now either 0 or 1, depending on whether `delta` was 1 or 0, respectively. All other variables retain their previous values.
