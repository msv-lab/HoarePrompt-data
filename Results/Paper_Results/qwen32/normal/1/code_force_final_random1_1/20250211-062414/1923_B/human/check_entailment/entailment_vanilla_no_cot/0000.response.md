To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic and implementation of `func_1` and how it handles the problem requirements.

### Analysis of `func_1`:

1. **Sorting by Distance:**
   - The function sorts the indices of the monsters based on their absolute distance from the character (point 0).
   - This is done using `sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))`.
   
2. **Processing Monsters:**
   - It initializes `distance` to 0, which represents the current time step.
   - It iterates through the sorted indices (`pos` variable) and processes monsters that are at the current `distance` from the character.
   
3. **Checking Distance:**
   - If a monster is at the current `distance` (i.e., `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`), the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the character cannot survive because the monster will reach the character at this time step.
   
4. **Firing Bullets:**
   - For each monster at the current `distance`, the function calculates the number of bullets needed to kill the monster (`delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`).
   - It subtracts the fired bullets from the remaining bullets (`rest -= delta`) and reduces the monster's health (`a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta`).
   - If the monster's health reaches 0, it increments `pos` to move to the next monster.
   
5. **Incrementing Time Step:**
   - After processing all monsters at the current `distance`, the function increments `distance` to move to the next time step.
   
6. **Completion:**
   - If the function processes all monsters without any reaching the character, it returns `True`.

### Issues in the Implementation:

- **Incorrect Distance Check:**
  - The condition `if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:` checks whether the monster is at the current distance, but it doesn't account for the fact that monsters move towards the character every second. This means that even if a monster is not at the current distance initially, it could move to that distance in subsequent seconds.
  
- **Logic for Monster Movement:**
  - The code does not correctly simulate the movement of monsters towards the character. Instead, it only checks the initial distance of monsters and assumes that they do not move unless explicitly processed.
  
- **Handling Multiple Monsters at Same Distance:**
  - The code does not handle multiple monsters that might move to the same distance in the same time step correctly. It should ensure that no monster reaches the character at any point in time, not just when it is initially at a certain distance.

### Conclusion:

Given these issues, the implementation of `func_1` is incorrect as it does not accurately simulate the movement of monsters and the firing of bullets over time.
