Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters after all possible shots have been fired, with `a[sorted_indices[0]]` reduced by `delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` (which is `a[sorted_indices[0]]` initially) is 0, then `pos` is set to 1; otherwise, `pos` remains 0. `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices` remain unchanged; `distance` is incremented by 1; `rest` is `k - delta`; `delta` is now `min(k - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**

In simple terms, the new value of `delta` is determined by taking the minimum between the remaining shots (`k - delta`) and the health of the current target monster (`a[sorted_indices[pos]]`). All other variables retain their previous values.
