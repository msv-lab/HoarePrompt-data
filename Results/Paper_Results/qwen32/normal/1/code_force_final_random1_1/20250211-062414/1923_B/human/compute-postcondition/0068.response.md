The given code snippet modifies the value of `rest` by subtracting `delta` from it. Let's determine the new state of `rest` and ensure all other variables remain as specified.

Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters.
- `a[sorted_indices[0]]` is reduced by `delta`.
- If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` (initially `a[sorted_indices[0]]`) is 0, then `pos` is set to 1; otherwise, `pos` remains 0.
- `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices` remain unchanged.
- `distance` is incremented by 1.
- `rest` is `k - delta`.
- `delta` is `min(k - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.

Code Execution:
- `rest -= delta` modifies `rest` by subtracting the current value of `delta` from it.

New Value Calculation:
- `rest` was initially `k - delta`.
- After executing `rest -= delta`, the new value of `rest` becomes `(k - delta) - delta`, which simplifies to `k - 2*delta`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters, `a[sorted_indices[0]]` is reduced by `delta`, `pos` is 1 if `a[sorted_indices[0]]` is 0, otherwise `pos` remains 0, `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices` remain unchanged, `distance` is incremented by 1, `rest` is `k - 2*delta`, `delta` is `min(k - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**
