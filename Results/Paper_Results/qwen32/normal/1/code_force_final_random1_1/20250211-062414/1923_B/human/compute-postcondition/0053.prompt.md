Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters after all possible shots have been fired; `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, `pos` remain unchanged; `pos` is one less than `len(sorted_indices)`; `distance` is incremented by 1. If the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to `distance`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return and continues execution; `rest` is equal to `k`.
Code of the loop:
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
    rest -= delta
    a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
    if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
        pos += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters; `x`, `k` is 1, `n`; `sorted_indices`, `pos` is either `len(sorted_indices) - 1` or `len(sorted_indices) - 2`; `distance` is incremented by 1; If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, then `sorted_indices[pos]` is updated to `len(sorted_indices) - 1`. Otherwise, `sorted_indices[pos]` remains `len(sorted_indices) - 2`. `rest` is 0; `delta` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters where `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`. `x` is 1. `k` is `n`. `sorted_indices`, `pos` is `len(sorted_indices) - 1` or `len(sorted_indices)` depending on the initial value of `pos`. `distance` is incremented by 1. `rest` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `delta`. `delta` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was initially 0, the value of `pos` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`; `x` is 1; `k` is `n`; `sorted_indices` and `pos` are such that `pos` is `len(sorted_indices) - 1` unless `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, in which case `pos` is `len(sorted_indices)`. `distance` is incremented by 1; `rest` is 1 - `delta`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
