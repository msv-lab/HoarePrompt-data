You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, x, k):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))
    distance = 0
    pos = 0
    while pos != len(sorted_indices):
        if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
            return False
        rest = k
        while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
            delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
            rest -= delta
            a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
            if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
                pos += 1
        distance += 1
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of monsters, their health values, their positions, and the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to defeat all monsters under the given constraints and prints 'YES' if possible, otherwise 'NO'.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to determine whether we can kill all monsters before any of them reach position 0. We have `n` monsters, each with a specific health (`a_i`) and position (`x_i`). Every second, we can shoot up to `k` bullets at the monsters, reducing their health by 1 per bullet. After shooting, any monster with health 0 or less dies, and the remaining monsters move one unit closer to position 0. If any monster reaches position 0, we lose.

### Key Points to Consider

1. **Order of Shooting**: We need to decide which monsters to shoot at each second. An optimal strategy would be to shoot at the monsters that are closest to position 0 first to prevent them from reaching us.
2. **Health Management**: We need to keep track of the health of each monster and ensure that we can reduce their health to 0 before they reach position 0.
3. **Distance Tracking**: We need to track the distance of each monster from position 0 and ensure that no monster reaches 0 before we can kill it.

### Program Analysis

The provided program uses a function `func_1` to determine if it's possible to kill all monsters before they reach position 0. Here's how the function works:

1. **Sorting**: The function sorts the indices of the monsters based on their absolute distance from position 0 (`abs(x[i])`).
2. **Simulation Loop**: It simulates each second of the game:
   - Checks if any monster has reached position 0 (`if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`).
   - Shoots up to `k` bullets at the monsters, prioritizing those closest to position 0.
   - Reduces the health of the targeted monsters and removes them if their health reaches 0.
   - Increases the distance counter to simulate the movement of the monsters.
3. **Termination**: The loop continues until all monsters are either killed or one reaches position 0.

### Issues in the Program

There are several issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Distance Check**: The condition `if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance` checks if the current monster's distance is equal to the distance counter, but it doesn't account for the fact that the distance counter represents the number of seconds passed, not the actual distance of the monsters. This check is flawed because the distance of the monsters changes every second, and the condition doesn't correctly reflect when a monster reaches position 0.
   
2. **Monster Movement**: The program does not update the positions of the monsters after each second. The positions should be updated to reflect the movement of the monsters towards position 0.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic for shooting bullets and updating the health of the monsters is correct, but the overall simulation loop and distance check are flawed.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly simulate the scenario as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
