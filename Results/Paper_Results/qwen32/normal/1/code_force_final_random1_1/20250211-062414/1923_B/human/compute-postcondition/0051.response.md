The code increments the value of `pos` by 1. Given the initial state, `pos` was initially set to `len(sorted_indices) - 1`. After the increment, `pos` will be `len(sorted_indices)`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`; `x` is 1; `k` is `n`; `sorted_indices`, `pos` is `len(sorted_indices)`; `distance` is incremented by 1; `rest` is 1 - `delta`.**
