Output State: **`a`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `t` are the last set of values read from the input, with `t` being 0. The loop has finished executing all its iterations.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variables `a` and `x` will hold the values from the last iteration's input, `n` and `k` will be the integers from the last iteration's input, and `t` will be 0, indicating that no more iterations are left to execute.
