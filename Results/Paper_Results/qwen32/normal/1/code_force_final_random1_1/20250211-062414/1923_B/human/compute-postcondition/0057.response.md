Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters after all possible shots have been fired; `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices` remain unchanged; `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`; `distance` is incremented by 1; `rest` is 0. If the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to `distance`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return and continues execution.**
