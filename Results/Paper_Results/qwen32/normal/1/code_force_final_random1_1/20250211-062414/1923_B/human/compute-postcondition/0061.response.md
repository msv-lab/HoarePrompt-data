Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters after all possible shots have been fired; `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices` remain unchanged; `pos` is 0; `distance` is incremented by 1; `rest` is `k - delta`; `delta` is `min(k, a[sorted_indices[0]])`.**

Explanation: The value of `rest` is decreased by `delta`, where `delta` is the minimum of `k` and the health of the monster at the position indicated by the first index in `sorted_indices`. All other variables remain unchanged.
