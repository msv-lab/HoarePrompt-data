You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `na_frente` and `pos_final`, and two lists of integers `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum possible cost to reach `pos_final` from `na_frente` by either passing through elements in `custo_pra_passar_b` or swapping to elements in `custo_pra_trocar_a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Kirill is at the end of a queue of `n` people.
- He wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
- To swap positions with someone at position `i`, Kirill pays `a_i` coins.
- Additionally, for each person between the swapped positions, Kirill pays `b_k` coins.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach one of the first `m` positions.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of:
- `n`: Number of people in the queue (excluding Kirill).
- `m`: Maximum allowable final position of Kirill.
- `a`: List of costs to swap with each person.
- `b`: List of additional costs to pass through each person.

The program iterates from the last person in the queue to the first, calculating the minimum cost to move Kirill to one of the first `m` positions.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The program seems to have a flawed logic for calculating the total cost. Specifically, the decision to add `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to the total cost does not align with the problem description. The problem requires paying `a_i` to swap with the person at position `i` and `b_k` for each person between the swapped positions, but the program does not correctly account for these costs.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `m = 1` (Kirill needs to be at the front of the queue).

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 1
7 3 6
4 3 8
```
- Kirill starts at position 4.
- He wants to be at position 1.
- The costs to swap with each person are `[7, 3, 6]`.
- The additional costs to pass through each person are `[4, 3, 8]`.

The optimal solution would be to swap with the second person (cost `3`) and then pay `4` to pass through the first person, resulting in a total cost of `7`. However, the provided program may not calculate this correctly due to its flawed logic.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly calculates the total cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions. It does not properly account for the costs associated with swapping and passing through people in the queue. This results in incorrect outputs for certain test cases.
