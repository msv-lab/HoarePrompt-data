To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop operates and how it modifies the variables based on the given conditions.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p`.
- In each iteration, it checks if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`:
  - If true, it adds `a_values[y]` to `custo`.
  - If false, it adds `b_values[y]` to `custo`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `custo` starts at 0.
- `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`.
- `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`.
- `custos` includes the current value of `custo`.
- `a_values` and `b_values` are lists of integers derived from `a` and `b` respectively.
- `nf`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

### Iteration Details:
- After the first iteration (`y = num_fila - 1`), `custo` is updated based on the comparison between `a_values[num_fila - 1]` and `b_values[num_fila - 1]`.
- After the second iteration (`y = num_fila - 2`), `custo` is further updated based on the comparison between `a_values[num_fila - 2]` and `b_values[num_fila - 2]`.
- After the third iteration (`y = num_fila - 3`), `custo` is updated based on the comparison between `a_values[num_fila - 3]` and `b_values[num_fila - 3]`.

### Final Iteration:
- The loop continues until `y` reaches `max_p`.
- At each step, `custo` accumulates the smaller of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]`.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will execute `num_fila - max_p` times.
- After all iterations, `custo` will hold the sum of the smallest values between corresponding elements of `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p`.

### Output State:
- `custo` will be the final accumulated value.
- `num_fila` and `max_p` remain unchanged.
- `custos` will include the final value of `custo`.
- `a_values` and `b_values` remain unchanged.
- `nf`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Let's assume some example values for clarity:
- Suppose `num_fila = 5` and `max_p = 2`.
- The loop will iterate for `y = 4, 3, 2`.
- `custo` will be the sum of the minimum values of `a_values[4]` and `b_values[4]`, `a_values[3]` and `b_values[3]`, and `a_values[2]` and `b_values[2]`.

### Example Calculation:
- Let's say `a_values = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` and `b_values = [15, 25, 35, 45, 60]`.
- For `y = 4`: `custo += min(50, 60) = 50`
- For `y = 3`: `custo += min(40, 45) = 40`
- For `y = 2`: `custo += min(30, 35) = 30`
- Final `custo` = 50 + 40 + 30 = 120

Thus, the final output state would be:

Output State: **custo is 120, num_fila is 5, max_p is 2, custos includes 120, a_values is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], b_values is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], nf is unchanged, a is unchanged, b is unchanged.**

In natural language: The final value of `custo` is the sum of the smallest values between corresponding elements of `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state.
