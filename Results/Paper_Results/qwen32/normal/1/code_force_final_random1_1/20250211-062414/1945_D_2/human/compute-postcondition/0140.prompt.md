Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input minus 1, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is 0, `best` is 10^12.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input minus 1 (must be non-negative), `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is -1. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is set to `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; otherwise, `total` is set to `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`. Additionally, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if this value is less than the initial value of `best` (which is 10^12). If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is set to `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; otherwise, `total` is set to `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input minus 1 (must be non-negative), `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is 0. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]`. Additionally, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` if `best` was previously greater than this value. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[0] < custo_pra_passar_b[0]`; otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input minus 1 (must be non-negative), `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is 0. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is incremented by `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`. Otherwise, `total` is incremented by `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`. Additionally, if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`, `total` is set to `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`. Otherwise, `total` is set to the original value of `total` plus `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
