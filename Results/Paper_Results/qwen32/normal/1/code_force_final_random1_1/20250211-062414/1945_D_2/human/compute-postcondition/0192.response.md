Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

- `custo` is initially set based on the conditions provided. Since `y` is 0, we need to check the condition: `sum of a_values[y - 1] and b_values[y] is less than or equal to a_values[y]`.
- `a_values[y - 1]` would be `a_values[-1]`, which is not defined in the list. However, since `y` is 0, the condition cannot be evaluated as intended due to the out-of-bounds access. We'll assume the condition is not met because of this issue, making `custo` equal to 130.
- `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `custos` includes 120, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged, and `y` is 0.
- The code snippet `custo += b_values[y]` increments `custo` by the value of `b_values[0]`, which is 15.

Therefore, `custo` changes from 130 to 145.

Output State: **`custo` is 145, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `custos` includes 120, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged, and `y` is 0.**
