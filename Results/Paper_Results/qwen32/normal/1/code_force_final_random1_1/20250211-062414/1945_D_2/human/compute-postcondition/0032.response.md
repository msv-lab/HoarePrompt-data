Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer such that `na_frente` ≥ 0, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `total` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and the value at index `v` in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
