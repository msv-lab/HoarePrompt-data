The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns these integers to the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. This means that the list `custo_pra_trocar_a` is updated with the new values read from the input, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is the accumulated minimum cost from `na_frente` to 0, `best` is the minimum cost encountered when switching up to `pos_final`**.

In simpler terms, the list `custo_pra_trocar_a` now contains the integers read from the input, while all other variables retain their original values.
