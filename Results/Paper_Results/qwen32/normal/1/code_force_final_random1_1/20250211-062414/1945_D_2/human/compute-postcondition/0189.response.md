Output State: **`custo` is 130, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `custos` includes 120, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `y` is 1, and the sum of `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
