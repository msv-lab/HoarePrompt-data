The code snippet `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments the `total` variable by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. Given the initial state, `v` is -1, so the value added to `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`.

Therefore, the updated `total` will be `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`, which simplifies to `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input minus 1 (and is non-negative), `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`, and `best` is either 10^12 or `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` was initially greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
