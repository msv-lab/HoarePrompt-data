The only variable in the loop head is `c`, and the iterable is `custos`. For the loop to execute, `custos` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `custos`.

Given the current state where `custos = [120, 140]`, the loop will indeed execute as `custos` already contains elements. However, if we were to adjust the state to ensure the loop executes, we would confirm that `custos` has at least one element.

Therefore, no adjustment is strictly necessary since the loop will execute with the given state. But to adhere to the requirement of specifying the state explicitly:

State: **`custos` is a list with at least one element, currently `custos = [120, 140]`**
