The code snippet decrements the value of `pos_final` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input minus 1, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input.**
