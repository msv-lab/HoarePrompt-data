The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `custo_pra_trocar_a`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, or `pos_final`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input.**
