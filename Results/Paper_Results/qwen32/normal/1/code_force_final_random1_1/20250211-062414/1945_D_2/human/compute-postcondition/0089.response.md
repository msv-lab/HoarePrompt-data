Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is unchanged unless previously `best` was less than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, in which case `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The values of `t`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged. The variable `best` is updated only if its current value is less than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
