Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `custos` includes the current value of `custo`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings from the latest input, `b` is a list of substrings from the input.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
    if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
        custo += a_values[y]
    else:
        custo += b_values[y]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `custo` is updated to either `custo + a_values[y]` if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, or `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y] >= b_values[y]`. `num_fila` remains an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` remains unchanged, `custos` includes the current value of `custo`, `a_values` and `b_values` remain lists containing the integer values of all elements in `a` and `b` respectively, `nf` remains a list of substrings from the input where the first element is an integer greater than or equal to the integer value of the second element, `a` remains a list of substrings from the latest input, and `b` remains a list of substrings from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `y` is decremented by 1, `num_fila` remains unchanged, `max_p` remains unchanged. If `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, then `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is updated to `custo + b_values[y]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `y` is `max_p + 1`, `num_fila` remains unchanged, `max_p` remains unchanged, and `custo` is increased by either `a_values[max_p + 1]` if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, or by `b_values[max_p + 1]` otherwise.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
