To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables. The loop iterates over each element `y` in the list `b` and appends its integer value to the list `b_values`. 

Given the initial state and the described behavior of the loop, the final state will be reached once every element in `b` has been processed. Therefore, `b_values` will contain the integer values of all elements in `b`.

Let's summarize the final state:

- `custo` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `num_fila` remains the integer value of the first element in `nf`.
- `max_p` remains the integer value of the second element in `nf`.
- `custos` includes the current value of `custo` (which is 0).
- `a_values` remains a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`.
- `b_values` will contain the integer values of all elements in `b` after the loop completes.
- `nf`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Output State: **`custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `custos` includes the current value of `custo`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings from the latest input, `b` is a list of substrings from the input.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `b_values` will have converted all elements of `b` into integers and stored them in a list, while all other variables retain their initial values or remain unchanged.
