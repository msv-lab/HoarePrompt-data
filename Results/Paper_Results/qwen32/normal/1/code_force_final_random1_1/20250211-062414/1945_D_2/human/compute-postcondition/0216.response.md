To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the provided information about the loop's behavior and the changes in the `custos` list.

Initially, `custos` is `[120, 140]`. The loop iterates over each element in `custos` and prints it. After the first two iterations, the loop has printed `120` and `140`. The third iteration indicates that `custos` now contains three elements, specifically `[120, 140, 160]`, and the current value of `c` is `160`.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `custos`, and after three iterations, `custos` has three elements, the loop will execute exactly three times (once for each element in the list). Therefore, the loop will not execute any further iterations because there are no more elements in `custos` to iterate over.

Thus, the final output state is simply the state after the third iteration, where `custos` is `[120, 140, 160]` and the loop has completed its execution.

Output State: **`custos` is `[120, 140, 160]` and the loop has completed its execution.**
