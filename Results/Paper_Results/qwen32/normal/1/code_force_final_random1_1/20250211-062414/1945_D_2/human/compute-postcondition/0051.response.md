The given code snippet reads a new list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `custo_pra_passar_b`. This means that the previous value of `custo_pra_passar_b` is replaced with the newly read list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `na_frente` to `0`, `best` is the minimum cost encountered up to `pos_final`.**
