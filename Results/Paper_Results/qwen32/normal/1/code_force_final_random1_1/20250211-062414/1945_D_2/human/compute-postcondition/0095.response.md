The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which is the loop control variable. According to the loop statement, `c` iterates over the range of `cases`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `c` by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `cases` is greater than or equal to 1
- `c` is 1
- `na_frente` is the first integer read from input minus 1
- `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 2
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input
- `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input
- `v` is -1
- `total` is the accumulated minimum cost from `na_frente` to 0
- `best` is the minimum cost encountered when switching up to `pos_final`

Since only `c` can be adjusted, we increment `c` by 1 to prepare for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input minus 1, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is the accumulated minimum cost from `na_frente` to 0, `best` is the minimum cost encountered when switching up to `pos_final`**
