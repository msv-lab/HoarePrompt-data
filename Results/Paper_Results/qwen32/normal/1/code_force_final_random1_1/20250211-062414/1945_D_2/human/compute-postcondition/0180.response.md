To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `y`, `max_p`, and the range function parameters.

Given the for loop:
```python
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range function generates at least one value. The range function `range(start, stop, step)` generates values starting from `start` down to `stop + step` (not inclusive) with the given `step`.

In this case:
- `start` is `max_p - 1`
- `stop` is `0`
- `step` is `-1`

For the loop to execute, `start` must be greater than or equal to `stop` (since the step is negative). Therefore, `max_p - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`, which implies `max_p` must be greater than `0`.

Since `max_p` is already given as `2`, the condition is satisfied. However, we should ensure that `y` is initialized to `max_p - 1` before the loop starts.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `max_p` is greater than `0` and `y` is set to `max_p - 1` before the loop starts.

State: **`custo` is 120, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2 (must be greater than 0), `custos` includes 120, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `y` is 1**
