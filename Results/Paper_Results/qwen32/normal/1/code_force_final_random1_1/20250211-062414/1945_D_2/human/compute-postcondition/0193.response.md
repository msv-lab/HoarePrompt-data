The value of `custo` is incremented by the first element of `a_values`, which is 10. Therefore, `custo` becomes 145 + 10 = 155. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`custo` is 155, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `custos` includes 120, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged, and `y` is 0.**
