Postcondition: **`custo` is 155 if `y` is 1, otherwise `custo` remains 145. `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `custos` includes 120, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, and the sum of `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`. Specifically, `a_values[0] + b_values[1]` (which is 10 + 25) is less than or equal to `a_values[1]` (which is 20). If `y` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
