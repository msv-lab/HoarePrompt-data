The only variable in the loop head is `c`, and it iterates over the elements of the list `custos`. At the end of the previous iteration, `c` was 140, which is the second (and last) element in the list `custos = [120, 140]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, there should be another element in the list `custos` after 140. However, since `custos` currently has only two elements, the loop cannot execute again.

But if we assume the task is to describe the state as if there were another element in the list, then:

- The list `custos` would need to have at least three elements.
- The variable `c` would take the value of the next element in the list.

Given this assumption, let's say the next element in `custos` is `160`. Then the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`custos` is a list with at least three elements, currently `custos = [120, 140, 160]`, `c` is 160**
