The code snippet `b = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `b`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables listed in the initial state.

Therefore, the updated state includes the new variable `b` which holds the list of substrings from the input.

Output State: **`custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `i` is incremented by 1, `custos` includes the current value of `custo`, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings from the latest input, `b` is a list of substrings from the input.**
