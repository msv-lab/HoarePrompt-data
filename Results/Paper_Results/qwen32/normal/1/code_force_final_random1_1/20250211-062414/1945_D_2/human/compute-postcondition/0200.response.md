The code snippet increments the value of `custo` by the value of `b_values[y]`. Given that `y` is 1, `b_values[1]` is 25. Therefore, `custo` is incremented by 25.

Initially, `custo` is 145 because `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` (which translates to `10 + 25 <= 20`, which is false) and `y == 1` (which is true). However, since the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is false, `custo` is actually 110 according to the given conditions.

After the increment, `custo` becomes `110 + 25`, which is 135.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`custo` is 135, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `custos` includes 120, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged, and `y` is 1.**
