The value of `custo` is incremented by `b_values[y]`. Given that `y` is `max_p + 1`, the value added to `custo` is `b_values[max_p + 1]`. The values of `num_fila`, `max_p`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y` is `max_p + 1`, `num_fila` remains unchanged, `max_p` remains unchanged, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p + 1]`**.
