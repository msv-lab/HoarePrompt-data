The value of `idx` is incremented by 2. Initially, `idx` was 2, so after the increment, `idx` becomes 4. The other variables (`data`, `t`, `results`, `n`, and `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (the first element in `data`), `idx` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[3]`.**
