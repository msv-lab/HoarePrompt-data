Output State: **`data`, `t`, `idx` is increased by 2, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `v1`, `it1`, `it2`, `_` is incremented by 1, `l` is `int(data[idx])`, `r` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` has `'YES'` appended to it.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their previous values and states.
