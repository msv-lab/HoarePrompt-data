Output State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `idx` is `n + 6`; `results` is a list containing the string `'YES'` if `x` equals 0, otherwise `results` contains the string `'NO'`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `q` is an integer value greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 3])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique prefix XOR value and the value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key; `l` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[n + 5]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. Additionally, either `it1` is not less than the length of `v1`, or `it2` is less than 0, or `v1[it1]` is greater than `r`, or `v2[it2]` is less than `l`.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the string `'NO'` is appended to the `results` list. All other variables retain their initial values.
