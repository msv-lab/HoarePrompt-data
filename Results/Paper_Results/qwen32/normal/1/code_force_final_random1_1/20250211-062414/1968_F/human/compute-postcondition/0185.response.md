Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line, `n` is at least 1, `q` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer value greater than 0, `idx` is calculated as `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2 * q + 2 + 2`, `results` is a list containing `q + q + 2` elements, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[2]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[2]` which is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs. If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[2]]` is now an empty list. `i` is 2.**
