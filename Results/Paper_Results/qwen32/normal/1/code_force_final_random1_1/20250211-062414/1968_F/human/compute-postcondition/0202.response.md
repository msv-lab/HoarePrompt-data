The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or the state of the program outside of the loop. Since there is no loop explicitly mentioned in the context, the `continue` statement here seems out of place and does not change any of the given variables.

Thus, the state of the program remains unchanged after executing the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`data` remains the same, `t` remains the same, `idx` is `3 * n + 4 * q + 8`, `results` now contains `'YES'`, `n` remains the same, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` has its first `n` elements filled with integers from `data` starting from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx - 1]`, `pf` has its first `n` elements filled with the cumulative XOR values of the corresponding elements in `a`, `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and `x` is equal to 0.**
