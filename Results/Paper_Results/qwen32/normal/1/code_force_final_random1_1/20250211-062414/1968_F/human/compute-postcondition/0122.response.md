Output State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line such that `data[idx - 3 - n]` is a positive integer, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `idx` is `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2`, `results` is a list containing `q + 2` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, the next element being `''`, and the last element being `'YES'`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2 - n]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3 - n]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first `n` elements are integers from `data` starting at the position `idx - n - 2` up to `idx - 3`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element from index `1` to `n` contains the prefix XOR value, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and `x` is equal to 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their original values as described in the initial state.
