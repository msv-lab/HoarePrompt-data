The code snippet increments the value of `idx` by 2. This change affects only the `idx` variable, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Given the initial state:
- `data` is a list of strings split from the input line.
- `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 2`).
- `idx` is `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2 * q`.
- `results` is a list containing `q + q + 2` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, the next `q` elements being `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the conditions inside the loop, and the last two elements being `''`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`.
- `q` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]` and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first `n` elements are integers from `data` starting at the position `idx - n - 2 - 2 * q` up to `idx - 3 - 2 * q`.
- `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element from index `1` to `n` contains the prefix XOR value.
- `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs.

After executing `idx += 2`, the new value of `idx` is `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2 * q + 2`.
