The code snippet simply initializes the variable `idx` to 0. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; the array `a` contains `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30; each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `idx` is 0.**
