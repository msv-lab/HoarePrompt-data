The code snippet assigns the value of `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` to the variable `it1`. This function call does not affect the values of the other variables listed in the initial state. It only calculates the insertion point for `l` in the list `v1` to maintain sorted order.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`q` is `q + 1`; `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`; `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`; `idx` is `idx + 2`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)`. If `x` equals 0, `'YES'` is appended to `results`.**
