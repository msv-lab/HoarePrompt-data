The given code snippet assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to `a[i]`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we assume `i` is a valid index for the list `a`.

Given:
- `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q + 2`.
- `data` is a list of strings split from the input line.

After executing `a[i] = int(data[idx])`, the list `a` will have its `i`-th element updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`. All other elements of `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q + 2`, `results` is a list containing `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]` and must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is `{0: [0]}`.**
