The code snippet assigns a new value to `it2` based on the `bisect.bisect_left` function applied to `v2` and `r`. Specifically, `it2` is set to `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.

Given the initial state, the values of `v2`, `r`, and `it2` are updated as follows:
- `v2` remains `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`.
- `r` remains `int(data[idx - 1])`.
- `it2` is now `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.

All other variables (`q`, `l`, `idx`, `x`, `v1`, `it1`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is `q + 1`; `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`; `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`; `idx` is `idx + 2`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)`; `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `x` equals 0, `'YES'` is appended to `results`.**
