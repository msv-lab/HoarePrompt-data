Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a` containing `n` integers, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` indicating a subarray of `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive). The function returns the sum of the elements in the specified subarray for each query.**
