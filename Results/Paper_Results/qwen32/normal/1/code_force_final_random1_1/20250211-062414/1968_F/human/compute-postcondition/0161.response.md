Output State: **`q` is `q + 1`; `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`; `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`; `idx` is `idx + 2`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)`; `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`; `'NO'` is appended to `results`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value `'NO'` is appended to the list `results`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
