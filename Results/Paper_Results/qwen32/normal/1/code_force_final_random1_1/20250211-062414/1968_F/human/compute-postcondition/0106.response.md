The given code appends the current value of `i` to the list associated with the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`. 

Given the initial state, `mp[pf[i]]` is initially an empty list `[]` if `pf[i]` was not previously in `mp`. After executing the line `mp[pf[i]].append(i)`, the list associated with `pf[i]` in `mp` will contain the value of `i`.

Therefore, the updated state of `mp` will reflect this change.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q + 4`, `results` is a list containing `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]` and must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
