The code snippet assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to the variable `l`. Given that `idx` is `n + 4`, the value of `l` will be the integer representation of the element at position `n + 4` in the list `data`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `idx` is `n + 4`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `q` is an integer value greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 3])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique prefix XOR value and the value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key; `l` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`.**
