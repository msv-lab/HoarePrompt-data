The code snippet `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list stored at the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`.

Given the initial state, `mp[pf[i]]` is already initialized as an empty list if `pf[i]` is not in `mp`. After executing the code, `mp[pf[i]]` will contain the value of `i` as its only element if `pf[i]` was not previously in `mp`, or it will have the existing elements plus the new value of `i` if `pf[i]` was already in `mp`.

The values of `data`, `t`, `idx`, `results`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, and `i` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q + 5`, `results` is a list containing `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 5]` and must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the value `i` appended to its list.**
