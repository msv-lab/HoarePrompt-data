The code snippet provided is `results.append('')`. This means a new empty string `''` is appended to the `results` list.

Given the initial state, `results` is a list containing `q + q + 1` elements, with the last element being `''`. After appending another `''`, the `results` list will now contain `q + q + 2` elements, with the last two elements both being `''`.

Therefore, the updated state of `results` is that it now has an additional empty string appended to it. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `idx` is `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2 * q`, `results` is a list containing `q + q + 2` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, the next `q` elements being `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the conditions inside the loop, and the last two elements being `''`. `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2 - n]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3 - n]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first `n` elements are integers from `data` starting at the position `idx - n - 2 - 2 * q` up to `idx - 3 - 2 * q`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element from index `1` to `n` contains the prefix XOR value, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs.**
