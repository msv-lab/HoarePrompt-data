The given code snippet assigns a new value to `v2` by fetching the value from the dictionary `mp` using the key `pf[l - 1]`. This operation does not affect any of the previously mentioned variables except for `v2`.

Given the initial state, the values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`, and `v1` remain unchanged. The only change is that `v2` is now assigned the value obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`.

Output State: **`q` is `q + 1`; `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`; `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`; `idx` is `idx + 2`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`. If `x` equals 0, `'YES'` is appended to `results`.**
