The code snippet assigns the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])` to the variable `v1`. This means `v1` will hold the value associated with the key `pf[r]` in the dictionary `mp`, or an empty list `[]` if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`.

Given the initial state, the values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, and `x` remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `v1`, which is derived from the dictionary `mp` using the key `pf[r]`.

Output State: **`q` is `q + 1`; `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`; `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`; `idx` is `idx + 2`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`. If `x` equals 0, `'YES'` is appended to `results`.**
