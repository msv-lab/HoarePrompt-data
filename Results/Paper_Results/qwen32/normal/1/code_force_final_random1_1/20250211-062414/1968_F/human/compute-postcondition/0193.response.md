The code appends the current value of `i` (which is 3) to the list associated with the key `pf[3]` in the dictionary `mp`. Since `pf[3]` was not initially in `mp`, it would have been added with an empty list as its value. After appending `i` to this list, `mp[pf[3]]` now contains `[3]`.

Here is the updated state of the variables:

- `data` remains a list of strings split from the input line.
- `n` remains at least 1.
- `q` remains greater than 0.
- `t` remains an integer value greater than 0.
- `idx` remains calculated as `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2 * q + 2 + 2 + 1`.
- `results` remains a list containing `q + q + 2` elements.
- `a` remains a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[2]` which is `int(data[idx - 2])` and `a[3]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`.
- `pf` remains a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[2]` which is `pf[1] ^ a[2]` and `pf[3]` which is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`.
- `mp` is updated such that `mp[pf[2]]` is `[2]` and `mp[pf[3]]` is `[3]`.
- `i` remains 3.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line, `n` is at least 1, `q` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer value greater than 0, `idx` is calculated as `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2 * q + 2 + 2 + 1`, `results` is a list containing `q + q + 2` elements, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[2]` which is `int(data[idx - 2])` and `a[3]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[2]` which is `pf[1] ^ a[2]` and `pf[3]` which is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, `mp` is a dictionary where `mp[pf[2]]` is `[2]` and `mp[pf[3]]` is `[3]`, `i` is 3.**
