The code snippet `v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])` retrieves the list of indices from the dictionary `mp` where the key is `pf[r]`. If `pf[r]` does not exist in `mp`, it assigns an empty list `[]` to `v1`.

Given the initial state, the variables `data`, `t`, `idx`, `results`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `l`, `r`, and `x` remain unchanged except for the introduction of `v1`.

Output State: **`data` remains the same, `t` remains the same, `idx` is `3 * n + 4 * q + 8`, `results` contains `'YES'` if `x` is equal to 0, otherwise `results` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` has its first `n` elements filled with integers from `data` starting from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx - 1]`, `pf` has its first `n` elements filled with the cumulative XOR values of the corresponding elements in `a`, `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`.**
