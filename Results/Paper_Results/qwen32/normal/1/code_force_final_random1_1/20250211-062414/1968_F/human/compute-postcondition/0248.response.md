Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines whether there exists a subarray within the specified range whose XOR is zero. It outputs 'YES' if such a subarray exists and 'NO' otherwise, followed by an empty line after processing each test case.**
