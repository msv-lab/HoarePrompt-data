Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `idx` is `n + 4 + 2 * q + 3`, `results` is a list containing `q + 1` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element being `''`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`. If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp` is updated to include `pf[i]: []`. Otherwise, `mp` remains unchanged.**
