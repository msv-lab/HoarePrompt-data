Output State: **`data` remains the same, `t` remains the same, `idx` is `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2 * q + 2 + n + 2 * q`, `results` contains `'YES'` or `'NO'` for each iteration based on the conditions specified plus an additional empty string `''`, `n` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `a` has its first `n` elements filled with integers from `data` starting from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx - 1]`, `pf` has its first `n` elements filled with the cumulative XOR values of the corresponding elements in `a`, `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs.**

In simpler terms: The `results` list now includes an additional empty string `''` at the end. All other variables remain unchanged.
