The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations left in the loop. The loop will execute as long as `q` is greater than 0, since the loop runs `q` times.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `q` must have been decremented by 1 because one iteration of the loop has already completed. Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration, `q` should be decremented by 1 again.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `q` should be decremented by 1.

All other variables (`data`, `t`, `idx`, `results`, `n`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line such that `data[idx - 3 - n]` is a positive integer, `t` is an integer value greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `idx` is `2 * n + 4 + 2 * q + 2`, `results` is a list containing `q + 3` elements, the first `q` elements being either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, the next two elements being `''` and `'YES'` if `x` is equal to 0, otherwise the next element is `''` and the last element is `'NO'`. `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2 - n]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3 - n]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first `n` elements are integers from `data` starting at the position `idx - n - 2` up to `idx - 3`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element from index `1` to `n` contains the prefix XOR value, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, and `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`. `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`. `it1` is the position where `l` would fit in `v1` if `v1` were sorted, and `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, a new element `'YES'` has been appended to the `results` list. Otherwise, the last element of `results` is `'NO'`. `q` is now `q - 1`.**
