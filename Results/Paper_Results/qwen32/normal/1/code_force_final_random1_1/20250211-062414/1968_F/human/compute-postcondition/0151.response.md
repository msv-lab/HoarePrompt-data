The value of `idx` is incremented by 2. The values of `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`q` is `q + 1`; `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`; `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`; `idx` is `idx + 2`**.

In natural language: `q` remains `q + 1`, `l` retains its value which was `int(data[idx - 2])` before the increment, `r` retains its value which was `int(data[idx - 1])` before the increment, and `idx` is now `idx + 2`.
