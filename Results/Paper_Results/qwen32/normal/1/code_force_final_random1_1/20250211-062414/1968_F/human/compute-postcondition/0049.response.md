Output State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input line; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `idx` is `n + 6`; `results` is a list containing the string `'YES'` twice if `x` equals 0, otherwise `results` contains the string `'YES'` once; `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `q` is an integer value greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 3])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique prefix XOR value and the value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key; `l` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[n + 5]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. Additionally, `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`.**

In simpler terms, the `results` list now contains the string `'YES'` one more time compared to its initial state. All other variables retain their original values.
