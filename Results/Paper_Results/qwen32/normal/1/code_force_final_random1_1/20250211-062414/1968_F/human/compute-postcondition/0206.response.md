The given code snippet executes a binary search using `bisect.bisect_left` on the list `v1` to find the insertion point for the value `l`. This operation does not change the values of `v1`, `l`, or any other variables listed in the initial state. It only calculates the index where `l` would fit in the sorted list `v1`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the introduction of the new variable `it1`, which holds the result of the binary search.

Output State: **`data` remains the same, `t` remains the same, `idx` is `3 * n + 4 * q + 8`, `results` contains `'YES'` if `x` is equal to 0, otherwise `results` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` has its first `n` elements filled with integers from `data` starting from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx - 1]`, `pf` has its first `n` elements filled with the cumulative XOR values of the corresponding elements in `a`, `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs, `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`, `it1` is the index where `l` would fit in the sorted list `v1`**.
