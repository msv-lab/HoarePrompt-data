Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer read from the input, `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with the number 1 included and length greater than 1, `j` is incremented by 1. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
