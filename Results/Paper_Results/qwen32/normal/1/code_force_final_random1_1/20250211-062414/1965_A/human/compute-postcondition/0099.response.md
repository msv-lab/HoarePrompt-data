Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the integer read from the input.
- `l` is a map object containing integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where each \(a_i\) is an integer such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements.
- `j` is set to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `j`). The statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is the string `'Alice'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
