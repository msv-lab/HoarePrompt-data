The given code snippet updates the variable `lis` by reassigning it to a new sorted list of unique integers from the map object `l`. This operation does not affect the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `test`, `j`, `i`).

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains the integer read from the input.
- `l` remains a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `lis` is now a sorted list of unique integers from `l`.
- `test` remains True if no pair of consecutive elements in the new `lis` has a difference greater than 1 (this condition needs to be re-evaluated with the new `lis`).
- `j` remains the length of `lis` (this value needs to be recalculated with the new `lis`).
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer read from the input; `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `test` is True if no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1; `j` is the length of `lis`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
