Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer read from the input, `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least 2 elements, `test` is True, `j` is equal to the length of `lis`. The difference between the j-th element and the (j-1)-th element of `lis` is greater than 1. If `j` is odd, then `j` remains odd; otherwise, `j` remains even.**
