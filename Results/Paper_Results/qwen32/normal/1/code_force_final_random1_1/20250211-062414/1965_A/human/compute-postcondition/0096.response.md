Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer read from the input, `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements, `j` is 1. If the difference between `lis[j]` and `lis[j - 1]` is greater than 1, `test` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `test` remains True.**
