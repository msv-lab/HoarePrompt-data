To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head is defined as:

```python
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can identify that the variables `j` and `len(lis)` are relevant. Specifically, the loop will execute if `len(lis)` is greater than 1 because the `range` function generates numbers starting from 1 up to (but not including) `len(lis)`. If `len(lis)` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the integer read from the input
- `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`
- `test` is True
- `j` is the length of `lis`
- `i` is incremented by 1

We need to ensure that `len(lis)` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `lis` contains more than one unique integer.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` remains as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` remains as the integer read from the input
- `l` remains as a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `lis` must be a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements
- `test` remains True
- `j` should be set to 1 initially (since the loop starts from 1)
- `i` remains as it is, but its value is not directly relevant to the loop's execution

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer read from the input, `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements, `test` is True, `j` is 1**
