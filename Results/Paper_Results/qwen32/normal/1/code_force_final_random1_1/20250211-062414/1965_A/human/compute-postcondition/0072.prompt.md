Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer read from the input; `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `test` is True; `j` is equal to the length of `lis`. If `test` is True, the length of `lis` is either odd or even; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
        if j % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        test = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer read from the input, `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least 2 elements, `j` is equal to the length of `lis`. If the difference between the j-th element and the (j-1)-th element of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is set to False. Otherwise, `test` remains True. The parity of `j` (whether it is odd or even) does not change.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer read from the input, `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least 2 elements, `j` is `j + 1`, and the parity of `j` (whether it is odd or even) does not change. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, `test` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `test` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer read from the input, `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least 2 elements, and `j` is `j + 2`. The parity of `j` (whether it is odd or even) does not change. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, `test` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur to `test`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
