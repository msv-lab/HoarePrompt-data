To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `len(lis)`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the integer read from the input.
- `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements.
- `j` is 1.
- If the difference between `lis[j]` and `lis[j - 1]` is greater than 1, `test` is set to False and the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `test` remains True.

The loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In the previous iteration, `j` was 1. At the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 to continue the loop. The length of `lis` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop, but since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, we assume `len(lis)` stays the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `j` is now 2 (since it was incremented from 1).
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, and `test`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer read from the input, `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least two elements, `j` is 2**
