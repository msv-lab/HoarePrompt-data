Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer read from the input, `l` is a map object containing the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least 2 elements, `j` is `j + 1`, `test` is False, and the parity of `j` (whether it is odd or even) does not change.**

Explanation: The variable `test` is explicitly set to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the given conditions.
