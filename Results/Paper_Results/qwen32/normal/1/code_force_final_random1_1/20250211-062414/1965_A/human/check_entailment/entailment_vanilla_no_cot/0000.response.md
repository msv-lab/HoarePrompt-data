Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The logic used in `func_1` is flawed and does not account for the optimal moves in the game. Specifically, the game described is a variant of the Nim game, and the winning strategy involves the XOR operation on the sizes of the piles.

Here is a corrected version of the program using the XOR operation:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().rstrip())
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    xor_sum = 0
    for num in arr:
        xor_sum ^= num
    if xor_sum == 0:
        print("Bob")
    else:
        print("Alice")
```

This program calculates the XOR of all pile sizes. If the XOR sum is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the game state can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) in combinatorial game theory.
