Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `n`: An integer read from the input.
- `l`: A map object containing integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is between 1 and 1,000,000,000 inclusive.
- `lis`: A sorted list of unique integers from `l` with at least 2 elements.
- `j`: An integer that is incremented by 2 (`j = j + 2`), and its parity (odd or even) remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Alice'`. None of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, or `j` are used within this specific `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Alice'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
