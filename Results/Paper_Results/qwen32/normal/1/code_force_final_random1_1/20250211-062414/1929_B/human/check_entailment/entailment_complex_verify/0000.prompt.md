You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

    for _ in range(t):

        if 4 * n - 2 == k:

- Annotated Code: 
from math import ceil

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each pair `(n, k)`, it has printed either `k // 2 + 1` if `k == 4 * n - 2`, or `ceil(k / 2)` otherwise. The loop counter `_` is now equal to `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints a computed value: `k // 2 + 1` if `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, otherwise it prints the ceiling of `k / 2`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to color the minimum number of cells in an `n x n` grid such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- There are `4n - 2` diagonals in an `n x n` grid.
- We need to handle multiple test cases.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`. It then calculates the minimum number of cells to color based on the following logic:
- If `4 * n - 2 == k`, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.
- Otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

### Potential Issues:
Let's consider the logic and see if it covers all cases correctly.

1. **Case 1: `4 * n - 2 == k`**
   - This means we need to color cells such that all diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - The formula `k // 2 + 1` seems incorrect because it doesn't necessarily guarantee that all diagonals will be covered with this number of cells.
   - For example, if `n = 3`, then `4 * n - 2 = 10`. The formula gives `10 // 2 + 1 = 6`, but we can cover all diagonals with fewer cells.

2. **Case 2: `4 * n - 2 != k`**
   - The formula `ceil(k / 2)` seems more plausible because it suggests coloring half of the required diagonals, which is a reasonable heuristic.
   - However, it still might not be optimal for all cases.

### Testing Specific Cases:
Let's test the program with some specific cases to see if it works as expected.

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `n = 3, k = 4`
- Expected Output: `2` (as shown in the problem statement)
- Program Output: `ceil(4 / 2) = 2` (correct)

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `n = 3, k = 3`
- Expected Output: `2` (as shown in the problem statement)
- Program Output: `ceil(3 / 2) = 2` (correct)

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `n = 3, k = 10`
- Expected Output: `6` (as shown in the problem statement)
- Program Output: `10 // 2 + 1 = 6` (incorrect, should be `6` but the logic seems flawed as explained above)

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: `n = 3, k = 9`
- Expected Output: `5` (as shown in the problem statement)
- Program Output: `ceil(9 / 2) = 5` (correct)

#### Test Case 5:
- Input: `n = 4, k = 7`
- Expected Output: `4` (as shown in the problem statement)
- Program Output: `ceil(7 / 2) = 4` (correct)

#### Test Case 6:
- Input: `n = 7, k = 11`
- Expected Output: `6` (as shown in the problem statement)
- Program Output: `ceil(11 / 2) = 6` (correct)

#### Test Case 7:
- Input: `n = 2, k = 3`
- Expected Output: `2` (as shown in the problem statement)
- Program Output: `ceil(3 / 2) = 2` (correct)

### Conclusion:
While the program seems to work for some cases, it fails to provide the correct answer for all cases, particularly when `4 * n - 2 == k`. The logic used in the program is not optimal and does not guarantee the minimum number of cells for all scenarios.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when `4 * n - 2 == k`. It uses a formula that does not guarantee the minimum number of cells needed to color at least `k` diagonals.
