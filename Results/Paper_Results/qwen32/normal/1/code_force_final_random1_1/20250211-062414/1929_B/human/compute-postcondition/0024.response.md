To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `n` is the first integer from the line `s`.
- `k` is the second integer from the line `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 * n - 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`:** It is explicitly stated that `n` is the first integer from the line `s`. Therefore, the exact value of `n` depends on the content of `s`. For example, if `s` is `"3 5"`, then `n` would be `3`.
2. **Expression `2 * n - 1`:** This expression takes the value of `n`, multiplies it by 2, and then subtracts 1.

### Output Calculation:
Given that `n` is the first integer from the line `s`, the output of the print statement will be `2 * n - 1`. Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only express the output in terms of `n`.

### Final Output Description:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `2 * n - 1`, where `n` is the first integer from the line `s`.

Output: **2 * n - 1 (where n is the first integer from the line `s`)**
