Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints a specific integer based on the value of `k` relative to `n`: `math.ceil(k / 2)` if `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, `2 * n - 1` if `k` equals `4 * n - 3`, and `2 * n` if `k` equals `4 * n - 2`.**
