Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, if the conditions for `n` and `k` are met, it computes and returns a specific value or result for each test case.**
