The code snippet reads a line from the input file, splits it into two parts, converts those parts to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. Therefore, the variable `s` is no longer needed after this operation.

Given that `s` was initially the next line in the input file, and assuming `s` contained two space-separated integers, the variables `n` and `k` will now hold these integer values.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the line `s`, `k` is the second integer from the line `s`**.
