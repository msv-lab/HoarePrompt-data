To determine the output of the `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`_` is incremented by 1**: This statement doesn't affect the variables `t`, `n`, or `k` directly, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.
2. **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000**: The variable `t` represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it does not influence the current print statement.
3. **`n` and `k` are newly input integers**: These are the variables that are directly relevant to the print statement. No specific constraints on `n` are mentioned, but `k` is an integer.

### Code Analysis:
- The code snippet is `print(ceil(k / 2))`.
- `ceil(x)` is a function from the `math` module that returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x`.

### Calculation:
- The expression `k / 2` computes the division of `k` by 2.
- `ceil(k / 2)` then rounds up the result of this division to the nearest integer.

### Output Description:
Given that `k` is an integer, the output of `ceil(k / 2)` depends on whether `k` is even or odd:
- If `k` is even, `k / 2` is already an integer, so `ceil(k / 2)` will simply be `k / 2`.
- If `k` is odd, `k / 2` will be a decimal number, and `ceil(k / 2)` will round it up to the next whole number.

Thus, the output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where ceil(k / 2) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k / 2)**
