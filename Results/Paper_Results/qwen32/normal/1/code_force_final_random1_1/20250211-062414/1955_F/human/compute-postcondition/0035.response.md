The value of `cnt` is incremented by the floor division of `x` by 2. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p_4`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged. Since `x` is the next element in the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, the value of `cnt` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_4` is an integer between 0 and 200, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list `a`, `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`**.
