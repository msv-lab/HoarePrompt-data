The code snippet reassigns the variable `a` to a new list of integers obtained from the input. This means the original list `a` is replaced with the new list of integers provided by the user.

Since the new list `a` is derived from the input, the sum `cnt` which was previously calculated as the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the original list `a` is now invalid and needs to be recalculated based on the new list `a`.

The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p_4`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_4` is an integer between 0 and 200, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the new list `a`.**
