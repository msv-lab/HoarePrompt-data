The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p_4`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p_1` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_4` is an integer between 0 and 200, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cnt` is 1.

Output State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_4` is an integer between 0 and 200, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cnt` is 1**.
