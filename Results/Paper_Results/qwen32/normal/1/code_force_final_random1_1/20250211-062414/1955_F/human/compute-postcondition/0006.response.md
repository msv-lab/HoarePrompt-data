In this task, the loop head contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation, the only relevant variable to adjust is the result of `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `p` is a list of integers, each rounded down to the nearest even number from the new input values. The loop continues as long as the integer value obtained from `input()` is greater than 0.

Since the loop uses `int(input())` to determine the number of iterations, we need to ensure that the next call to `input()` returns a value that is still greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that the next input value is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers, each rounded down to the nearest even number from the new input values, and the next input value must be greater than 0**.
