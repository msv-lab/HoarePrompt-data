To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variable `cnt`. The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a` and increments `cnt` by `math.floor(x / 2)`.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final value of `cnt` will be the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the list `a`.

Let's denote the length of the list `a` as `n`. After `n` iterations, the final value of `cnt` will be:

\[ \text{final\_cnt} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \left\lfloor \frac{a[i]}{2} \right\rfloor \]

The other variables (`p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p_4`, `t`) remain unchanged throughout the loop since they are not modified within the loop body.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop can be described as follows:

Output State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_4` is an integer between 0 and 200, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the list `a`.**

In simpler terms, the final state of `cnt` is the total sum of half the values (rounded down) of all elements in the list `a`, while the other variables retain their initial values.
