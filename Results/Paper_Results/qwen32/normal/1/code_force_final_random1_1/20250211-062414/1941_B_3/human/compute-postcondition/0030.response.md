The code `a[i] -= opNum` means that the value at index `i` in the list `a` is decreased by the value of `opNum`. Given that `opNum` is defined as `a[i]`, the operation effectively sets `a[i]` to `a[i] - a[i]`, which results in `a[i]` being 0.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` remains the same; `a[i]` is 0; `opNum` is `a[i]`.**
