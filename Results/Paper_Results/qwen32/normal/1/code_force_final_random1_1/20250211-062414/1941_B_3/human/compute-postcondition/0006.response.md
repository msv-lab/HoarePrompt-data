The initial state provides several pieces of information about the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers with specific conditions regarding its first and last elements.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Given this, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not change based on the values of the variables described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
