The code snippet modifies the value of `a[i + 2]` by subtracting `opNum` from it. No other variables are directly modified by this code.

Given:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `stop` is True if `a[i]` was less than 0 before the operation
- `opNum` is `a[i]` before the operation
- `a[i]` is 0
- `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`

After executing the line `a[i + 2] -= opNum`, the value of `a[i + 2]` changes to `a[i + 2] - opNum`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `stop` is True if `a[i]` was less than 0 before the operation, `opNum` is `a[i]` before the operation, `a[i]` is 0, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - opNum`.**
