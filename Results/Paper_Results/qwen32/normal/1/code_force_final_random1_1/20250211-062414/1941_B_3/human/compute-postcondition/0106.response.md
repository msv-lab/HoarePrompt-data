The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n - 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it would now be 4 at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n - 2`.

Given that `n` is at least 3, let's consider the state adjustments:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` must be such that `i < n - 2` holds true for the loop to continue.

Since `i` is incremented by 1, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 4 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `n` must be at least 6 (since 4 < 6 - 2).

State: **`i` is 4, `n` is at least 6**
