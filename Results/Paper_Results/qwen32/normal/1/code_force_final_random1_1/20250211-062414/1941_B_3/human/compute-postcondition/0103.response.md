The code snippet `a[i] -= opNum` modifies the element at index `i` in the list `a` by subtracting the value of `opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is defined as `a[i]`, the operation effectively sets `a[i]` to `a[i] - a[i]`, which results in `a[i]` being set to 0.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `i` is incremented by 1 (precondition still holds).
- `n` is at least 3 (precondition still holds).
- `opNum` was `a[i]` before the operation, and now `a[i]` is 0, so `opNum` is no longer relevant to the current state of `a[i]`.
- `stop` is True if `a[i]` is less than 0, causing a break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since `a[i]` is now 0, the condition for `stop` to be True is not met, so `stop` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is at least 3, `a[i]` is 0, `stop` remains unchanged**.
