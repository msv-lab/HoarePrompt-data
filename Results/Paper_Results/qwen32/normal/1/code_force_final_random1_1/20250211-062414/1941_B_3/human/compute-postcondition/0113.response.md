Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state:

- `i` is 4
- `n` is at least 6
- `a[4]` is 0
- `opNum` is 0
- `stop` retains its previous value (either True or False)

The code snippet is:
```python
a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
```

Since `i` is 4, `a[i + 1]` refers to `a[5]`. The operation `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` means `a[5]` will be decreased by `2 * opNum`. Given that `opNum` is 0, `2 * opNum` is also 0. Therefore, `a[5]` remains unchanged.

The only variable that could potentially change is `a[5]`, but since `2 * opNum` is 0, `a[5]` does not change. The value of `a[5]` was not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it remains the same.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is at least 6, `a[4]` is 0, `a[5]` retains its previous value, `opNum` is 0, `stop` retains its previous value (either True or False).**
