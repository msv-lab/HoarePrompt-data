The code snippet `a[i] -= opNum` modifies the value of `a[i]` by subtracting `opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is defined as `a[i]`, this operation effectively sets `a[i]` to `a[i] - a[i]`, which results in `a[i]` being 0.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `i` remains `i + 1`.
- `n` remains an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `stop` remains True if `a[i]` was less than 0 before the operation (though now `a[i]` is 0).
- `opNum` remains `a[i]` before the operation (though now `a[i]` is 0).

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `stop` is True if `a[i]` was less than 0 before the operation, `opNum` is `a[i]` before the operation, `a[i]` is 0**.
