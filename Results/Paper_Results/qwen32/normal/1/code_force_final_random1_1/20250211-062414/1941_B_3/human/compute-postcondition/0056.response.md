To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and the list `a`. The variable `_` being incremented by 1 is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted. Similarly, `t`, `numTest`, `opNum`, and `stop` are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(0, n - 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value. All other variables (`t`, `numTest`, `n`, `a`, `opNum`, and `stop`) remain unchanged.

Let's summarize the adjustments:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `t` remains the same.
- `numTest` remains the same.
- `opNum` remains the same.
- `stop` remains the same.

So, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 4 at the start of the next iteration. The state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`_` is incremented by 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input with `a[i]` now equal to 0 and `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged; `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged; `opNum` is the original value of `a[i]` which is 0; `stop` is False; `i` is 4** (assuming `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration).

If `i` was some other value, say `k`, at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `k + 1`.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can generalize this as follows:

State: **`_` is incremented by 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input with `a[i]` now equal to 0 and `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged; `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged; `opNum` is the original value of `a[i]` which is 0; `stop` is False; `i` is `i + 1`**
