Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` remains the same; `stop` is `True`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. The value of `n` stays unchanged. The variable `stop` remains `True`. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
