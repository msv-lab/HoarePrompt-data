The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, or `b` mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`, the output will always be the string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is straightforward and outputs the literal string `'YES'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
