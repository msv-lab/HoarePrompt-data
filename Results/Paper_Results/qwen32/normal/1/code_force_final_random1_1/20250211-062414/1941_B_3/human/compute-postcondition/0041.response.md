Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first `n-2` elements are 0. If at least one of the last two elements of `a` is not 0, then `a` remains unchanged. If both of the last two elements of `a` are 0, then they remain 0. If `stop` is True, then `stop` remains True. Otherwise, `stop` remains False.**
