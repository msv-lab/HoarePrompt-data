The given code snippet modifies the value of `a[i + 2]` by subtracting `opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is the original value of `a[i]`, which is 0, the operation `a[i + 2] -= opNum` does not change the value of `a[i + 2]`. Therefore, no actual change occurs in the list `a`.

Here is the output state:

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input with `a[i]` now equal to 0 and `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged; `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged; `opNum` is the original value of `a[i]` which is 0; `stop` is False.**
