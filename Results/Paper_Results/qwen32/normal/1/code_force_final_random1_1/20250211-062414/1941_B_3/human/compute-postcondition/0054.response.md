The code snippet modifies the value of `a[i + 1]` by subtracting `2 * opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is the original value of `a[i]` and `a[i]` is currently 0, `opNum` is also 0. Therefore, `2 * opNum` equals 0, and `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input with `a[i]` now equal to 0 and `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged; `opNum` is the original value of `a[i]` which is 0; `stop` is False.**
