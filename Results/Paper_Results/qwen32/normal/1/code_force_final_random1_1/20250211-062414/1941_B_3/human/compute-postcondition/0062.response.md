The code snippet `a[i] -= opNum` modifies the value of `a[i]` by subtracting `opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is 0, the value of `a[i]` does not change. Therefore, `a[i]` remains 0.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `_` is incremented by 1 (unchanged in the provided code snippet).
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (unchanged).
- `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1 (unchanged).
- `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 (unchanged).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input with `a[i]` now equal to 0 and `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` remain unchanged (only `a[i]` remains 0).
- `opNum` is 0 (unchanged).
- `stop` is True if `a[i]` was less than 0, otherwise `stop` remains False (unchanged, since `a[i]` is 0).
- `i` is `i + 1` (unchanged in the provided code snippet).

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input with `a[i]` now equal to 0 and `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` remain unchanged; `opNum` is 0; `stop` is True if `a[i]` was less than 0, otherwise `stop` remains False; `i` is `i + 1`.**
