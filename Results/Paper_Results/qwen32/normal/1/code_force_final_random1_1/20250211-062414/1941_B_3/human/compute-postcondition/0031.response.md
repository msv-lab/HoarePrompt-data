The code snippet modifies the value of `a[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is equal to `a[i]` and `a[i]` is 0, `opNum` is also 0. Therefore, `2 * opNum` equals 0, and `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` remains the same; `a[i]` is 0; `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged; `opNum` is 0.**
