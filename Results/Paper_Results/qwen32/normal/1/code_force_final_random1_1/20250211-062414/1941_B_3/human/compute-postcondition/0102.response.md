Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is at least 3, `opNum` is `a[i]`, and `stop` is True if `a[i]` is less than 0, causing a break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains unchanged and no break occurs.**

Natural Language: The value of `opNum` is now set to the value of `a[i]`. The conditions for `stop` remain the same: if `a[i]` is less than 0, `stop` becomes True and a break occurs; otherwise, `stop` remains unchanged. The values of `i`, `n`, and `stop` (except for the condition) are unchanged.
