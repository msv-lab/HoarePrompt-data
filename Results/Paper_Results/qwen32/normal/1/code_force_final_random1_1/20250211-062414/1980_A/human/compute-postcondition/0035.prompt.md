Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `freq` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `missing` is 7m - k if m > k else 6m; `t`, `test_cases`, `results` remain unchanged; `n` is the first element of `test_cases[_]`; `m` is the second element of `test_cases[_]`; `a` is the third element of `test_cases[_]`; `_` is incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for prob in a:
    freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `freq` is a list where one of the elements from index 0 to 6 is incremented by 1, `missing` is 7m - k if m > k else 6m, `t`, `test_cases`, `results` remain unchanged, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[_]`, `m` is the second element of `test_cases[_]`, `a` is the third element of `test_cases[_]` and must have at least one element, `_` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `freq` is a list where one of the elements from index 0 to 6 is incremented by 1 (and now the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is further incremented by 1), `missing` is 7m - k if m > k else 6m, `t`, `test_cases`, `results` remain unchanged, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[_]`, `m` is the second element of `test_cases[_]`, `a` is the third element of `test_cases[_]` and must have at least one element, `_` is incremented by 1, `prob` is the next element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `freq` is a list where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by 1 (twice in total if it was already incremented once), `missing` is 7m - k if m > k else 6m, `t`, `test_cases`, `results` remain unchanged, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[_]`, `m` is the second element of `test_cases[_]`, `a` is the third element of `test_cases[_]` and must have at least one element, `_` is incremented by 1, `prob` is the next element in the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
