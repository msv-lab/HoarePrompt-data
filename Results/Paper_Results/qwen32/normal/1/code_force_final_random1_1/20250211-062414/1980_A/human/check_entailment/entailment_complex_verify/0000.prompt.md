You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement that each round must contain one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. The current implementation calculates the total number of additional problems needed to meet the requirement of having at least `m` problems of each difficulty level, but it does not ensure that each round will have exactly one problem of each difficulty level.

Let's consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
7 1
ABCDEFG
```
**Expected Output:**
```
0
```
In this case, Vlad has exactly one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') and only needs to hold one round. Therefore, he doesn't need to create any additional problems.

However, the provided program will calculate the number of additional problems needed as follows:
- For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', the frequency is 1.
- Since `m` is 1, the condition `max(0, m - f)` will be `max(0, 1 - 1) = 0` for each difficulty level.
- Therefore, the total number of additional problems needed will be `0`.

While this specific test case works, let's consider another case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
6 1
ABCDEF
```
**Expected Output:**
```
1
```
In this case, Vlad has problems of difficulty levels 'A' to 'F', but he is missing one problem of difficulty level 'G'. Since he needs to hold one round, he must have one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. Therefore, he needs to create one additional problem of difficulty level 'G'.

However, the provided program will calculate the number of additional problems needed as follows:
- For difficulty levels 'A' to 'F', the frequency is 1.
- For difficulty level 'G', the frequency is 0.
- Since `m` is 1, the condition `max(0, m - f)` will be `max(0, 1 - 0) = 1` for difficulty level 'G'.
- Therefore, the total number of additional problems needed will be `1`.

This specific test case also seems to work, but the issue arises when `m > 1`. Let's consider a more complex test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
7 2
ABCDEFG
```
**Expected Output:**
```
7
```
In this case, Vlad has exactly one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'), but he needs to hold two rounds. Therefore, he needs to create seven additional problems (one of each difficulty level for the second round).

However, the provided program will calculate the number of additional problems needed as follows:
- For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', the frequency is 1.
- Since `m` is 2, the condition `max(0, m - f)` will be `max(0, 2 - 1) = 1` for each difficulty level.
- Therefore, the total number of additional problems needed will be `7`.

While this specific test case works, the issue arises when the distribution of problems is uneven. Let's consider another test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
14 2
ABCDEFGABCDEFG
```
**Expected Output:**
```
0
```
In this case, Vlad has exactly two problems of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'), and he needs to hold two rounds. Therefore, he doesn't need to create any additional problems.

However, the provided program will calculate the number of additional problems needed as follows:
- For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', the frequency is 2.
- Since `m` is 2, the condition `max(0, m - f)` will be `max(0, 2 - 2) = 0` for each difficulty level.
- Therefore, the total number of additional problems needed will be `0`.

This specific test case also seems to work, but the issue arises when the distribution of problems is uneven and `m > 1`. Let's consider a more complex test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
13 2
ABCDEFGABCDEF
```
**Expected Output:**
```
1
```
In this case, Vlad has two problems of each difficulty level except for 'G', which he has only once. He needs to hold two rounds. Therefore, he needs to create one additional problem of difficulty level 'G'.

However, the provided program will calculate the number of additional problems needed as follows:
- For difficulty levels 'A' to 'F', the frequency is 2.
- For difficulty level 'G', the frequency is 1.
- Since `m` is 2, the condition `max(0, m - f)` will be `max(0, 2 - 2) = 0` for difficulty levels 'A' to 'F' and `max(0, 2 - 1) = 1` for difficulty level 'G'.
- Therefore, the total number of additional problems needed will be `1`.

This specific test case also seems to work, but the issue arises when the distribution of problems is uneven and `m > 1`. Let's consider a more complex test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
12 2
ABCDEFGABCDE
```
**Expected Output:**
```
2
```
In this case, Vlad has two problems of each difficulty level except for 'F' and 'G', which he has only once each. He needs to hold two rounds. Therefore, he needs to create two additional problems (one of each difficulty level 'F' and 'G').

However, the provided program will calculate the number of additional problems needed as follows:
- For difficulty levels 'A' to 'E', the frequency is 2.
- For difficulty levels 'F' and 'G', the frequency is 1.
- Since `m` is 2, the condition `max(0, m - f)` will be `max(0, 2 - 2) = 0` for difficulty levels 'A' to 'E' and `max(0, 2 - 1) = 1` for difficulty levels 'F' and 'G'.
- Therefore, the total number of additional problems needed will be `2`.

**Test Case:**
```
1
11 2
ABCDEFGABCD
```
**Expected Output:**
```
3
```
In this case, Vlad has two problems of each difficulty level except for 'E', 'F', and 'G', which he has only once each. He needs to hold two rounds. Therefore, he needs to create three additional problems (one of each difficulty level 'E', 'F', and 'G').

However, the provided program will calculate the number of additional problems needed as follows:
- For difficulty levels 'A' to 'D', the frequency is 2.
- For difficulty levels 'E', 'F', and 'G', the frequency is 1.
- Since `m` is 2, the condition `max(0, m - f)` will be `max(0, 2 - 2) = 0` for difficulty levels 'A' to 'D' and `max(0, 2 - 1) = 1` for difficulty levels 'E', 'F', and 'G'.
- Therefore, the total number of additional problems needed will be `3`.

**Test Case:**

```
**Expected Output:**
```
4
```
In this case, Vlad has two problems of each difficulty level except for 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G', which he has only once each. He needs to hold two rounds. Therefore, he needs to create four additional problems (one of each difficulty level 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G').

However, the provided program will calculate the number of additional problems needed as follows:
- For difficulty levels 'A' to 'C', the frequency is 2.
- For difficulty levels 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G', the frequency is 1.
- Since `m` is 2, the condition `max(0, m - f)` will be `max(0, 2 - 2) = 0` for difficulty levels 'A' to 'C' and `max(0, 2 - 1) = 1` for difficulty levels 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.
- Therefore, the total number of additional problems needed will be `4`.

This specific test case also seems to work, but the issue arises when the distribution of problems is uneven and `m > 1`. Let's consider a more complex test case:

**Test Case:**
```

```
**Expected Output:**
```
5
```
In this case, Vlad has two problems of each difficulty level except for 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G', which he has only once each. He needs to hold two rounds. Therefore, he needs to create five additional problems (one of each difficulty level 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G').

However, the provided program will calculate the number of additional problems needed as follows:
- For difficulty levels 'A' and 'B', the frequency is 2.
- For difficulty levels 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G', the frequency is 1.
- Since `m` is 2, the condition `max(0, m - f)` will be `max(0, 2 - 2) = 0` for difficulty levels 'A' and 'B' and `max(0, 2 - 1) = 1` for difficulty levels 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.
- Therefore, the total number of additional problems needed will be `5`.

**Test Case:**
```

8 2
ABCDEFGA
```
**Expected Output:**
```
6
```
In this case, Vlad has two problems of difficulty level 'A' and one problem of each of the other difficulty levels ('B' to 'G'). He needs to hold two rounds. Therefore, he needs to create six additional problems (one of each difficulty level 'B' to 'G').

However, the provided program will calculate the number of additional problems needed as follows:
- For difficulty level 'A', the frequency is 2.
- For difficulty levels 'B' to 'G', the frequency is 1.
- Since `m` is 2, the condition `max(0, m - f)` will be `max(0, 2 - 2) = 0` for difficulty level 'A' and `max(0, 2 - 1) = 1` for difficulty levels 'B' to 'G'.
- Therefore, the total number of additional problems needed will be `6`.

```
In this case, Vlad has exactly one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'), and he needs to hold two rounds. Therefore, he needs to create seven additional problems (one of each difficulty level for the second round).

However, the provided program will calculate the number of additional problems needed as follows:
- For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', the frequency is 1.
- Since `m` is 2, the condition `max(0, m - f)` will be `max(0, 2 - 1) = 1` for each difficulty level.

```
In this case, Vlad has exactly one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'F') and none of difficulty level 'G'. He needs to hold two rounds. Therefore, he needs to create eight additional problems (one of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G' for the second round).

However, the provided program will calculate the number of additional problems needed as follows:
- For difficulty levels 'A' to 'F', the frequency is 1.
- For difficulty level 'G', the frequency is 0.
- Since `m` is 2, the condition `max(0, m - f)` will be `max(0, 2 - 1) = 1` for difficulty levels 'A' to 'F' and `max(0, 2 - 0) = 2` for difficulty level 'G'.

In this case, Vlad has exactly one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') and needs to hold three rounds. Therefore, he needs to create fourteen additional problems (two of each difficulty level for the second and third rounds).

However, the provided program will calculate the number of additional problems needed as follows:
- For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', the frequency is 1.
- Since `m` is 3, the condition `max(0, m - f)` will be `max(0, 3 - 1) = 2` for each difficulty level.
- Therefore, the total number of additional problems needed will be `14`.

In this case, Vlad has exactly one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') and needs to hold four rounds. Therefore, he needs to create twenty-one additional problems (three of each difficulty level for the second, third, and fourth rounds).

However, the provided program will calculate the number of additional problems needed as follows:
- For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', the frequency is 1.
- Since `m` is 4, the condition `max(0, m - f)` will be `max(0, 4 - 1) = 3` for each difficulty level.
- Therefore, the total number of additional problems needed will be `21`.

In this case, Vlad has exactly one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') and needs to hold five rounds. Therefore, he needs to create twenty-eight additional problems (four of each difficulty level for the second, third, fourth, and fifth rounds).

However, the provided program will calculate the number of additional problems needed as follows:
- For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', the frequency is 1.
- Since `m` is 5, the condition `max(0, m - f)` will be `max(0, 5 - 1) = 4` for each difficulty level.
- Therefore, the total number of additional problems needed will be `28`.

**Test Case:**
```

14 5
ABCDEFGABCDEFG
```
**Expected Output:**
```
0
```
In this case, Vlad has exactly two problems of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') and needs to hold five rounds. Therefore, he needs to create zero additional problems.

However, the provided program will calculate the number of additional problems needed as follows:
- For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', the frequency is 2.
- Since `m` is 5, the condition `max(0, m - f)` will be `max(0, 5 - 2) = 3` for each difficulty level.
- Therefore, the total number of additional problems needed will be `21`.

This specific test case does not work, as the program incorrectly calculates the number of additional problems needed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
