Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Recap
Vlad needs to hold `m` rounds, each containing one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. Given `n` problems with their respective difficulty levels, we need to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create.

### Code Analysis
The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases. Each test case includes `n`, `m`, and a string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems. The function calculates the frequency of each difficulty level and then determines how many additional problems are needed to ensure that for each difficulty level, there are at least `m` problems available.

### Function Summary
The function summary correctly describes the intended behavior of `func_1`: it calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed such that each difficulty level has at least `m` problems.

### Detailed Reasoning
Let's break down the logic of the function and see if it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Frequency Calculation**: The function counts the occurrences of each difficulty level using a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (for 'A' to 'G').
2. **Missing Problems Calculation**: For each difficulty level, it calculates how many more problems are needed to reach `m` problems using `max(0, m - f)`, where `f` is the current frequency of the difficulty level.
3. **Summing Up**: It sums up the missing problems for all difficulty levels to get the total number of additional problems needed.

### Test Cases Validation
