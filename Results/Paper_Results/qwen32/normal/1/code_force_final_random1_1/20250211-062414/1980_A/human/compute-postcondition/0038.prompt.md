Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, an integer m such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, a = test_cases[_]
    freq = [0] * 7
    for prob in a:
        freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
    missing = sum(max(0, m - f) for f in freq)
    results.append(missing)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `freq` is a list of seven integers representing the frequency of characters 'A' to 'G' in the string `a`; `missing` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and `m - f` for each `f` in `freq`; `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `m` remain unchanged; `results` now includes the value of `missing` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `freq` is [0, k, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `missing` is 7m - k if m > k else 6m; `t`, `test_cases`, `results` remain unchanged; `n` and `m` are updated to the first two elements of `test_cases[_]`; `a` is updated to the third element of `test_cases[_]`; `results` now includes `missing`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `freq` is [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3]; `missing` is 7m - 6; `results` contains the element `7m - 6`; `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `a`, and `_` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
