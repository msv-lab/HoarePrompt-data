The code snippet `b = input()` changes the value of `b` to whatever is input by the user. Since the initial state specifies that `b` was a string representing a positive integer, after the input operation, `b` will take on the new value provided by the user.

The variables `i` and `k` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the input operation. Specifically, `i` continues to be equal to `a`, and `k` retains its initial state based on whether the original `b` contained the character '1'.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `a`, `b` is the new input string, and `k` is either an empty list if the new `b` does not contain the character '1', or a list containing the count of '1' in the new `b` if the new `b` contains the character '1'.**
