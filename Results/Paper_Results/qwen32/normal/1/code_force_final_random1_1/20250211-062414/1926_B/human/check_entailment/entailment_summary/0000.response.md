### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Square Shape**: 
   - Consists of `k` consecutive rows, each with `k` consecutive '1's.
   - All '1's are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

2. **Triangle Shape**:
   - Consists of `k` consecutive rows, where the `i-th` row has `2*i - 1` consecutive '1's.
   - The central '1's are located in one column.
   - An upside-down triangle is also considered valid.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
- For each test case, it reads the grid size (`n`) and the grid itself.
- It collects the count of '1's in each non-empty row into a list `k`.
- It checks if the first two elements of `k` are equal. If they are, it prints "SQUARE"; otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

#### Issues with the Program:
- **Square Detection**: The program correctly identifies squares when the first two rows have the same number of '1's, assuming that the square starts from the first row. However, this is not sufficient to confirm a square. The program does not verify that all rows in the square have the same number of '1's and that these '1's are aligned properly.
  
- **Triangle Detection**: The program assumes that if the first two rows do not have the same number of '1's, the shape must be a triangle. This is incorrect because the triangle could start later in the grid, or the first few rows might not contain any '1's.

- **General Shape Verification**: The program does not verify the overall structure of the shape (whether it is a perfect square or triangle according to the problem definition).

### Conclusion:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly identify whether the shape is a square or a triangle based on the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**
