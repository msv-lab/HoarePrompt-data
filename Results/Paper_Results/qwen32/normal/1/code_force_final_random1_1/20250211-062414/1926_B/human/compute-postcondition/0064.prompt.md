Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    k = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        b = input()
        if '1' in b:
            k.append(b.count('1'))
    if k[0] == k[1]:
        print('SQUARE')
    else:
        print('TRIANGLE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is greater than 0; `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from each of the `t` input strings that contained at least one '1', with the first and second elements of `k` being equal if the condition `k[0] == k[1]` holds, otherwise `k[0]` is not equal to `k[1]`; `b` is the value of the last input string processed by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is greater than 0; `k` is a list that includes the count of '1's in each input string `b` that contains at least one '1'; `b` is the last input string processed by the loop; `i` is equal to `a`. Additionally, `k[0]` is either equal to `k[1]` or not equal to `k[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is equal to `a`; `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from each of the input strings `b` that contain '1's. If the count of '1's in the first input string `b[0]` is equal to the count of '1's in the second input string `b[1]`, then `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`. Otherwise, the count of '1's in `b[0]` is not equal to the count of '1's in `b[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
