Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is greater than 0; `b` is the user's input; if '1' is in `b`, then `k` is [1, 1]; otherwise, `k` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The value of `b` is updated to the user's input. The conditions regarding `t`, `n`, `grid`, `a`, and `k` remain unchanged unless the input `b` contains '1', in which case `k` is set to [1, 1]. If '1' is not in `b`, `k` remains an empty list.
