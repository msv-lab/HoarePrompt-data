Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. Here's why:

1. **Square Detection**: The program checks if the counts of `1`s in the first two rows are equal to determine if the shape is a square. However, this is not sufficient. A square requires that all rows have the same number of `1`s and that these `1`s are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

2. **Triangle Detection**: The program assumes that if the counts of `1`s in the first two rows are not equal, the shape must be a triangle. However, this is not accurate. A triangle has specific patterns of `1`s that need to be checked, such as the number of `1`s increasing by 2 for each subsequent row until reaching a maximum, and then decreasing by 2 for each row afterward (for an upside-down triangle).

Here's a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
001
011
111
```

**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```

**Actual Output:**
```
SQUARE
```

In this example, the counts of `1`s in the first two rows are different (1 and 2), but the program incorrectly identifies it as a square because it doesn't properly check for the triangle pattern.

Another counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0010
0110
1111
0110
```

**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```

**Actual Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```

While this input might seem to work, the program doesn't actually verify the triangle pattern correctly. For instance, if we modify the last row to make it invalid:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0010
0110
1111
0010
```

**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```

**Actual Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```

But the program should ideally fail here since the last row doesn't fit the triangle pattern.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to implement proper checks for both square and triangle patterns as described in the problem statement.
