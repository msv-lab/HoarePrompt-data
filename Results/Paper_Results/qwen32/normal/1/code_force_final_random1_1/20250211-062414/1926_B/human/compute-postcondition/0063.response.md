Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `a`; `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from each of the input strings `b` that contain '1's. If the count of '1's in the first input string `b[0]` is equal to the count of '1's in the second input string `b[1]`, then `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`. Otherwise, the count of '1's in `b[0]` is not equal to the count of '1's in `b[1]`.**
