Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is greater than 0; `k` is an empty list; `b` is the value of the last input string processed by the loop; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and `i < a`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is greater than 0; `k` is a list that includes the count of '1's in the string `b` if `b` contains at least one '1'; `b` is the new input string; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and `i < a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is greater than 0; `k` is a list that includes the count of '1's in the string `b` if `b` contains at least one '1', and if `b` contained at least one '1', `k` now includes the count of '1's in the newly provided string `b`; `b` is the new input string; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and `i < a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is greater than 0; `k` is a list that includes the count of '1's in the string `b` if `b` contains at least one '1', and if `b` contained at least one '1', `k` now includes the count of '1's in the newly provided string `b`; `b` is the new input string; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and `i < a`. If `b` contains at least one '1', the count of '1's in `b` is added to `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
