The `print('SQUARE')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'SQUARE'`.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

- The initial state provides details about various variables (`t`, `n`, `grid`, `a`, `k`, `b`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'SQUARE'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **SQUARE**
