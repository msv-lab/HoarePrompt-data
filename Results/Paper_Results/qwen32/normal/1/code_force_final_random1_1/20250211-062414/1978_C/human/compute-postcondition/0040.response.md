To determine the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the list `l` based on the value of `k` and the decrementing index `i`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop behavior:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n`: A positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
   - `k`: A non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) which has already been updated to `k // 2`.
   - `l`: A list containing integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = n-1` down to `i = 0`.
   - For each iteration:
     - If `k == 0`, the function returns the current state of `l`.
     - If `1 + i > k`, the last element of `l` is moved to the position `-k` in the list, and the function returns the modified `l`.
     - Otherwise, `k` is decremented by `i - 1`, the last element of `l` is removed, and inserted at the beginning of the list.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `k` becomes 0 or when the condition `1 + i > k` is met, causing the function to return the current state of `l`.

### Final Output State Analysis

Let's consider the scenarios where the loop completes all iterations:

- **Case 1**: `k` is sufficiently large such that it does not become 0 during the loop, and `1 + i` never exceeds `k` until `i` reaches 0.
  - In this case, the loop will perform `n` iterations, moving the last element of `l` to the front in each iteration.
  - After `n` iterations, the list `l` will be rotated `n` times, effectively returning to its original order.

- **Case 2**: `k` becomes 0 before the loop completes all `n` iterations.
  - The loop will terminate early, and the list `l` will be in a partially rotated state.

- **Case 3**: `1 + i > k` for some `i` before `k` becomes 0.
  - The loop will terminate early, and the list `l` will be in a state where the last element is moved to the position `-k`.

### Conclusion

Given the problem constraints and the provided output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will eventually terminate either when `k` becomes 0 or when `1 + i > k`. However, without specific values for `n` and `k`, we can only generalize the final state.

If `k` is large enough and `1 + i` never exceeds `k` until `i` reaches 0, the final state of `l` will be the same as the initial state because rotating a list `n` times results in the original list.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **[1, 2, ..., n]**

This means that after all iterations, the list `l` returns to its original order, containing integers from 1 to `n`.
