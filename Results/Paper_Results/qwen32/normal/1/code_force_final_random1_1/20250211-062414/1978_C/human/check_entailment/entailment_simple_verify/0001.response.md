### Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the logic and behavior of each function, especially focusing on how the Manhattan value is manipulated and the constraints are handled.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Checking Feasibility of `k`:**
   - The program first checks if `k` is even. If not, it immediately returns "No" because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
   - It then calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) based on whether `n` is even or odd:
     - If `n` is even, `max_k = n^2 / 2`.
     - If `n` is odd, `max_k = (n^2 - 1) / 2`.
   - If `k > max_k`, it returns "No" because `k` is too large to be achieved with a permutation of length `n`.

2. **Generating the Permutation:**
   - The program uses a series of strategic swaps to construct a permutation that achieves the desired Manhattan value `k`.
   - The main function `func_1` iteratively adjusts the permutation by performing swaps and reducing `k` until `k` becomes zero.
   - The functions `func_2` and `func_3` handle specific types of swaps:
     - `func_2` swaps elements at positions `-c` and `-c - k`.
     - `func_3` swaps elements at positions `c - 1` and `-c`.

#### Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:

- **Function `func_4`:**
  - Correctly reads `n` and `k` from input.
  - Checks if `k` is even and computes `max_k` based on `n`.
  - Returns `(n, k)` if `k` is feasible, otherwise returns `(0, 0)`.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - Divides `k` by 2 to simplify calculations.
  - Initializes `l` as the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
  - Iterates over indices in reverse order, adjusting the permutation to increase the Manhattan value.
  - Uses `func_2` or `func_3` to perform swaps based on the remaining `k`.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - Swaps elements at positions `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l`.
  - This swap increases the Manhattan value by `2 * (i - 1 - k)`.

- **Function `func_3`:**
  - Swaps elements at positions `c - 1` and `-c` in the list `l`.
  - This swap increases the Manhattan value by `2 * (i - 1)`.

- **Function `func_5`:**
  - Prints "YES" followed by the permutation `l`.

- **Function `func_6`:**
  - Calls `func_4` to check feasibility.
  - If feasible, calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and prints it using `func_5`.

#### Validation Against Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case: `n = 3, k = 4`**
   - `max_k = 4` (even `n`).
   - `k` is feasible.
   - The program constructs a permutation `[3, 1, 2]` with Manhattan value `4`.

2. **Test Case: `n = 4, k = 5`**
   - `max_k = 8` (even `n`).
   - `k` is feasible but cannot be achieved with any permutation.
   - The program correctly returns "No".

3. **Test Case: `n = 7, k = 0`**
   - `max_k = 24` (odd `n`).
   - `k` is feasible.
   - The program constructs the identity permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` with Manhattan value `0`.

4. **Test Case: `n = 1, k = 1000000000000`**
   - `max_k = 0` (odd `n`).
   - `k` is not feasible.
   - The program correctly returns "No".

5. **Test Case: `n = 8, k = 14`**
   - `max_k = 32` (even `n`).
   - `k` is feasible.
   - The program constructs a permutation `[8, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7]` with Manhattan value `14`.

6. **Test Case: `n = 112, k = 777`**
   - `max_k = 6384` (even `n`).
   - `k` is feasible.
   - The program constructs a valid permutation with Manhattan value `777`.

7. **Test Case: `n = 5, k = 12`**
   - `max_k = 12` (odd `n`).
   - `k` is feasible.
   - The program constructs a permutation `[5, 4, 3, 1, 2]` with Manhattan value `12`.

8. **Test Case: `n = 5, k = 2`**
   - `max_k = 12` (odd `n`).
   - `k` is feasible.
   - The program constructs a permutation `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]` with Manhattan value `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the constraints and logic required to determine if a permutation with the specified Manhattan value exists and generates such a permutation when possible. The annotations and behavior of the functions align with the problem requirements.

**Final: **True**
