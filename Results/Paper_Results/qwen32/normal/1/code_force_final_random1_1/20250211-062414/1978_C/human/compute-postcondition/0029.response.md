To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and under what conditions it terminates. Let's break down the loop and the provided output states to identify the pattern.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over `i` starting from `n` down to `-1` with a step of `-2`. For each iteration:
- `c` is incremented by 1.
- If `k` becomes 0, the function returns `l`.
- If `k` is less than `i - 1`, the function calls `func_2(c, k, l)` and returns its result.
- Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - i + 1` and `l` is updated to the result of `func_3(c, l)`.

### Iteration Details
Let's summarize the changes after each iteration based on the given output states:

1. **First Iteration**:
   - `i = n`
   - `k = k - n + 1`
   - `l = func_3(1, l)`
   - `c = 1`

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `i = n - 2`
   - `k = (k - n + 1) - (n - 2) + 1 = k - 2n + 4`
   - `l = func_3(2, l)`
   - `c = 2`

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `i = n - 4`
   - `k = (k - 2n + 4) - (n - 4) + 1 = k - 3n + 9`
   - `l = func_3(3, l)`
   - `c = 3`

From these patterns, we can generalize the update rules for `k` and `l` after `c` iterations:
- `k = k - c * n + (c^2 + 3c + 2) / 2`
- `l = func_3(c, l)`

### Termination Condition
The loop terminates when `i` becomes `-1`, which means it will run `(n // 2) + 1` times if `n` is odd, or `n // 2` times if `n` is even.

### Final Output State
Let's compute the final values of `k` and `l` after all iterations:

- **Number of Iterations**: `(n // 2) + 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2` if `n` is even.
- **Final `k`**: The value of `k` after all iterations can be computed using the generalized formula.
- **Final `l`**: The value of `l` is the result of applying `func_3` repeatedly.

Since the exact form of `func_3` is not provided, we'll denote the final `l` as `func_3((n // 2) + 1, l)` if `n` is odd, or `func_3(n // 2, l)` if `n` is even.

### Conclusion
The final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - ((n // 2) * n + (3 * (n // 2)^2 + 5 * (n // 2) + 2) / 2)`, `l` is the result of `func_3((n // 2) + 1, l)` if `n` is odd, or `func_3(n // 2, l)` if `n` is even, `c` is `(n // 2) + 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2` if `n` is even.**

In simpler terms, the loop runs a specific number of times based on whether `n` is odd or even, updating `k` and `l` accordingly until it terminates.
