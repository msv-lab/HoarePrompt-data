The value of `k` is updated to `k - i + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged unless the new value of `k` triggers one of the return conditions.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `i` is `n - 4`
- `k` is `k - n + 3`
- `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`
- `c` is 3

After executing `k = k - i + 1`:
- The new value of `k` is `(k - n + 3) - (n - 4) + 1`, which simplifies to `k - 2*n + 8`.

The return conditions are:
- If `k < i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(3, k, l)`.
- If `k` is not less than `i - 1` and `k` equals 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(2, l)`.

Since the value of `k` has changed, we need to check if it meets any of the return conditions. However, the problem does not specify the exact values of `k` and `i`, so we cannot determine if a return occurs. We only update the value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 4`, `k` is `k - 2*n + 8`, `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `c` is 3**.
