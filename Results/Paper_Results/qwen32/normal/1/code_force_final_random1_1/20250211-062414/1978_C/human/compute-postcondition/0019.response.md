Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `n` is a positive integer
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `k` is `k - n + 1`
- `l` is the result of `func_3(1, l)`
- `c` is 2
- If `k < i - 1`, the function returns the result of `func_2(2, k - n + 1, func_3(1, l))`
- If `k >= i - 1`, the function does not return and `k` remains `k - n + 1`

Code Snippet:
```python
k = k - i + 1
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - (n - 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `k - n + 3`.

Other Variables:
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `i` remains `n - 2`.
- `l` remains the result of `func_3(1, l)`.
- `c` remains 2.

The condition `k < i - 1` or `k >= i - 1` does not affect the assignment of `k` in the given code snippet. The function's return behavior is not triggered by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `k - n + 3`, `l` is the result of `func_3(1, l)`, `c` is 2**.
