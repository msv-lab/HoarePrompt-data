You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem of finding a permutation of length `n` with a specific Manhattan value `k`, or determining that no such permutation exists.

### Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation `p` of length `n` such that the Manhattan value \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |p_i - i| = k \).
   - If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is \( \frac{n^2}{2} \) if `n` is even, and \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \) if `n` is odd.
   - If `k` is greater than this maximum value, no such permutation exists.
   - The Manhattan value must be even because swapping two elements in the permutation changes the Manhattan value by an even amount.

3. **Analyzing the Program:**

   - **Function `func_4`:**
     - Reads input values `n` and `k`.
     - Checks if `k` is odd; if so, returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
     - Computes the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` based on whether `n` is even or odd.
     - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, returns `(0, 0)`.
     - Otherwise, returns `(n, k)` indicating a potential solution exists.

   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - Divides `k` by 2 (since the Manhattan value change due to swaps is always even).
     - Initializes a list `l` as the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - Iterates over indices in reverse order, adjusting the permutation to increase the Manhattan value.
     - Calls `func_2` or `func_3` to perform specific swaps based on the remaining `k`.

   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - Performs a swap between elements at positions `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l`.

   - **Function `func_3`:**
     - Swaps elements at positions `c - 1` and `-c` in the list `l`.

   - **Function `func_5`:**
     - Prints "YES" followed by the permutation `l`.

   - **Function `func_6`:**
     - Calls `func_4` to check if a solution exists.
     - If no solution exists (`n == 0`), prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and prints it using `func_5`.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly checks if `k` is achievable based on the maximum possible Manhattan value and whether `k` is even.
   - The logic for generating the permutation involves strategic swaps to achieve the desired Manhattan value, which aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a permutation with the specified Manhattan value exists and generates such a permutation when possible.

**Correctness: True**
