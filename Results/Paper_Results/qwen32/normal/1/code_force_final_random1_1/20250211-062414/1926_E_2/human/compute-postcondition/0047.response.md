To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop, which is `while n:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `n` is not zero.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\)
- `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`
- `k` is an input integer
- `L` is `[(n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2]`
- `tot` is 1
- `pow` is 2
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`

We need to ensure that `n` is not zero for the loop to execute again. Let's analyze how `n` is updated in each iteration:

In the previous iteration, `n` was updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should not be zero after this update. Therefore, before the update, `n` should be such that `n - (n + 1) // 2` is not zero.

Let's denote the value of `n` at the start of the current iteration as `n_old`. The update rule is:
\[ n_{\text{new}} = n_{\text{old}} - \left(\frac{n_{\text{old}} + 1}{2}\right) \]

For `n_{\text{new}}` to be non-zero:
\[ n_{\text{old}} - \left(\frac{n_{\text{old}} + 1}{2}\right) \neq 0 \]
\[ 2n_{\text{old}} - (n_{\text{old}} + 1) \neq 0 \]
\[ n_{\text{old}} - 1 \neq 0 \]
\[ n_{\text{old}} \neq 1 \]

So, `n` should not be 1 at the start of the current iteration for the loop to execute again. Since the loop modifies `n` to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, we need to ensure that after this operation, `n` remains non-zero.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted such that `n` is not 1. Given that `n` is derived from the previous state, we need to ensure that the previous `n` was such that after the update, `n` is still non-zero.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is not 1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is `[(n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2]`, `tot` is 1, `pow` is 2, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
