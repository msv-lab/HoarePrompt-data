The code snippet `m = (n + 1) // 2` reassigns the value of `m` to `(n + 1) // 2`. However, since `m` was already initialized with the same value `(n + 1) // 2`, the value of `m` does not change. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the redundant assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is `[(n + 1) // 2]`, `tot` is 1, `pow` is 2, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
