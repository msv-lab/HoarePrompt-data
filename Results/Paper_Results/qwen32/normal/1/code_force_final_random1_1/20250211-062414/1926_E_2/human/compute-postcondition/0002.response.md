The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state only mentions `t` as an input integer within a specific range. Since `n` and `k` are newly introduced and `t` is not affected by the given code, the output state includes the new values for `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` and `k` are input integers**.
