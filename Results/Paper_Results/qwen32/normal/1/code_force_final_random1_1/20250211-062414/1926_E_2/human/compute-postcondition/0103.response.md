The code snippet `tot += a` increments the value of `tot` by `a`. Given the initial state, `tot` was initially `a` unless `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, in which case `tot` would remain `a`. Since the code simply adds `a` to `tot`, we need to consider two scenarios:

1. If `tot` was initially `a`, then after the operation, `tot` becomes `a + a` or `2 * a`.
2. If `tot` remained `a` due to the condition `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, it still remains `a` because the condition would prevent the increment.

However, since the problem statement specifies that `tot` remains `a` only under a specific condition and does not change in that case, and since no other conditions are given that would prevent the increment, we assume the general case where `tot` is incremented by `a`.

Thus, the updated value of `tot` is `a + a` or `2 * a`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is `0`, `k` is `input_k`, `L` is `[1]`, `pow` is `4`, and `tot` is `2 * a`.**
