The code snippet provided sets `L` to an empty list. This means that the list `L` which previously contained values `[m1, m2, ..., mk]` is now empty. As a result, the sum of all elements in `L` (`tot`) would also become 0 because there are no elements in the list to sum. Additionally, the value of `pow` which was \(2^{\text{length of } L}\) would now be \(2^0\) which equals 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is `input_n`; `k` is `input_k`; `L` is `[]`; `tot` is `0`; `pow` is `1`.**
