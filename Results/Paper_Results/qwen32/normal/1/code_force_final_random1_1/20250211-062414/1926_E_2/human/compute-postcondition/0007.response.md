The code appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. Given that `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, and `n` is defined as `n - (n + 1) // 2`, the value of `m` is added to the initially empty list `L`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `n` remains as `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- `m` remains as `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `L` now contains one element, which is `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`; `k` is an input integer; `L` is a list containing one element `[m]`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
