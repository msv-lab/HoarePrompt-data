Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is [1], `pow` is 4, `tot` is `tot` (before increment) + `a`. The loop cannot execute another iteration as there are no more elements in `L`. If `tot` < `k` and `k` ≤ `tot` + `a`, the condition is met; otherwise, it is not.**

Explanation: The value of `tot` has been updated to `tot` (before increment) + `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
