The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer within a certain range, `n` is initially 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the single element 1, `tot` is 1, and `pow` is 2. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated to the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `L` is [1], `tot` is 1, `pow` is 2.**
