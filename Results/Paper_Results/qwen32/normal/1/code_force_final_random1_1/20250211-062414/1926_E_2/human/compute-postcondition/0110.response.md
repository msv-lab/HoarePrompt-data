The `while` loop condition is `p <= i - 1`. To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that this condition holds true.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `p <= i - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `p` is 2 and `i` is 2.

### Current Condition:
- With `p = 2` and `i = 2`, the condition `p <= i - 1` translates to `2 <= 2 - 1`, which simplifies to `2 <= 1`. This condition is false, so the loop does not execute.

### Required Adjustment:
- To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust `p` and/or `i` such that `p <= i - 1` becomes true.
- One straightforward way to achieve this is to decrease `p` to a value less than `i - 1` or increase `i` to a value greater than `p`.

### Possible Adjustments:
1. Decrease `p` to 1: This would make the condition `1 <= 2 - 1` which is `1 <= 1`, and this is true.
2. Increase `i` to 3: This would make the condition `2 <= 3 - 1` which is `2 <= 2`, and this is true.

Since the task specifies that we should only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`p` and `i`), either of these adjustments would suffice. For simplicity, let's choose to decrease `p` to 1.

### Final State:
- `t` remains an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` and `k` remain the initial values provided as input.
- `s` remains the accumulated sum of `(d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k` or `d` becomes 0.
- `i` remains 2.
- `d` remains the remaining value of `d` after the last iteration.
- `h` remains reduced to `h - (h + 1) // 2`.
- `p` is adjusted to 1.
- `g` remains the accumulated sum of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration plus `(h + 1) // 2` plus `(h + 1) // 2`.
- `f` remains `k - g`.
- `y` remains 2 if `k <= (n + 1) // 2`; otherwise, it follows the logic described in the problem.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is the initial value provided as input; `k` is the initial value provided as input; `s` is the accumulated sum of `(d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k` or `d` becomes 0; `i` is 2; `d` is the remaining value of `d` after the last iteration; `h` is reduced to `h - (h + 1) // 2`; `p` is 1; `g` is the accumulated sum of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration plus `(h + 1) // 2` plus `(h + 1) // 2`; `f` is `k - g`; and `y` is 2 if `k <= (n + 1) // 2`; otherwise, it follows the logic described in the problem.**
