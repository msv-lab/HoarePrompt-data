Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is at least 1, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 2, `a` is the next element in the list `L`, and `tot` is updated to `tot + a`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, then the program continues as described; otherwise, no further changes are made to the variables based on the given else part (which is none).**
