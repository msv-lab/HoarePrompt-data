Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is `0`; `k` is `input_k`; `L` is `[1]`; `pow` is `1`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `tot`.**
