Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to the value of the input, which is an integer within the specified range. The preconditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are mentioned to be defined in subsequent test cases.
