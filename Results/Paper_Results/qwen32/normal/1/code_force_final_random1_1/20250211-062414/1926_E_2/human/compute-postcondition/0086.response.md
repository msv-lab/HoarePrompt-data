To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variable `n` and appends values to the list `L`.

The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0. In each iteration:
- `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2.
- `n` is then reduced by `m`.
- `m` is appended to the list `L`.

This process effectively breaks down `n` into parts until `n` becomes 0. Each part is added to the list `L`. The loop terminates when `n` reaches 0.

Let's analyze the final state:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` will be 0 because the loop continues until `n` is reduced to 0.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `L` will contain all the parts of `n` that were calculated in each iteration.
- `tot` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `pow` remains 1 as it is not modified within the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is `0`; `k` is `input_k`; `L` is a list containing the sequence of values obtained from `(n + 1) // 2` in each iteration until `n` becomes 0; `tot` is `0`; `pow` is `1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `n` will be 0, and `L` will contain a series of integers that sum up to the original value of `n`, with each integer being half of the remaining `n` (rounded up) in each step of the loop. All other variables (`t`, `k`, `tot`, `pow`) remain unchanged.
