Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n`, `k`, `i`, and `d` are initial values provided as input.
- `s` is the accumulated sum of `(d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k` or `d` becomes 0.
- `h` is initialized to 0.
- `p` is set to `P_final`.
- `g` is set to `G_final`.
- `f` is calculated as `k - g`.
- `y` is explicitly set to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(y)
```

### Analysis:
The variable `y` is explicitly set to 2 in the initial state. There are no operations or conditions that modify the value of `y` before the `print` statement is executed. Therefore, the value of `y` remains 2.

### Conclusion:
The `print(y)` statement will output the value of `y`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
