The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `pow`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `tot`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` is 0; `k` is an input integer; `L` is a list containing the sequence of values that represent the successive halvings of the original `n`, rounded up at each step; `tot` is 0; `pow` is 1.**
