The code snippet `tot += a` increments the variable `tot` by the value of `a`. Given the initial state, `tot` is not explicitly defined, but based on the context, it seems `tot` should be initialized to `0` before this operation (as it's common practice when such a variable is used in accumulation). Since `tot` is not given a specific value, we'll assume it starts at `0` for the purpose of this task.

After executing `tot += a`, the new value of `tot` will be `a` (since `tot` was initially `0`). The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `pow`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is `0`, `k` is `input_k`, `L` is `[1]`, `pow` is `2`, `tot` is `a`**.
