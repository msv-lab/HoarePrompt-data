To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variable `n` and appends values to the list `L`.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
- In each iteration:
  - `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which means `m` is the ceiling of `n / 2`.
  - `n` is then reduced by `m`, effectively halving it (rounding down if necessary).
  - `m` is appended to the list `L`.

### Termination Condition:
- The loop terminates when `n` becomes 0.

### Final Output State:
- When `n` reaches 0, the loop stops.
- The list `L` will contain a series of values that represent the successive halvings of the original `n`, rounded up at each step.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's take an example where `n = 10`:
1. First iteration: `m = (10 + 1) // 2 = 5`, `n = 10 - 5 = 5`, `L = [5]`
2. Second iteration: `m = (5 + 1) // 2 = 3`, `n = 5 - 3 = 2`, `L = [5, 3]`
3. Third iteration: `m = (2 + 1) // 2 = 2`, `n = 2 - 2 = 0`, `L = [5, 3, 2]`

The loop terminates after 3 iterations because `n` becomes 0.

### General Case:
For any initial value of `n`, the loop will continue until `n` is reduced to 0. The list `L` will contain the sequence of values that represent the successive halvings of `n`, rounded up at each step.

### Final Output State Description:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- `n` becomes 0 after the loop finishes.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- `L` contains the sequence of values that represent the successive halvings of the original `n`, rounded up at each step.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` is 0; `k` is an input integer; `L` is a list containing the sequence of values that represent the successive halvings of the original `n`, rounded up at each step.**
