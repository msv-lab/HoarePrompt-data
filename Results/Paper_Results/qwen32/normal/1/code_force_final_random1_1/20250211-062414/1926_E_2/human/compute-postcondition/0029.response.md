Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is [1], `pow` is 4, `tot` is `tot` (before increment) + `a`. The loop cannot execute another iteration as there are no more elements in `L`.**

Natural Language: The value of `pow` has been doubled from 2 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged. The loop condition still holds that there are no more elements in `L` to process.
