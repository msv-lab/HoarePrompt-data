Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it precomputes the sums of digit replacements. It calculates the cumulative sum of the digit replacements from 1 to 200,000 and stores them in the list `A`. When a test case value `n` is provided, it simply returns `A[n-1]`, which is incorrect because it assumes that the cumulative sum up to `n` is the answer for each test case.

However, the problem requires the sum of the digit replacements for each individual test case, not the cumulative sum up to `n`. For example, if the test case is `n=12`, the program should calculate the sum of the digit replacements for numbers from 1 to 12, which is `51` as per the example. But the current implementation would return the cumulative sum up to 12, which includes the sums of all previous numbers up to 12, leading to incorrect results for larger values of `n`.

To fix this, the program should compute the sum of digit replacements for each test case individually without relying on precomputed cumulative sums. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def sum_of_digit_replacements(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total_sum += sum_of_digits(i)
    return total_sum

def sum_of_digits(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num / 10)
    return a

for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(sum_of_digit_replacements(n))
```

This corrected version calculates the sum of digit replacements for each test case separately, ensuring the correct result for every potential case.
