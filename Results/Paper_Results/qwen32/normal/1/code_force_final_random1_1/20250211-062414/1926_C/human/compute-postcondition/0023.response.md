To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for j in str(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The objects in the loop head are `j` and `i`. The variable `j` is an individual character from the string representation of `i`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `i` can be converted to a non-empty string.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `N` is 200001
- `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to `n` except `pd[n + 2]` which is now `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1]`
- `i` is `n + 2`

Since `i` is initially set to `n + 2`, and given that `n` is at least 1, `i` will be at least 3. Converting `i` to a string will always result in a non-empty string (since `i` is a positive integer). Therefore, no adjustment to `i` is necessary for the loop to execute.

However, since the question asks us to specify the state and we are only allowed to adjust the objects in the loop head (`j` and `i`), and since `i` already satisfies the condition, we don't need to change anything about `i`.

Thus, the state remains as provided, with the understanding that `i` is already set to a value that allows the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to `n` except `pd[n + 2]` which is now `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1]`, `i` is `n + 2`**
