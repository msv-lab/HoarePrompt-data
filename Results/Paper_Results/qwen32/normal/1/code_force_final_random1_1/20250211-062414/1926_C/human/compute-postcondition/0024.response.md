The given code snippet modifies the value of `pd[i]` by adding the integer value of `j` to it. Here, `i` is `n + 2`. The initial state specifies that `pd[i]` was previously `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1]`.

After executing the line `pd[i] += int(j)`, the new value of `pd[i]` (which is `pd[n + 2]`) will be `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1] + int(j)`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `N`) remain unchanged. The list `pd` is updated only at index `n + 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to `n` except `pd[n + 2]` which is now `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1] + int(j)`, `i` is `n + 2`**.
