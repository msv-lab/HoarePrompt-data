The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations left in the loop. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` does not affect the loop condition, we only need to adjust `t` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to 200000.**
