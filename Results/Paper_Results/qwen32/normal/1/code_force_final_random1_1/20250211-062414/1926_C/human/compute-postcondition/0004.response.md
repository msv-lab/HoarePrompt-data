To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `num != 0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `num` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `num` < 2 · 10^5 (with the last digit removed).
- `a` is the last digit of the original `num`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must not be zero. Therefore, we need to ensure that `num` is a positive integer.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `num` is not zero.
2. **Current State**: After the previous iteration, `num` has the last digit removed. If `num` was a single-digit number initially, removing the last digit would result in `num` becoming 0.
3. **Adjustment Needed**: To ensure the loop executes one more time, `num` must be a multi-digit number after the last digit is removed. This means `num` must have been at least a two-digit number before the last digit was removed.

### Conclusion:
To guarantee that the loop can execute one more time, `num` should be a positive integer after the last digit is removed. This implies that `num` must have been at least a two-digit number initially.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` < 2 · 10^5 (with the last digit removed), `a` is the last digit of the original `num`**.

This ensures that `num` is not zero and the loop can proceed with another iteration.
