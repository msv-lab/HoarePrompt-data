To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop:

```python
while num != 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop continues as long as `num` is not equal to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is described as "an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` < 2 · 10^4 (with the last digit removed)," and `a` is the last digit of the original `num`.

Since the loop condition is `num != 0`, the loop will continue to execute as long as `num` is not zero. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `num` should still be a non-zero integer.

Given that the last digit has already been removed from `num`, we need to ensure that `num` still retains a value that is not zero. Since the problem specifies that `num` is "with the last digit removed," we can infer that `num` was originally a number with at least two digits (otherwise, removing the last digit would result in `num` being zero).

Thus, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `num` should be a non-zero integer after the last digit has been removed. The variable `a` (the last digit of the original `num`) does not affect the loop condition directly and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state does not need to be modified further to ensure the loop executes one more time, as long as `num` remains non-zero after the last digit has been removed.

State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` < 2 · 10^4 (with the last digit removed), `a` is the last digit of the original `num`**
