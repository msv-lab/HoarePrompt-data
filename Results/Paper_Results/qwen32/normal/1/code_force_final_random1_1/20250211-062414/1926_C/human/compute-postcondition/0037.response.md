The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations left to perform. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of each iteration, `t` is implicitly decremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the input integer
- `N` is 200001
- `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to 200000

Since the loop head does not include `t`, `n`, `N`, or `pd`, we cannot directly adjust these variables based on the loop head alone. However, we know that `t` needs to be decremented for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `t` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t - 1 ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to 200000**
