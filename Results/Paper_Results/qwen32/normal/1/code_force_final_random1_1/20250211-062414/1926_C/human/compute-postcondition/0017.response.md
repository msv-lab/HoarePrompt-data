The code snippet `pd[i] += int(j)` modifies the element at index `i` of the list `pd` by adding the integer value of `j` to it. Given that `i` is 2, `pd[2]` will be updated to its current value plus `int(j)`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `N` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where the first `t` elements are the cumulative sums of the digits of their respective indices up to `i`, with `pd[1]` increased by `int(j)` and `pd[2]` increased by `int(j)`, `i` is 2**.
