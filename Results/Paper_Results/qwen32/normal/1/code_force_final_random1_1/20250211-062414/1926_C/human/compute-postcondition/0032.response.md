The code snippet provided is:

```python
n = int(input())
```

This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `N`, and `pd`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `N` is 200001
- `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to 200000

After executing the code snippet, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The values of `t`, `N`, and `pd` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to 200000.**
