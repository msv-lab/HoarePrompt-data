The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which iterates over the characters in the string representation of `i`. Since `i` is currently 2, the loop has already completed its iteration over `str(2)`, which is just the single character '2'. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the outer loop (if there is one), we need to consider what happens when `i` is incremented.

However, since the task specifies only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head (`j` in this case), and since the loop over `str(i)` has finished, there is no next iteration of this inner loop to prepare for. Instead, we should consider the state right before the next potential iteration of an outer loop that might increment `i`.

Given the information, it seems like we are preparing for the next value of `i`. But since the task strictly asks to adjust only the loop head variables, and there are no more iterations of the current loop over `str(i)`, we can infer that we are effectively done with this specific loop.

If we were to hypothetically consider the next value of `i` for completeness (even though it's not part of adjusting the loop head), `i` would be incremented to 3, and the loop would then iterate over `str(3)`, which is '3'.

But sticking strictly to the task requirements:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where the first `t` elements are the cumulative sums of the digits of their respective indices up to `i`, with `pd[1]` increased by `int(j)` and `pd[2]` increased by `int(j)`, `i` is 2** (no change needed for the loop head variable `j` as the loop is complete)

Since the loop over `str(i)` is complete and there are no further iterations of this loop to prepare for, the state remains the same with respect to the loop head variable `j`.
