To determine what will be printed by the `print(pd[n])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the components involved:

1. **Variables and Initial State:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\). This variable seems to indicate the number of test cases but is not directly relevant to the current print statement.
   - `n`: The input integer for which we need to find the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - `N`: A constant integer with the value 200001.
   - `pd`: A list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to 200000.

2. **Understanding `pd` List:**
   - The list `pd` is precomputed such that `pd[i]` contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`.
   - For example, `pd[1]` would be the sum of the digits of the number 1, `pd[2]` would be the sum of the digits of the numbers 1 and 2, and so on up to `pd[200000]`.

3. **What Will Be Printed:**
   - The `print(pd[n])` statement will print the value stored in `pd[n]`.
   - Since `pd[n]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`, this is exactly what will be printed.

Given that `n` is the input integer and `pd` is already computed as described, the output will be the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **pd[n] (where pd[n] is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to n)**
