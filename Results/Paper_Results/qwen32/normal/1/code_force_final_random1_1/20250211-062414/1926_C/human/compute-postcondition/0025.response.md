To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for j in str(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `j` and `i`. Given the current state, `i` is `n + 2`, and `j` is being iterated over each character in the string representation of `i`.

Let's break down the current state and how it should change for the next iteration:

- **`t`**: This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted.
- **`n`**: This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted.
- **`N`**: This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted.
- **`pd`**: This list is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted directly. However, its value might be affected by the loop body, but we are not modifying it here.
- **`i`**: This variable is part of the loop head. Since `i` is `n + 2` and we are iterating over each digit of `i`, `i` itself does not change during the loop. Instead, `j` changes as it iterates over each digit of `i`.
- **`j`**: This variable is part of the loop head. It represents each digit of `i` as a string.

Given that `i` is `n + 2`, let's assume `n + 2` is a multi-digit number. The loop iterates over each digit of `i`. After the first iteration, `j` will be the second digit of `i`, and so on.

For example, if `i` is `123`, the iterations would be:
1. First iteration: `j` is `'1'`
2. Second iteration: `j` is `'2'`
3. Third iteration: `j` is `'3'`

Since we are asked to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what `j` would be next.

Let's assume the current value of `j` is the first digit of `i`. For the next iteration, `j` will be the next digit in the string representation of `i`.

### Example Calculation:
If `i` is `123` and the current `j` is `'1'`, then for the next iteration, `j` will be `'2'`.

### General Case:
If `i` is `n + 2` and `j` is currently the k-th digit of `i`, then for the next iteration, `j` will be the (k+1)-th digit of `i`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` or the current position of `j` within `str(i)`, we can generalize that `j` will be the next digit in the string representation of `i`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to `n` except `pd[n + 2]` which is now `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1] + int(j)`, `i` is `n + 2`, `j` is the next digit in the string representation of `i`**
