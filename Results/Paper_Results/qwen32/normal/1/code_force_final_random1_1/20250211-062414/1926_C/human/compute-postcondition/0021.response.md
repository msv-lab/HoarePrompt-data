The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `n + 2`. The value of `N` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `i` is `n + 2`**
