### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the program and the original assessment to ensure everything aligns with the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Vladislav writes integers from 1 to \( n \).
- Each integer is replaced by the sum of its digits.
- We need to find the sum of these new numbers for multiple test cases.

#### Program Code Recap:
1. **Precomputation**:
   - An array `A` is initialized to store cumulative sums.
   - A variable `sum` is initialized to 0.
   - The program iterates through numbers from 1 to 200,000.
   - For each number, it calculates the sum of its digits using `func_1`.
   - It adds this digit sum to `sum` and appends the current `sum` to `A`.

2. **Handling Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
   - It prints the value at index `n-1` of the precomputed list `A`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the sum of the digits of a given integer `num`.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- `func_1(num)` correctly computes the sum of the digits of `num`.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Precomputation**:
   - The program precomputes the cumulative sum of digit sums for all integers from 1 to 200,000.
   - `A[i]` should contain the sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to \( i+1 \).
   - However, there is a logical error here. The program appends the cumulative sum to `A` after processing each number, meaning `A[i]` will actually contain the sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to \( i \), not \( i+1 \).

2. **Handling Input**:
   - For each test case, the program looks up the precomputed result in `A[n-1]`.
   - This lookup is indeed O(1), making it efficient.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given integer.
   - It uses a simple loop that runs in O(d) time, where d is the number of digits in the number.

#### Correctness Check:
- The issue lies in the precomputation step. The program should append the cumulative sum to `A` after processing each number, but due to the way the indices are handled, `A[n-1]` will correctly give the sum of the digit sums from 1 to \( n \) because of how Python lists are indexed.
- Therefore, despite the potential confusion in the indexing, the program does correctly compute and store the required cumulative sums.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly precomputes the required values and handles each test case efficiently. The logical flow and indexing in the program work out correctly given the problem constraints.

Final: **True**
