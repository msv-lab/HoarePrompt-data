To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `num != 0`.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `num` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is 0

The loop will execute if `num` is not equal to 0. Since `num` is already specified to be within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5, it is guaranteed that `num` is not equal to 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `num`.

The variable `a` is not part of the loop condition and thus does not need to be adjusted.

Since the loop condition is already satisfied with the given state, we can simply repeat the program state right before the loop.

State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is 0**
