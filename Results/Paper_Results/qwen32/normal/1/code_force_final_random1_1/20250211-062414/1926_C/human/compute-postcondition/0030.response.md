To understand the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `pd` list.

### Loop Analysis

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = N-1` (where `N` is 200001). For each iteration `i`:
1. It adds the value of `pd[i-1]` to `pd[i]`.
2. It then adds the sum of the digits of `i` to `pd[i]`.

This means that `pd[i]` will accumulate the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`.

### Final Output State

After the loop completes all its iterations, `pd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to 200000 will contain the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`.

### Detailed Explanation

- `pd[1]` will be the sum of the digits of 1.
- `pd[2]` will be `pd[1] +` the sum of the digits of 2.
- `pd[3]` will be `pd[2] +` the sum of the digits of 3.
- And so on...

By the end of the loop, `pd[200000]` will be the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to 200000.

### Conclusion

The final output state of the `pd` list will be such that each element `pd[i]` contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to 200000.**
