The code snippet provided resets `array2` to an empty list. This affects only the variable `array2`. All other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `n` is `feat[0]`; `array2` is `[]`; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a`, `test_cases` retain their initial states; `b` is `feat[-1]`; `f` is `feat[1]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
