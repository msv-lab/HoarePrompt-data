The code reads a line of input, splits it into components based on spaces, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `feat`. The variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, and `i` is used as a loop variable within the list comprehension but does not persist outside of it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
