To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because `range(1, n)` generates numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.

The variable `i` is the loop variable and its initial value is set automatically by the `range` function; therefore, we do not need to adjust `i` directly. However, we need to ensure that `n` is set correctly so that the loop can run.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1
- `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `n` is `feat[0]`
- `f` is `feat[1]`
- `a` is `feat[2]`
- `b` is `feat[-1]`
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line
- `array2` is an empty list

The only variable in the loop head that we need to adjust is `n`. To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is an empty list**
