Postcondition: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 0, `array2` is `[]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a`, `test_cases` retain their initial states, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `i` is 0. Additionally, the first element of `arr` is less than `b / a`.**
