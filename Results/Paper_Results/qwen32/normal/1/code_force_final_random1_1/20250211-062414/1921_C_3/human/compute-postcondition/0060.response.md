Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input where `feat[0]` (which is `n`) must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line, `i` is 0. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains one element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.**
