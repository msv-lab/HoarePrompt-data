To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and how it modifies the `array2` based on the given conditions.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).
- For each iteration `i`, it checks if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i-1]` is less than `b / a`.
- If the condition is met, it appends `(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a` to `array2`.

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have taken on every value from `1` to `n-1`. The `array2` will contain all the computed values where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i-1] < b / a` was satisfied during these iterations.

### Description in Natural Language:
The final output state is reached when the loop has gone through all elements from `arr[1]` to `arr[n-1]` and checked the specified condition for each pair of consecutive elements. If the condition `arr[i] - arr[i-1] < b / a` holds true for any pair, the result `(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a` is added to `array2`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop finishes.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `i` is `n`. `array2` contains all elements `(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a` where `arr[i] - arr[i-1] < b / a` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n-1`.**
