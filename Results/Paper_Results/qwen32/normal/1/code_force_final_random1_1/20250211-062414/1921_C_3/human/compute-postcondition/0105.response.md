To determine what will be printed by the `print('Yes')` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the conditions:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `feat`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `n`: The first element of `feat` (`feat[0]`) and must be greater than 0.
   - `b`: The last element of `feat` (`feat[-1]`).
   - `f`: The second element of `feat` (`feat[1]`).

2. **List `arr`:**
   - `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.

3. **List `array2`:**
   - `array2` is constructed based on the following rules:
     - For the first element: If `arr[0] < b / a`, then `array2[0] = arr[0] * a`.
     - For subsequent elements (`i > 0`): If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2[i] = (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.

4. **Condition:**
   - The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`.

Given these conditions, the `print('Yes')` statement will execute only if the specified condition holds true. Since the exact values of `feat`, `arr`, `a`, and `test_cases` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `array2` or the sum involved in the condition. However, based on the problem statement, we know that if the condition is satisfied, the code will print "Yes".

Thus, the output of the `print('Yes')` statement, given that the condition is met, is:

Output: **Yes**
