The code assigns the second element of the list `feat` to the variable `f`. Therefore, `f` now holds the value `feat[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`.**
