The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `arr`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, or `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line.**
