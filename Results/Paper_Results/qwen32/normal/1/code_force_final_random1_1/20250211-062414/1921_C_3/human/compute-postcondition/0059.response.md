Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's determine the output state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1
- `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input where `feat[0]` (which is `n`) must be greater than 1
- `f` is `feat[1]`
- `a` is `feat[2]`
- `b` is `feat[-1]`
- `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line
- `i` is 0
- `array2` is an empty list
- `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`

### Code Execution:
```python
array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
```

### Impact on Variables:
- `array2` was initially an empty list. After the code execution, it will contain one element, which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.

### Output State:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `test_cases` remains greater than or equal to 1
- `feat` remains a new list of integers obtained from the input where `feat[0]` (which is `n`) must be greater than 1
- `f` remains `feat[1]`
- `a` remains `feat[2]`
- `b` remains `feat[-1]`
- `arr` remains a new list of integers obtained from the new input line
- `i` remains 0
- `array2` now contains one element, which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input where `feat[0]` (which is `n`) must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line, `i` is 0, `array2` contains one element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`**.
