Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same length; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input line; `b` is a list of integers derived from the input line; `new` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the corresponding element in `a` (or `b`), except `new[i]` which is `max(a[i], b[i])`; `new2` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the corresponding element in `a` (or `b`), except `new2[i]` which is `min(a[i], b[i])`; `i` is not equal to the length of `a` (or `b`) and `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `i` is increased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
