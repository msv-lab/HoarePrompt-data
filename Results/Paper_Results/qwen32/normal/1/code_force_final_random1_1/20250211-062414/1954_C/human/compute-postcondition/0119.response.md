Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. It then generates two new numbers: one where each digit is the maximum of the corresponding digits of `x` and `y`, and another where each digit is the minimum of the corresponding digits of `x` and `y`. The function prints these two new numbers for each test case.**
