Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and having the same length; `b` is a list of integers derived from the latest input line; `a` is a list of integers derived from the latest input line; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`; the number of remaining iterations is one less than before; `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is initialized to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
