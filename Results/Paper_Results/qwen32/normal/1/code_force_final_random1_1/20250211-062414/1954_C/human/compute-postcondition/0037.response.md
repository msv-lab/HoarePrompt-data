To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed on the variables:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `x` and `y` are integers with lengths up to 100 digits, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `x` and `y` have the same length.
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers derived from the digits of `x` and `y` respectively.
- `new` is a list where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements from `a` and `b`.
- `new2` is a list where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements from `a` and `b`.
- `i` is the length of `a` (or `b`).

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
```

This line of code performs the following operations:
1. It iterates over each element `x` in the list `new`.
2. Converts each element `x` to a string.
3. Joins all these string representations together into a single string.
4. Prints the resulting string.

### Explanation of `new`:
- `new` is constructed such that each element `new[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- Since `a` and `b` are derived from the digits of `x` and `y` respectively, `new[i]` is essentially the minimum digit at position `i` between `x` and `y`.

### Final Output:
The output will be a string formed by concatenating the minimum digits at each position between `x` and `y`.

### Example:
If `x = 345` and `y = 256`, then:
- `a = [3, 4, 5]`
- `b = [2, 5, 6]`
- `new = [min(3, 2), min(4, 5), min(5, 6)] = [2, 4, 5]`
- The printed string will be `'245'`.

### General Case:
For any `x` and `y` of the same length, the printed string will be the concatenation of the minimum digits at each corresponding position.

Thus, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **the string formed by concatenating the minimum digits at each corresponding position between `x` and `y`**.
