Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and having the same length; `b` is a list of integers derived from the input line; `a` is a list of integers derived from the latest input line. If `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, then `new` is a list of integers where `new[j]` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` where `0 ≤ j < len(a)` and `new2` is a list of integers where `new2[j]` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` where `0 ≤ j < len(a)`. If `i` is equal to `len(a)`, then `new` and `new2` remain as lists of `None` values except `new[j]` and `new2[j]` which are `min(a[j], b[j])` and `max(a[j], b[j])` respectively for all `j` where `0 ≤ j < i`.**
