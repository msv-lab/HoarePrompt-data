The code snippet reads a line of input, converts each character to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `b`. This means `b` will be a list of integers derived from the input line, similar to how `a` was described in the initial state.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `b`, which is newly introduced and populated with the integers from the input line. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same length; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input line; `b` is a list of integers derived from the input line.**
