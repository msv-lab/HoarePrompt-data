The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged; `x` remains unchanged; `y` remains unchanged; `b` remains unchanged; `a` remains unchanged; `new` has `min(a[len(a) - 1], b[len(a) - 1])` at index `len(a) - 1` and `None` for other indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond; `new2` has `max(a[len(a) - 1], b[len(a) - 1])` at index `len(a) - 1`; `i` is now `len(a)`**.
