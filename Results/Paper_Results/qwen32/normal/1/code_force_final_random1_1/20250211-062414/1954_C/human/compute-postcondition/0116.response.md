Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`, `x`, `y`, `b`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- `new` is constructed such that for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`, `new[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`. For indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond that point, `new[i]` is `None`.
- `new2` is constructed similarly but with `min(a[i], b[i])` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`. For indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond that point, `new2[i]` is `None`.
- The loop continues until `i` reaches the length of `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet joins the string representations of each element in the `new2` list into a single string.
- Since `new2[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])` only for indices where `a[i] == b[i]`, and `None` otherwise, the resulting string will contain the minimum values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for matching elements, followed by empty strings for `None` values (since `str(None)` is `'None'`).

### Output Description:
- The output will be a concatenated string of the minimum values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for indices where `a[i] == b[i]`, with `'None'` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond that point.

### Example:
If `a = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `b = [1, 3, 3, 5]`, then:
- `new2` would be `[1, None, 3, None]` because:
  - At index 0, `a[0] == b[0]`, so `new2[0] = min(1, 1) = 1`.
  - At index 1, `a[1] != b[1]`, so `new2[1] = None`.
  - At index 2, `a[2] == b[2]`, so `new2[2] = min(3, 3) = 3`.
  - At index 3, `a[3] != b[3]`, so `new2[3] = None`.

Thus, the printed output would be `'1None3None'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1None3None (where each element is the minimum of corresponding elements in `a` and `b` if they are equal, otherwise `None`)**

However, since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can generalize the output as follows:

Output: **a series of minimum values of corresponding elements in `a` and `b` where they are equal, followed by 'None' for other positions**
