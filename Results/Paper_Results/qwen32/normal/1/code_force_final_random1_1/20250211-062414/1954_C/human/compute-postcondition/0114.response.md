Postcondition: **`t`, `x`, `y`, `b`, and `a` remain unchanged. `new` has `max(a[i], b[i])` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]` and `None` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond that point. `new2` has `min(a[i], b[i])` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]` and `None` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]` or beyond that point. If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the number of remaining iterations is non-zero, indicating that the loop has not completed all its iterations. If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, the number of remaining iterations is zero, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.**
