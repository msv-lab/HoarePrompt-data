Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `a` is a list where the first `n - 2` elements are 0 and at least one of the last two elements is not 0, and `stop` remains unchanged (either True or False).**
