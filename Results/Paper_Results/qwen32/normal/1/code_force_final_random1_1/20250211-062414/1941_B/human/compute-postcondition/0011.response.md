In this task, the initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, and `b`), but the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will always be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
