In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the input value `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable whose value we don't plan to use) and the result of `int(input())`.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of `t` because it directly determines how many times the loop will run. The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted as its value is not used within the loop.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
2. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. However, we should clarify that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to run.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should confirm that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

Since the problem specifies that `t` is already within the valid range, no further adjustments are necessary beyond confirming this condition.
