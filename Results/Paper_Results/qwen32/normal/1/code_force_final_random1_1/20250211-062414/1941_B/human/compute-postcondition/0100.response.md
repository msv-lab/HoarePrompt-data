Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is at least 3, `stop` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains incremented by 1, `n` retains its value of being at least 3, and `stop` remains True. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without altering the values of these variables.
