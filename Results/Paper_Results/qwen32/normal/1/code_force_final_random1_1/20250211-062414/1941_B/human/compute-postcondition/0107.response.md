The given initial state provides values for the variables `i` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Values**: 
   - `i` is 4.
   - `n` is at least 6.

2. **Examine the Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is `print('NO')`.
   - This statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

3. **Determine the Output**:
   - Since the `print` statement does not reference any variables (`i` or `n`), their values do not influence the output.
   - The output is exactly the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **NO**
