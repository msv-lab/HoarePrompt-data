Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the length of the newly input list `a`, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `stop` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 2):
    if a[i] < 0:
        print('NO')
        stop = True
        break
    opNum = a[i]
    a[i] -= opNum
    a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
    a[i + 2] -= opNum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[i]` is `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`, and `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - opNum`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `stop` remains False unless `a[i] < 0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is at least 3, `a[i]` is 0, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - opNum`, `stop` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 4, `n` is at least 6, `a[4]` is 0, `a[5]` retains its previous value, `a[6]` retains its previous value, `opNum` is 0, `stop` retains its previous value (either True or False).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
