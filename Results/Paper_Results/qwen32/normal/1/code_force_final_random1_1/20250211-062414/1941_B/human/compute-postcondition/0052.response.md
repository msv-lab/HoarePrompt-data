Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `opNum` is assigned the value of `a[i]`; If the current element `a[i]` is less than 0, `stop` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains False.**

Natural Language: The variable `opNum` is now assigned the value of the current element `a[i]`. All other variables retain their previous states and conditions.
