Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the requirements of the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem states that we need to determine if we can make all elements of the array zero using a specific operation. The operation allows us to choose an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq n-1 \)) and perform the following changes:
- Decrease \( a_{i-1} \) by 1.
- Decrease \( a_i \) by 2.
- Decrease \( a_{i+1} \) by 1.

The key observation here is that the operation affects three consecutive elements, and the total change in the sum of the array due to this operation is -4. Therefore, for it to be possible to make all elements zero, the sum of the array must be divisible by 4.

However, the given program does not check the sum of the array. Instead, it checks two conditions related to the parity of the first and last elements and their neighbors:
- If the first element is odd and the second element is not exactly 2 more than the first, it prints "NO".
- If the last element is odd and the second-to-last element is not exactly 2 more than the last, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Evaluation of the Given Program
The logic implemented in the program is flawed because:
1. It does not consider the sum of the array, which is a crucial factor in determining whether the array can be reduced to all zeros.
2. The conditions checked by the program do not cover all necessary cases for the feasibility of reducing the array to all zeros. For instance, the program might incorrectly return "YES" for arrays where the sum is not divisible by 4, or it might incorrectly return "NO" for arrays where the sum is divisible by 4 but does not meet the specific parity conditions.

### Conclusion
Given the above points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as per the requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
