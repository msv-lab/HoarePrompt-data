The given code snippet modifies the value of `a[i + 2]` by subtracting `opNum` from it. Since `opNum` is 0, the value of `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input with `a[i]` now equal to 0 and `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` remain unchanged; `opNum` is 0; `stop` is True if `a[i]` was less than 0, otherwise `stop` remains False; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `a[i + 2]` did not change because `opNum` is 0. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
