The code assigns the value of `a[i]` to the variable `opNum`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `stop` remain unchanged. Since `i` is initially `i + 1`, it retains that value. The variable `opNum` now holds the value of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `stop` is True if `a[i]` is less than 0, `opNum` is `a[i]`**.
