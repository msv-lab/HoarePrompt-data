The given initial state does not provide any specific details about the variables `i` and `n` other than `i` being incremented by 1 and `n` being at least 3. However, these details do not affect the execution of the `print('NO')` statement because it directly prints the string `'NO'` without referencing any variables.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
