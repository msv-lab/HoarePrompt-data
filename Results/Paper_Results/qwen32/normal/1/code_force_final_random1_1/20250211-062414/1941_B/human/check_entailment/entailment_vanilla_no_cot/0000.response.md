Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. The logic in the program checks only the first and last elements of the array, which is insufficient to solve the problem.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that the array can be reduced to all zeros by repeatedly applying the given operation. A key insight is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the elements plays a crucial role. Specifically, the operation changes the parity of three consecutive elements in a specific way, and we need to ensure that the initial configuration allows for such reductions.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the first element can be reduced to zero
        if a[0] % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check the rest of the array
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            if a[i] < a[i-1] + 2:
                print('NO')
                break
            a[i+1] += (a[i] - (a[i-1] + 2)) // 2
            a[i] = (a[i-1] + 2) % 2
        
        # Finally, check the last two elements
        if a[n-2] % 2 == 1 or a[n-1] != a[n-2] + 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This solution iterates through the array and ensures that each element can be reduced according to the rules, adjusting subsequent elements as necessary. If at any point it's impossible to reduce an element, it outputs 'NO'. If it successfully processes the entire array, it outputs 'YES'.
