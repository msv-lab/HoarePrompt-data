The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or `stop`. It only terminates the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block is mentioned in the context, the `break` statement has no effect on the variables.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `stop` is True**.
