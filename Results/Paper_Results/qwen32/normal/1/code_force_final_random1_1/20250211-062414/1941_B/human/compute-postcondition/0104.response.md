The code snippet `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` modifies the value at index `i + 1` of the list `a` by subtracting `2 * opNum` from it.

Given the Initial State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, meaning `i` has some value that was previously incremented.
- `n` is at least 3.
- `a[i]` is 0.
- `stop` remains unchanged.

The code does not affect `i`, `n`, `a[i]`, or `stop`. It only affects `a[i + 1]`.

Since `a[i + 1]` is being decremented by `2 * opNum`, its new value will be its original value minus `2 * opNum`. The original value of `a[i + 1]` is not specified, so we denote it as `a[i + 1]` before the operation. After the operation, `a[i + 1]` becomes `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is at least 3, `a[i]` is 0, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`, `stop` remains unchanged.**
