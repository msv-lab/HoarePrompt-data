Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_j satisfies 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = int(input())
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1
        ] + 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is an input integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the first element of `b` is odd and the second element of `b` is not equal to the first element plus 2, or the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element of `b` is not equal to the last element plus 2, then the condition of the if statement holds. Otherwise, either `b[0]` is even, or `b[0]` is odd and `b[1]` is equal to `b[0] + 2`. Additionally, either `b[-1]` is even, or `b[-1]` is odd and `b[-2]` is equal to `b[-1] + 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is an input integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the first element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second element minus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second-to-last element minus 2, then the if block's postcondition holds. Otherwise, the else block's postcondition holds, which is identical to the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is the input integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the first element of `b` is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2, then the if block's postcondition holds. Otherwise, the else block's postcondition holds, which means the values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
