Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the list can be reduced to zeros by performing specific operations. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
