Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a list `a` and a list `a` of `n` integers where each element `a_j` is between 0 and 10^9. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the elements of the list `a`.**
