Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `stop` is True, and the current element `a[i]` is less than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
