The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of any other variables or conditions in the initial state. The initial state provides information about several variables (`_`, `t`, `numTest`, `n`, `a`, `stop`, and `a[i]`), but none of these affect the content of the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
