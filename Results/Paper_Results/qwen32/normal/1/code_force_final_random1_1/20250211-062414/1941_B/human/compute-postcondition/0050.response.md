Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `stop` is True; the current element `a[i]` is less than 0; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of any variables. Thus, the values of `_`, `t`, `numTest`, `n`, `a`, `stop`, and the condition about `a[i]` remain unchanged.
