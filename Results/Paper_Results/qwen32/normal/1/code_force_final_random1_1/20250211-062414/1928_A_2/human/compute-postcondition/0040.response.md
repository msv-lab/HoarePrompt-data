Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `a1` is calculated as `a // 2`.
- `a2` is also calculated as `a // 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'`. The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `_`, `a1`, and `a2` are defined but are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `_`, `a1`, and `a2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
