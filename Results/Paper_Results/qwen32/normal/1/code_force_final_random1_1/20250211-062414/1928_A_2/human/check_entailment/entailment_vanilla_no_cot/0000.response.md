Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

The problem requires us to determine if a rectangle of size `a x b` can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then reassembled into a different rectangle (where rotations are considered the same).

Here are the key points to consider:

1. If either dimension of the rectangle is 1, it cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles of integer dimensions.
2. If both dimensions are even, the rectangle can always be cut into two smaller rectangles and reassembled into a different rectangle.
3. If one dimension is odd and the other is even, the rectangle can also be cut and reassembled into a different rectangle.
4. If both dimensions are odd, the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles and reassembled into a different rectangle.

Now, let's look at the given code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

- The first condition checks if both dimensions are even. If true, it prints 'yes', which is correct.
- The second condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` seems incorrect and does not make sense in the context of the problem. It seems like an attempt to check if the dimensions are equal, but it is not written correctly.
- The third condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` will always be true for non-zero differences, which is not the correct logic to determine if the rectangle can be reassembled into a different one.
- The `else` clause will handle the case where both dimensions are odd, printing 'no', which is correct.

Given the above analysis, the logic in the program is flawed, particularly in the second and third conditions. The correct approach should be:

- If either dimension is 1, print 'no'.
- If both dimensions are even, print 'yes'.
- If one dimension is odd and the other is even, print 'yes'.
- If both dimensions are odd, print 'no'.

Thus, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
