### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) and wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. He then wants to rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle. The key point is that the new rectangle must have different dimensions from the original rectangle, considering rotations as identical.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Even Dimension Case**: If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle. For example:
   - If \(a\) is even, cut the rectangle into two \(a/2 \times b\) rectangles.
   - If \(b\) is even, cut the rectangle into two \(a \times b/2\) rectangles.
   
2. **Odd Dimension Case**: If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because any cut will result in two smaller rectangles with at least one odd dimension, and rearranging them will not yield a new rectangle with different dimensions.

#### Analysis of the Given Program:
The provided program has several issues in its logic:

1. **Condition 1**: `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` This condition checks if both dimensions are even. According to our observations, this should actually be `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:` to correctly identify cases where either dimension is even.

2. **Condition 2**: `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` This condition is syntactically incorrect and logically flawed. It seems like an attempt to check if \(a\) and \(b\) are equal, but the tuple syntax is incorrect and doesn't serve the intended purpose.

3. **Condition 3**: `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` This condition is always true for any pair of integers \(a\) and \(b\) that are not equal, which is incorrect. The correct condition should be checking if either dimension is even.

4. **Else Condition**: `else: print('no')` This condition is reached when none of the previous conditions are met, which is incorrect based on our observations.

#### Correct Implementation:
The correct implementation should check if either dimension is even and print 'yes' if true, otherwise print 'no'. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

func()
```

#### Evaluation Based on Annotations:
The annotated code states that the function processes `t` test cases and prints 'yes' if either both `a` and `b` are even or if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd. However, the logic for checking the absolute difference is incorrect and doesn't align with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis and the correct logic, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed conditions and incorrect handling of the test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
