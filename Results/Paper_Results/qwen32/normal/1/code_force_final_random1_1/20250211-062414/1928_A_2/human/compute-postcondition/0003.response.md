The `print('yes')` statement in the provided Python code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions derived from the initial state. It simply outputs the string `'yes'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state provides information about `t`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'yes'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **yes**
