Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \). He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle using these two smaller rectangles. Two rectangles are considered the same if one can be rotated to match the other.

### Key Observations:
1. **Cutting Possibilities:**
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle along the length (`a`), he gets two rectangles of size \((a/2) \times b\).
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle along the width (`b`), he gets two rectangles of size \(a \times (b/2)\).

2. **Forming New Rectangles:**
   - To form a new rectangle, the dimensions of the two smaller rectangles must allow them to be rearranged into a rectangle with different dimensions.
   - This means that the total area remains the same (\(a \times b\)), but the dimensions of the new rectangle must be different from \(a \times b\).

3. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If both `a` and `b` are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of equal size and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - If either `a` or `b` is odd, Bob can still form a new rectangle unless the difference between `a` and `b` is such that the resulting smaller rectangles cannot be rearranged into a new rectangle with different dimensions.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
Let's break down the logic in the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Issues in the Code:

1. **Condition for Even `a` and `b`:**
   - The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` is correct. If both dimensions are even, Bob can always form a new rectangle.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Odd Dimensions:**
   - The condition `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is incorrect. This condition seems to be checking something unrelated to the problem requirements.
   - The condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is also incorrect. The expression `(a - b) % 2` will always be either `0` or `1`, and the condition will always evaluate to `True` for non-zero differences, which is not the intended logic.

3. **Missing Logic:**
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where one dimension is odd and the other is even, or when both dimensions are odd.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

- If both `a` and `b` are even, print "Yes".
- If one of `a` or `b` is odd and the other is even, print "Yes".
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, print "No".

### Revised Code:
Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original code is incorrect due to the flawed conditions and missing logic. The revised code correctly handles all cases as per the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
