Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `_` is incremented by 1. If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are each set to `a // 2`. If `b` is even, `b1` and `b2` are each set to `b // 2`. If `a` is odd, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` remain unset. If `a1` is not equal to `b` and `b1` is not equal to `a`, no additional changes occur.**
