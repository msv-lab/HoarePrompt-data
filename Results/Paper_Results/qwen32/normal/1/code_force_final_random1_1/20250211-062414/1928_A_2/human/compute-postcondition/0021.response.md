Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1. Regardless of whether `(a - b) % 2 > 0` or `(a - b) % 2 < 0`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition since the if and else parts do not alter the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or the increment operation on `i`.**
