The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables outside of the loop context. Since there is no loop explicitly mentioned in the given context, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `_`, `a1`, or `a2`. Therefore, none of these variables are altered.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `_` is incremented by 1; `a1` is `a // 2`; `a2` is `a // 2`.**
