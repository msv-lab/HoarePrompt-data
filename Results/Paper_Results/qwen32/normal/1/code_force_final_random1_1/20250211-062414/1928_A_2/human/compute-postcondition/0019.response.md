Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'yes'`. There are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement that depend on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. Therefore, the output will always be the string `'yes'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **yes**
