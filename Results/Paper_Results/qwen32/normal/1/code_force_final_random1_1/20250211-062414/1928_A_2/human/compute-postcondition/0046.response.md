The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `_`, `b1`, or `b2` are altered.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `_` is incremented by 1; `b1` is `b // 2`; `b2` is `b // 2`.**
