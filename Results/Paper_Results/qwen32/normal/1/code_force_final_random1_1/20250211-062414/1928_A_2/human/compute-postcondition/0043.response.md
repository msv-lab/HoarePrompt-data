Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `_` is incremented by 1. If `a` is even, `a1` is set to `a // 2` and `a2` is set to `a // 2`. If `a1` is not equal to `b`, the program continues as specified in the if part. Otherwise, there is no change from the initial state since there is no else part.**
