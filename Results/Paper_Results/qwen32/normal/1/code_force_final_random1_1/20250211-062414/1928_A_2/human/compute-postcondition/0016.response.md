The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, and `i` is incremented by 1. However, the code does not affect `t` or `i`. The values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1.**
In natural language: The value of `t` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` are now the integers read from the input, and `i` has been incremented by 1.
