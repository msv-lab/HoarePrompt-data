The given code snippet only modifies the value of the variable `one`. It toggles the boolean value of `one` using the `not` operator.

Given that the initial state specifies `one` is `False`, after executing `one = not one`, the value of `one` will become `True`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5; `t` is an integer equal to 1; the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed; `x` is an integer; `y` is an integer; `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node a to lists of nodes b, and `lst[z]` contains at least one element except the last element which was popped; `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node b to lists of nodes a; `z` is an input integer; `tmp` is now the last element of the list `lst[z]` before it was popped; `one` is True; `lst[tmp]` contains at least one element**.
