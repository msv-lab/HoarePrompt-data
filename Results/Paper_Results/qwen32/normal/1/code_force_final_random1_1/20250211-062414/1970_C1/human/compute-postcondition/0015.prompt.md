Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(x - 1):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    lst[a].append(b)
    rev[b].append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree, the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed, `x` is at least 2, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory where `lst[a]` includes `b` as its last element, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, and `rev[b]` now includes `a` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree, the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed, `x` is at least 2, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory where `lst[a]` includes `b` as its last element, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `rev[b]` includes `a` as its last element.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
