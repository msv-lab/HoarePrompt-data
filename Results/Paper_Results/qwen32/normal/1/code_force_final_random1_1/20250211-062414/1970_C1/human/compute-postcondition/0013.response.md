The given code snippet appends the integer `b` to the list associated with the key `a` in the `defaultdict` named `lst`. This means that if there was already a list of elements under the key `a`, `b` will be added to the end of that list. If there was no list associated with `a` before, a new list containing just `b` will be created.

The other variables (`n`, `t`, the edges `u` and `v`, the initial node `u_1`, `x`, `y`, and `rev`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree, the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed, `x` is at least 1, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory where `lst[a]` includes `b` as its last element, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `rev[b]` includes `a` as its last element, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
