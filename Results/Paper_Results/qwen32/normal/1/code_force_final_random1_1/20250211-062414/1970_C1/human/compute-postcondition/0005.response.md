The code snippet `lst[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list associated with the key `a` in the `defaultdict` named `lst`. This means that the list stored under the key `a` in `lst` will now include the value `b` as its last element.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree, the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed, `x` is at least 2, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory where `lst[a]` includes `b` as its last element, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
