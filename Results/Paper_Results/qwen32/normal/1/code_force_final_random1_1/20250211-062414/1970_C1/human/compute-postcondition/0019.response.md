To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement:

```python
while lst[tmp] != []:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute if `lst[tmp]` is not an empty list. Therefore, we need to ensure that `lst[tmp]` contains at least one element.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5
- `t` is an integer equal to 1
- The next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree
- The last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed
- `x` is an integer
- `y` is an integer
- `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node a to lists of nodes b
- `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node b to lists of nodes a
- `z` is an input integer
- `tmp` is equal to `z`
- `one` is True

We need to make sure that `lst[tmp]` is not empty. Since `tmp` is equal to `z`, we need to ensure that `lst[z]` is not empty.

### Steps to Adjust the State:
1. Ensure that `z` is a key in `lst`.
2. Ensure that `lst[z]` contains at least one element.

### Adjusted State:
Since `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, if `z` is not already a key in `lst`, accessing `lst[z]` will automatically create an empty list. To ensure that `lst[z]` is not empty, we need to add at least one element to `lst[z]`.

Let's assume `z` is a valid node in the graph (since `z` is an input integer and `lst` is constructed based on the edges provided). We can add any valid node `b` to `lst[z]`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree, the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node a to lists of nodes b and `lst[z]` contains at least one element, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node b to lists of nodes a, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `z`, `one` is True**

For simplicity, let's assume we add a single element `b` to `lst[z]`:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree, the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node a to lists of nodes b and `lst[z]` contains at least one element (e.g., `lst[z] = [b]`), `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node b to lists of nodes a, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `z`, `one` is True**

Since the exact value of `b` doesn't matter for the loop condition, we can leave it as a placeholder.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree, the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node a to lists of nodes b and `lst[z]` contains at least one element, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node b to lists of nodes a, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `z`, `one` is True**
