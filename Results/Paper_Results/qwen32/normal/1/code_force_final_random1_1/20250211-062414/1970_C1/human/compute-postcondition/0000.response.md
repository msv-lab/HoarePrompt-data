The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This operation does not affect the initial state of `n`, `t`, the edges of the tree, or the initial node `u_1` where the stone is placed.

After executing the code snippet, the new values of `x` and `y` will be the two integers read from the input. Since the exact values of these integers are not specified in the initial state, we denote them as `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed. `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input.**
