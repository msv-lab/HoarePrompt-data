Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `True`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except for elements corresponding to initially unvisited nodes which are `1`; `tot` is the value it held after the last DFS call; `bipartite` is the result of the last DFS call; `ok` is `False`; `i` is `n`.**
