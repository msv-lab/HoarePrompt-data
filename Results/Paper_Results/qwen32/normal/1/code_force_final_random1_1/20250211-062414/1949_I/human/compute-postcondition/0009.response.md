The code snippet reads three integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]`. Given the initial state, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of `None` values with length `n`, except for `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` which are integers. After the code executes, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` will be replaced with the newly read integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `x[i]` which is the first integer from the input; `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `y[i]` which is the second integer from the input; `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `r[i]` which is the third integer from the input; `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
