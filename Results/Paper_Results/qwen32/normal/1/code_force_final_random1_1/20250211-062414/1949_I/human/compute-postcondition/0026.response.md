Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` with the element at index `i` set to `True` if `visited[i]` was initially `False`, otherwise unchanged; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[i]` is `1`; `tot` is 0; `bipartite` is `True`; `ok` is `False`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Explanation: The only change made by the code is that `tot` is set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values or states.
