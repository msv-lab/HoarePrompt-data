The code snippet `r = [None] * n` reassigns the list `r` to a new list containing `n` `None` values, effectively discarding the original list of radii.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False`; `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to `None`.**
