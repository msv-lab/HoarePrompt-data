Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` with at least one element at index `i` set to `False`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[i]` which is now `1`; `tot` is 0; `bipartite` is `True`; `ok` is `False`. The current element at index `i` in `visited` is `False`.**

Natural Language: The value at index `i` in the `coef` list has been updated to `1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
