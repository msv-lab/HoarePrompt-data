Precondition: **i is an integer representing the index of a disk, where 0 <= i < n. x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i] and y[i] represent the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and r[i] represents the radius of the i-th disk. visited is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited in the DFS. coef is a list of integers used to assign coefficients during the DFS to determine if the graph formed by the disks is bipartite. tot is a variable used to accumulate the total of the coefficients. bipartite is a boolean variable indicating whether the graph is bipartite. n is the total number of disks.**
