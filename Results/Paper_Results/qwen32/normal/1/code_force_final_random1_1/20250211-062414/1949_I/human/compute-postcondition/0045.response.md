Functionality: **The function reads input values for the number of disks and their respective centers and radii. It then determines if there exists at least one connected component of disks that forms a bipartite graph and has a non-zero total value (`tot`). If such a component exists, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function modifies the `visited` list to mark disks as processed and the `coef` list to store coefficients related to the disks.**
