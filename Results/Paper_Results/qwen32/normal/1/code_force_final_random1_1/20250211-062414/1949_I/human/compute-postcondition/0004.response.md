The code snippet `visited = [False] * n` reassigns the `visited` list to a new list where each element is `False`. This means that the previous values in the `visited` list (which were all `False`) remain unchanged, but the list object itself is reassigned.

Since the other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `coef`) are not modified by this line of code, their states remain as they were initially described.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`; `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to `None`.**
