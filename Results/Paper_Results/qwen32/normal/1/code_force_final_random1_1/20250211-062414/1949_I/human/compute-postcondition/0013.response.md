The code snippet initializes a variable `tot` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, or `coef`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `tot` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `tot` is 0.**
