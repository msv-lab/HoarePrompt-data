Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters but operates on global variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`. It processes `n` disks defined by their centers (`x[i]`, `y[i]`) and radii `r[i]`, and modifies the `visited` list to mark disks as processed and the `coef` list to store some coefficients related to the disks. The function does not return any value directly but modifies the global state of `visited` and `coef`.**
