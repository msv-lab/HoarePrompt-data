To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information:

- `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `p_4` are integers between 0 and 200. These variables do not directly affect the `print(cnt)` statement.
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. This variable also does not directly affect the `print(cnt)` statement.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input. The exact values of these integers are not specified.
- `cnt` is calculated as the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the list `a`.

Given this information, `cnt` is computed based on the values in the list `a`. Since the specific values of the elements in `a` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, we can describe `cnt` precisely in terms of the list `a`.

The formula for `cnt` is:
\[ \text{cnt} = \sum_{x \in a} \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor \]

This means that for each element `x` in the list `a`, we take the floor of `x / 2` and sum these values to get `cnt`.

Thus, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of math.floor(x / 2) for all elements x in the list a)**
