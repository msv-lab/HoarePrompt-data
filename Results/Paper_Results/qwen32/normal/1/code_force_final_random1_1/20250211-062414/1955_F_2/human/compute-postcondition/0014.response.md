The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`. Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the loop's continuation condition, we only need to consider how the loop's continuation condition might change.

Given that the loop runs for a number of iterations specified by user input, the state of the loop doesn't directly depend on the variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p_4`, `t`, `a`, or `cnt`. However, since the loop's continuation is based on the number of iterations specified by the user input, we need to ensure that the input allows for another iteration.

Since the loop runs for a fixed number of iterations determined by the user input, and assuming the user input hasn't changed, the loop will continue as long as there are remaining iterations. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p_4`, `t`, `a`, or `cnt` to start the next iteration of the loop.

However, if we consider the state just before the loop starts the next iteration, it would be the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, except that the loop counter (which is represented by `_` but not explicitly tracked in the given state) would have incremented internally by the loop mechanism.

State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_4` is an integer between 0 and 200, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the list `a`**
