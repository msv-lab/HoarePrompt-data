To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the line `cnt += math.floor(x / 2)` on the existing variables. Here, `cnt` is initially set based on the first three elements of the list `a`. The value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, so we'll keep it as `x` for the calculation.

The operation `math.floor(x / 2)` computes the floor division of `x` by 2, which means it divides `x` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest integer. This value is then added to `cnt`.

Given that the initial value of `cnt` is either 0 or 1, the new value of `cnt` will be `cnt + math.floor(x / 2)`. Since `math.floor(x / 2)` is an integer, the new value of `cnt` will also be an integer.

The other variables (`p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p_4`, `t`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_4` is an integer between 0 and 200, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input and must have at least one element, `cnt` is `cnt + math.floor(x / 2)`**.
