The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which iterates over the list `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `x` and how it relates to the list `a`.

Given:
- `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `p_4` are integers between 0 and 200 (these do not affect the loop directly).
- `t` is greater than or equal to 1 (this does not affect the loop directly).
- `a` is a list of integers with at least one element.
- `x` is the next element in the list `a`.
- `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)` (this does not affect the loop head directly).

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the current element being processed from the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in the list `a` to assign to `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `x` is now the next element in the list `a`.

State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_4` is an integer between 0 and 200, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `x` is the next element in the list `a` after the previous `x`, `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`**.

To clarify, if `x` was the first element in the list `a` during the previous iteration, then in the current state, `x` should be the second element in the list `a`. If `x` was the second element, then `x` should be the third element, and so on. The exact value of `x` depends on its position in the list `a` from the previous iteration. However, we know that `a` must have at least two elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_4` is an integer between 0 and 200, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `x` is the next element in the list `a` after the previous `x`**.
