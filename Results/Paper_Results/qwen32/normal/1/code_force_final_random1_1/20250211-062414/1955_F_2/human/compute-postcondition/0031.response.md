Postcondition: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_4` is an integer between 0 and 200, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input. If the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, `cnt` is 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.**
