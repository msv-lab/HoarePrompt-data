The code snippet reassigns the variable `a` to a new list of integers obtained from the user input. This means the original list `a` is replaced with whatever integers the user inputs, split by spaces.

Since the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p_4`, `t`, and `cnt` are not modified by this code snippet, they retain their initial values. The only change is to the variable `a`.

Output State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 200, `p_4` is an integer between 0 and 200, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cnt` is the initial value of `cnt` (either 0 or 1 based on the condition) plus the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all `x` in the old `a`.**
