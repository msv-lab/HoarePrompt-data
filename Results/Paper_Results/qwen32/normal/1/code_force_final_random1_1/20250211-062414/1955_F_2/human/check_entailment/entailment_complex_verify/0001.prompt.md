You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of four integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) (where \( 0 \leq p_i \leq 200 \)) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. There are \( t \) test cases where \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \).
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: A series of `t` lines, each line being the result of the computation `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2` for the corresponding input values.
#Overall this is what the function does:For each test case consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence, the function calculates and prints a value based on the parity of the first three counts and the total count of numbers, effectively determining a derived count related to these inputs.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

The game revolves around the bitwise XOR of the numbers in the sequence. Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers is non-zero, otherwise, Bob wins. Eve removes one number at a time, and we need to find the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve plays optimally.

#### Key Observations:
1. **XOR Properties**: 
   - XOR of two identical numbers is `0`.
   - XOR of a number with `0` is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the XOR of all numbers is zero.

3. **Optimal Strategy for Eve**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR zero as often as possible by removing numbers strategically.

#### Strategy Breakdown:
- If there is an odd count of numbers that contribute to a non-zero XOR (i.e., 1s, 3s), Bob can win when all such numbers are removed, leaving an even count of them which results in a zero XOR.
- If there are an even count of 1s and 3s, Bob can win when pairs of these numbers are removed, leaving an even count of them which results in a zero XOR.
- Numbers 2 and 4 do not affect the parity of the XOR since `2 XOR 2 = 0` and `4 XOR 4 = 0`.

### Solution Analysis:

The provided solution attempts to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

#### Code Explanation:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

- `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`: This line attempts to convert the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s into even numbers by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2. However, this operation does not correctly reflect the logic needed for determining Bob's wins.
- `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)`: This checks if all three counts (1s, 2s, 3s) are odd. If they are, it adds 1 to the result, indicating that Bob can win once initially.
- `sum(p) // 2`: This calculates half the total count of numbers, which does not correctly represent the optimal strategy for maximizing Bob's wins.

### Correctness Evaluation:

The provided solution does not accurately implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Specifically:
- It incorrectly modifies the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s.
- It does not correctly account for the optimal removal strategy by Eve.

Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
