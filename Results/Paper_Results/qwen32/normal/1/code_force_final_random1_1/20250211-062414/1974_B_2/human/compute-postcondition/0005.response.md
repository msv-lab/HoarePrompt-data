The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `j` was initially `len(unique_chars) - 1`, after decrementing, `j` becomes `len(unique_chars) - 2`.

Output State: **`s` is a list of strings where each occurrence of `char` has been replaced with `unique_chars[j]`; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found in the strings of `s`; `i` is 0; `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2`.**
