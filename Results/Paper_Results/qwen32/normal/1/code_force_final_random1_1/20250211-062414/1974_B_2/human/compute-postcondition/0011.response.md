The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`, which iterates over the elements of the list `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `char` to reflect the next element in the list `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a list of strings.
- `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found in the strings of `s`.
- `i` is either 0 or 1.
- `j` is either `len(unique_chars) - 1` or `len(unique_chars) - 2`.

Since the loop iterates over `char` in `s`, we need to determine the next value of `char` based on the current position in `s`. However, the problem does not specify the exact position of `char` in `s` at the end of the previous iteration. For the sake of this task, let's assume that `char` was the last character of the last string in `s` during the previous iteration.

To proceed with the next iteration, `char` should be the first character of the next string in `s` if there are more strings left, or the next character in the current string if it hasn't reached the end of that string yet.

However, since the exact structure of `s` (whether it's a list of single-character strings or multi-character strings) and the exact position of `char` within `s` are not specified, we can only assume that `char` will take the next value in the sequence of characters from `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`s` is a list of strings, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found in the strings of `s`, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is either `len(unique_chars) - 1` or `len(unique_chars) - 2`, `char` is the next character in the list `s`**.

If we assume that `char` was the last character of the last string in `s` during the previous iteration, then `char` would be the first character of the first string in `s` during the first iteration, or the next character in the sequence otherwise. Since the exact position is not specified, we simply denote it as "the next character in the list `s`".

State: **`s` is a list of strings, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found in the strings of `s`, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is either `len(unique_chars) - 1` or `len(unique_chars) - 2`, `char` is the next character in the list `s`**.
