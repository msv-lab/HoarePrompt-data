Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
  - `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
  - `i` is incremented by 1.

- **Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  print('no')
  ```

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'no'`. It does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
