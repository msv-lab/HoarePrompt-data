In this task, the initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `_`, but the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. Instead, it directly prints the string `'No'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is described as an integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
2. The variables `a` and `b` are integers that are read from the input.
3. The variable `_` is incremented by 1, but this operation does not affect the `print` statement.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('No')
```
It simply outputs the string `'No'` without referencing any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, or `_`.

Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables provided in the initial state.

Output: **No**
