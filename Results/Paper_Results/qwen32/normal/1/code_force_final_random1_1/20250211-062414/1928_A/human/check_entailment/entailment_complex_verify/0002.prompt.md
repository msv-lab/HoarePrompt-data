You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2

    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            if a % 2 == 0:
                a1, a2 = a // 2, a // 2
                if a1 != b:

                b1, b2 = b // 2, b // 2

        else:

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and the variables `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` do not retain specific values across iterations. The loop counter `_` is equal to `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If one of them is even, it further checks if splitting the even number into two equal parts results in a part that is not equal to the other number. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it directly prints 'No'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`. He wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. After cutting, he wants to use these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle that is different from the original rectangle (ignoring rotations).

### Key Observations:
1. If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always make a cut that results in two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
   - If `a` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles. These can be rearranged into a `b x a` rectangle if `a/2 != b`.
   - If `b` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles. These can be rearranged into an `a x b` rectangle if `b/2 != a`.

2. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then any cut will result in two rectangles with at least one dimension being `1`, and these cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the logic in the given program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            if a % 2 == 0:
                (a1, a2) = (a // 2, a // 2)
                if a1 != b:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            if b % 2 == 0:
                (b1, b2) = (b // 2, b // 2)
                if b1 != a:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            print('No')
        else:
            print('No')
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. The program correctly checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
2. If `a` is even, it calculates `a1 = a // 2` and checks if `a1 != b`. If true, it prints 'Yes'.
3. If `b` is even, it calculates `b1 = b // 2` and checks if `b1 != a`. If true, it prints 'Yes'.
4. If neither condition is met (either both dimensions are odd or the rearrangement does not yield a different rectangle), it prints 'No'.

### Issues in the Program:
The program has a logical flaw:
- It only checks one of the conditions when both `a` and `b` are even. If `a` is even and `a1 == b`, it should still check if `b` is even and `b1 != a` before concluding with 'No'. The same applies vice versa.

### Corrected Logic:
- If `a` is even and `a1 != b`, print 'Yes'.
- If `b` is even and `b1 != a`, print 'Yes'.
- If neither condition is met, print 'No'.

### Conclusion:
The current program does not cover all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to check the second condition when the first one does not satisfy the requirement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
