Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob wants to cut a rectangle of size `a x b` into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle. The key points are:

- If `a == b`, the rectangle is a square, and cutting it will result in two identical rectangles, which can only form the same square.
- If `a != b`, there are two possible ways to cut the rectangle:
  - Cut parallel to the side of length `a`, resulting in two rectangles of size `a x (b/2)` if `b` is even.
  - Cut parallel to the side of length `b`, resulting in two rectangles of size `(a/2) x b` if `a` is even.
- After cutting, Bob can form a new rectangle if the dimensions of the new rectangle are different from the original `a x b`.

### Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:
- If both `a` and `b` are even, Bob can always form a new rectangle by cutting along either dimension.
- If either `a` or `b` is odd, Bob can only form a new rectangle if the difference between `a` and `b` is not zero (i.e., `a != b`).

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the logic in the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Condition for Even `a` and `b`:**
   - The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` correctly identifies when both dimensions are even, and it prints 'yes'.
   
2. **Condition for Odd `a` or `b`:**
   - The condition `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is incorrect. It seems like an attempt to check if `a == b`, but the syntax is wrong and does not achieve the intended logic.
   - The condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is also incorrect. The expression `(a - b) % 2` will never be greater than 0 and less than 0 simultaneously. Instead, it should check if `a != b`.
   
3. **Final Condition:**
   - The final `else` clause incorrectly prints 'no' for cases where `a == b`, which is not correct.

### Correct Logic:
- If `a == b`, print 'no'.
- If `a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`, print 'yes'.
- Otherwise, print 'no'.

### Conclusion:
The provided program has logical errors and does not correctly implement the conditions needed to solve the problem.

**Correctness: False**
