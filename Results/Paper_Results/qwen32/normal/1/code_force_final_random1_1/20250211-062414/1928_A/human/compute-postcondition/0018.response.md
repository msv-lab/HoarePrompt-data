In this task, we need to determine what will be printed by the `print('no')` statement given the initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Analysis:
The `print('no')` statement is straightforward. It prints the string `'no'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. It simply outputs the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
