Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `_` is incremented by 1. If `b` is even, `b1` is set to `b // 2` and `b2` is set to `b // 2`. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, there are no further changes. If `b` is odd, there are no changes to `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, or `_`.**
