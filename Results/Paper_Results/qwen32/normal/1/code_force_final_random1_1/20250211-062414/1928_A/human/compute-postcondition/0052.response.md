To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions and how it processes each test case.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, two integers `a` and `b` are read.
- The loop checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
  - If `a` is even, it splits `a` into two halves (`a1` and `a2`), and checks if `a1` (or `a2`) is not equal to `b`.
  - If `b` is even, it splits `b` into two halves (`b1` and `b2`), and checks if `b1` (or `b2`) is not equal to `a`.
  - If either condition is met, it prints "Yes".
  - If neither `a` nor `b` is even, or if `a1` equals `b` and `b1` equals `a`, it prints "No".

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the loop will have processed all `t` test cases. The variables `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` will not retain their values between iterations because they are reassigned in each iteration. The only variable that retains its value across iterations is `_`, which simply counts the number of iterations.

### Conclusion:
The final output state after all iterations is determined by the printed results for each test case. Since the problem asks for the output state in terms of variable values, we focus on the fact that the loop counter `_` will be equal to `t` after all iterations, and all other variables (`a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`) will be undefined or reset at the start of each iteration.

Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and the variables `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` do not retain specific values across iterations. The loop counter `_` is equal to `t`.**

In simpler terms, after all the test cases are processed, the loop will have completed `t` iterations, and the intermediate variables used within the loop will not hold any specific values outside of their respective iterations.
