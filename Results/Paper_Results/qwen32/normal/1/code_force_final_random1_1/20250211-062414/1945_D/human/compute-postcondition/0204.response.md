Given the initial conditions, we know that `y` is 1. Therefore, we need to evaluate the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`:

- `a_values[y - 1]` is `a_values[0]`, which is 10.
- `b_values[y]` is `b_values[1]`, which is 25.
- `a_values[y]` is `a_values[1]`, which is 20.

So, the condition becomes `10 + 25 <= 20`, which simplifies to `35 <= 20`. This condition is false. Therefore, according to the initial state, `custo` is 110.

Next, the code increments `custo` by `a_values[y]`, which is `a_values[1]` or 20. So, `custo` changes from 110 to 130.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`custo` is 130, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `custos` includes 120, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged, and `y` is 1.**
