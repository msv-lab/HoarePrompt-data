Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `custos` includes the current value of `custo`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings from the latest input, `b` is a list of substrings from the input.
Code of the loop:
for y in b:
    b_values.append(int(y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `custos` includes the current value of `custo`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of `y`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings from the latest input, `b` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 1 element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `custos` includes the current value of `custo`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of `y` and the newly appended integer value of `y`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings from the latest input, `b` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 2 elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `custos` includes the current value of `custo`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of `y` and two newly appended integer values of `y`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings from the latest input, `b` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `y` is the next element in the list `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
