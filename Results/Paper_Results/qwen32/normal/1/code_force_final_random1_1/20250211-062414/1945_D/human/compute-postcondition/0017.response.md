The code snippet adds the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`. Since `total` was initially 0, its new value will be `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer such that `na_frente` ≥ 0, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
