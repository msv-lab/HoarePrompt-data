The given code snippet adds the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to `total`. 

Given that `total` was initially 0, after executing the line `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `total` will be equal to `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer such that `na_frente` ≥ 0, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `total` is `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is 10, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, the cost to change at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the cost to pass at position `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`).**
