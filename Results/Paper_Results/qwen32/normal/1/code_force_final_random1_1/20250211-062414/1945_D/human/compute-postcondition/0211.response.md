In the given initial state, the list `custos` is defined as `[120, 140]`. However, the print statement in the code snippet is `print(c)`, where the variable `c` is not mentioned in the initial state. This means that the variable `c` is either not defined or not provided in the context.

Since there is no information about the variable `c`, it is impossible to determine what will be printed without additional context. Therefore, based on the provided information, the output cannot be precisely determined.

However, if we assume that this is an oversight and the intention was to print `custos`, then the output would be the list `[120, 140]`.

Given the current information, the most accurate response is:

Output: **NameError: name 'c' is not defined** (since `c` is not defined in the given context)
