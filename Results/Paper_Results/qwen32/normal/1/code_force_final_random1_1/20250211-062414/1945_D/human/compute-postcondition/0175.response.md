The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y` relative to `max_p` and `num_fila`.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.

Given the loop condition `range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)`, the loop will continue as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p`.

So, if `y` is currently `max_p`, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, `y` must be greater than `max_p` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`y` is `max_p + 1`, `num_fila` remains unchanged, `max_p` remains unchanged**
