To determine what will be printed by the `print(best)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `c` is set to 1.
- `na_frente` is the first integer read from input minus 1.
- `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 2.
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `custo_pra_passar_b` is another list of integers read from input.
- `v` is initialized to -1.
- `total` is the accumulated minimum cost from `na_frente` to 0.
- `best` is the minimum cost encountered when switching up to `pos_final`.

Given this setup, the variable `best` holds the minimum cost encountered when switching up to `pos_final`. However, without specific values for `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `best`.

Thus, the output will be described in terms of the variable `best` and its context.

Output: **best (where best is the minimum cost encountered when switching up to pos_final)**
