Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input minus 1 (must be non-negative), `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is 0. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]`. Additionally, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` if `best` was previously greater than this value. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[0] < custo_pra_passar_b[0]`; otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.**
