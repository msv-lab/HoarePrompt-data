Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Kirill is at the end of a queue of `n` people.
- He wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
- To swap positions with someone at position `i`, Kirill pays `a_i` coins.
- Additionally, for each person between the swapped positions, Kirill pays `b_k` coins.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach one of the first `m` positions.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of:
- `n`: Number of people in the queue (excluding Kirill).
- `m`: Maximum allowable final position of Kirill.
- `a`: List of costs to swap with each person.
- `b`: List of additional costs to pass through each person.

The program iterates from the last person in the queue to the first, calculating the minimum cost to move Kirill to one of the first `m` positions.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The program seems to have a flawed logic for calculating the total cost. Specifically, the decision to add `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to the total cost does not align with the problem description. The problem requires paying `a_i` to swap with the person at position `i` and `b_k` for each person between the swapped positions, but the program does not correctly account for these costs.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `m = 1` (Kirill needs to be at the front of the queue).

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 1
7 3 6
4 3 8
```
- Kirill starts at position 4.
- He wants to be at position 1.
- The costs to swap with each person are `[7, 3, 6]`.
- The additional costs to pass through each person are `[4, 3, 8]`.

The optimal solution would be to swap with the second person (cost `3`) and then pay `4` to pass through the first person, resulting in a total cost of `7`. However, the provided program may not calculate this correctly due to its flawed logic.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly calculates the total cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions. It does not properly account for the costs associated with swapping and passing through people in the queue. This results in incorrect outputs for certain test cases.
