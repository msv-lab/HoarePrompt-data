The code increments the variable `custo` by the value of `a_values[y]`. Given the initial state, `y` is 1, and `a_values[1 - 1]` is `a_values[0]`, which is 10. Therefore, `custo` will be updated from 120 to 130.

The other variables remain unchanged. Here's the output state:

Output State: **`custo` is 130, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `custos` includes 120, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `y` is 1, and the sum of `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`.**
