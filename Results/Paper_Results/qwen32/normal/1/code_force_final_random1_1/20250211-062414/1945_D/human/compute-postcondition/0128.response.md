Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input minus 1 (must be non-negative), `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is 0. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`, then `total` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`. Otherwise, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.**
