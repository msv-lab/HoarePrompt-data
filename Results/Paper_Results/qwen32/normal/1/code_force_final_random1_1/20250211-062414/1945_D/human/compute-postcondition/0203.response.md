Postcondition: **`custo` is 145, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `custos` includes 120, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged, and `y` is 1 if the initial `y` was 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the initial `y` was not 1, these variables retain their initial values.**
