Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `total` is incremented by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The values of other variables remain the same as described in the initial state.
