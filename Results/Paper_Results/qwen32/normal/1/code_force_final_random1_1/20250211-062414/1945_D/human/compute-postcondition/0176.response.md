Output State: **`y` is `max_p + 1`, `num_fila` remains unchanged, `max_p` remains unchanged, `custo` is increased by `a_values[max_p + 1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `custo` is updated by adding the value of `a_values` at index `y`, which is `max_p + 1`. The values of `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p` remain the same.
