The given code snippet increments the variable `total` by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Given that `v` is initially 0, `total` will be incremented by the first element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `cases` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `c` remains 2.
- `na_frente` remains the first integer read from input minus 1 (must be non-negative).
- `pos_final` remains the second integer read from input minus 1.
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains a list of integers read from input.
- `custo_pra_passar_b` remains a new list of integers read from input.
- `v` remains 0.
- `total` is now `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`.
- `best` remains unchanged unless the condition `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` was true before the increment, in which case it would have been updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` before this line of code was executed.

Since the task specifies to only update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code, and `best` is only updated conditionally before the given line, we do not include it in the output state unless explicitly stated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input minus 1 (must be non-negative), `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is 0, `total` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`.**
