The code snippet adds the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`. Given that `v` is initialized to 0, the value added to `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.

Therefore, the updated value of `total` is the original value of `total` plus `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input minus 1 (must be non-negative), `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is 0, `total` is the original value of `total` plus `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.**
