To determine what will be printed by the `print(best)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (This represents the number of test cases).
- `cases`: Greater than or equal to 1 (This likely represents the current test case number).
- `c`: Set to 2 (This could represent a constant or a specific configuration value).
- `na_frente`: The first integer read from input minus 1 (This represents an index or position in the list).
- `pos_final`: The second integer read from input minus 1 (This also represents an index or position in the list).
- `custo_pra_trocar_a`: A list of integers read from input (These are costs associated with changing something).
- `custo_pra_passar_b`: Another list of integers read from input (These are costs associated with passing through something).
- `v`: Initialized to -1 (This is used as an index in the following calculations).
- `total`: Accumulated cost based on the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` down to 0.
- `best`: The minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` where `v` was less than or equal to `pos_final`.

### Calculation Process:
1. **Initialization**: `v` starts at -1.
2. **Accumulating Total Cost**:
   - For each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0, the code calculates the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
   - This minimum cost is added to `total`.
3. **Calculating Best Value**:
   - For each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0, if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, the code calculates `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
   - The smallest value obtained from these calculations is stored in `best`.

### Final Output:
The `print(best)` statement will output the smallest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` where `v` was less than or equal to `pos_final`.

Given the information, the precise value of `best` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Answer:
Output: **best (where best is the minimum value of total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] for all v where v is less than or equal to pos_final)**
