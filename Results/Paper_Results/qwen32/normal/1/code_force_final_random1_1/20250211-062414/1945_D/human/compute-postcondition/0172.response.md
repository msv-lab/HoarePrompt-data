The value of `custo` is incremented by the value of `a_values[y]`. The value of `y` is decremented by 1, `num_fila` remains unchanged, and `max_p` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is decremented by 1, `num_fila` remains unchanged, `max_p` remains unchanged, and `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`.

Output State: **`y` is decremented by 1, `num_fila` remains unchanged, `max_p` remains unchanged, `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`.**
