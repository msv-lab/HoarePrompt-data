Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer such that `na_frente` ≥ 0, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]`, `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]` or `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]` if it was smaller.**

In simpler terms, the value of `total` has been increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The value of `best` remains unchanged if it was already greater than the new `total`; otherwise, it is updated to the new `total`. All other variables retain their previous values.
