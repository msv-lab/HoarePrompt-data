To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which is `y` in this case.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop iterates over the range from `max_p - 1` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing `y` by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `y` was 1.
- `custo` is determined based on the condition involving `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]`.
- Other variables like `num_fila`, `max_p`, `custos`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Since `y` is currently 1, and the loop decrements `y` by 1 in each iteration, the loop would terminate after this iteration because the next value of `y` would be 0, which is outside the specified range (`max_p - 1` down to `1`).

Therefore, there is no next iteration for the loop to execute, and the state does not need to be adjusted further for another iteration.

However, if we were to hypothetically consider the state just before the loop terminates (which is essentially the same as the given state since there's no next iteration), it would be:

State: **`custo` is 155 if `y` is 1 and the sum of `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is 130. `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `custos` includes 120, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged, and `y` is 0** (but since `y` cannot be 0 in the next iteration, this state is not valid for another iteration).

Thus, the loop terminates after `y` is 1, and there is no next iteration to adjust the state for.
