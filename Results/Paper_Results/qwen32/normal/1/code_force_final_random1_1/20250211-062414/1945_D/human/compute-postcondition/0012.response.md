Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer such that `na_frente` ≥ 0, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `total` is 0, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

Explanation: The value of `best` is updated to be the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
