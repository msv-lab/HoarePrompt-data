Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer read from input minus 1, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is the accumulated minimum cost from `na_frente` to 0, `best` is the minimum cost encountered when switching up to `pos_final`.**

Natural Language: The value of `na_frente` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
