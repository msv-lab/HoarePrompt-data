Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer such that `na_frente` ≥ 0, `pos_final` is the second integer read from input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente - 1`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated by adding the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its previous value. If `best` is greater than the updated `total`, then `best` is updated to the updated `total`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is updated by adding the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its previous value.**
