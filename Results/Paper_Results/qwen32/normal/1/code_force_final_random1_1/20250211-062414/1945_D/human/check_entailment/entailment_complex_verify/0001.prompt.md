You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `na_frente` and `pos_final`, and two lists of integers `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum possible cost to reach `pos_final` from `na_frente` by either passing through elements in `custo_pra_passar_b` or swapping to elements in `custo_pra_trocar_a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:

Kirill is at the end of a queue of `n` people and wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue. He can swap places with any person in front of him, paying `a_j` coins to swap directly with the `j-th` person, and `b_k` coins to each person between his current position and the `j-th` person. The goal is to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions.

### Key Points:

- Kirill starts at position `n+1`.
- He can swap with any person `j` where `j < n+1`, paying `a_j` coins.
- For each person `k` between `j` and `n+1`, he must also pay `b_k` coins.
- He wants to be in one of the first `m` positions.

### Solution Analysis:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by iterating from the last person in the queue to the first, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` positions.

#### Key Steps in the Code:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read `n` (number of people in the queue), `m` (desired maximum position), and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Adjust Indices:**
   - Convert `n` and `m` to zero-based indices (`na_frente -= 1` and `pos_final -= 1`).

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - Initialize `total` to 0 (total cost incurred so far).
   - Initialize `best` to a large value (10^12, representing the best minimum cost found).

4. **Iterate Backwards:**
   - Loop from the last person in the queue to the first (`for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1)`).
   - If the current position `v` is within the first `m` positions (`if v <= pos_final`):
     - Update `best` if the current cost to swap to position `v` is less than the previously recorded best cost.
     - Add the smaller of `a[v]` and `b[v]` to `total`.
   - If the current position `v` is not within the first `m` positions:
     - Still add the smaller of `a[v]` and `b[v]` to `total` to account for potential future swaps.

5. **Output:**
   - Print the best minimum cost found for each test case.

### Issues in the Code:

The main issue with the provided code is the logic used to update the `total` cost. The code incorrectly adds the smaller of `a[v]` and `b[v]` to `total` for every position `v`. This approach does not correctly account for the fact that Kirill can only swap with one person at a time and must pay `b[k]` for each person between his current position and the person he swaps with.

#### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to use a priority queue (min-heap) to always consider the least costly swap available. The algorithm should:

1. Use a min-heap to keep track of the smallest `a[j]` values encountered so far.
2. Iterate through the queue from the last person to the first.
3. For each person, calculate the cost to swap to that position, considering the accumulated `b[k]` costs.
4. Update the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` positions.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. It incorrectly calculates the total cost and does not properly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem.
