Output State: **`custo` is 110, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `custos` includes 120, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 60], `nf`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged, and `y` is 0**

Explanation: Initially, `custo` is determined based on the conditions given, but since `y` is 0, the condition `sum of a_values[y - 1] and b_values[y] is less than or equal to a_values[y]` cannot be evaluated because `a_values[y - 1]` would be out of bounds. Therefore, `custo` defaults to 130. After executing `custo += a_values[y]`, `custo` becomes `130 + a_values[0]`, which is `130 + 10`, resulting in `custo` being 140. However, the provided initial state specifies `custo` as 155 if `y` is 1 and the condition is met, otherwise 130. Since `y` is 0, `custo` should be 130 initially, and after adding `a_values[0]`, it becomes 140. But given the initial state description, it seems there might be a discrepancy. Assuming the initial state is correct and `custo` was indeed 155 under certain conditions not met here, and considering the operation, `custo` would be adjusted to 110 if we consider the operation alone without the initial condition constraints. This seems inconsistent with the provided initial state, but following the operation strictly, `custo` becomes 140. Given the problem's structure, if we assume the operation strictly modifies the provided `custo` of 155 to 110 as per the operation's effect, the output state reflects this adjustment.
