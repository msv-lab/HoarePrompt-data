Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to verify the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array. The beauty can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]
because all intermediate terms cancel out.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case:
1. It reads the length of the array \( n \).
2. It reads the array elements.
3. It sorts the array.
4. It prints the difference between the last and the first element of the sorted array.

### Verification
The program correctly implements the logic derived from the problem analysis. By sorting the array, the smallest element becomes the first element and the largest element becomes the last element. The difference between these two elements gives the maximum possible beauty.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary accurately describes what the function does:
- It reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum integers in the list `a`.

### Conclusion
The program is correct as it computes the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

### Reasoning
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and then finding the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. This approach ensures that the beauty is maximized because the sorted order ensures the largest possible difference between the first and last elements, which is the sum of all positive differences between consecutive elements.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
