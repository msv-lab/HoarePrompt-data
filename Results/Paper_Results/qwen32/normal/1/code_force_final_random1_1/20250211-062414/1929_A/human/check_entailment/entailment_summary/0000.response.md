### Reasoning:

The goal of the problem is to maximize the "beauty" of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements when the array is arranged in some order. To maximize this sum, we want to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

However, the provided program does not calculate the sum of differences between consecutive elements after sorting. Instead, it simply calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted array (`a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`). This approach does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty because it only considers the difference between the largest and smallest elements, ignoring the intermediate differences.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should compute the sum of differences between each pair of consecutive elements after sorting the array. Here's how the correct approach would look:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        beauty = sum(a[i] - a[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)
```

Since the provided program does not implement this logic, it does not correctly solve the problem.

### Correctness: **False**
