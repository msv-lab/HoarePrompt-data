You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `ntest` is equal to `itest + 1`, indicating that all test cases have been processed; `itest` is equal to `ntest - 1`, representing the last iteration of the loop. The variables `n` and `a` hold the values from the last test case processed, with `a` being a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum integers in the list `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step:

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array. The beauty can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]
because all intermediate terms cancel out.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case:
1. It reads the length of the array \( n \).
2. It reads the array elements.
3. It sorts the array.
4. It prints the difference between the last and the first element of the sorted array.

### Verification
The program correctly implements the logic derived from the problem analysis. By sorting the array, the smallest element becomes the first element and the largest element becomes the last element. The difference between these two elements gives the maximum possible beauty.

### Conclusion
The program is correct as it computes the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

Correctness: **True**
