To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive). This variable does not affect the current print statement.
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). This represents the number of elements in the list `a`.
- `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
- `ntest` must be greater than 2. This variable does not affect the current print statement.
- `itest` is set to 2. This variable also does not affect the current print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
```

Here's what this statement does:
- `a[len(a) - 1]` refers to the last element of the sorted list `a`.
- `a[0]` refers to the first element of the sorted list `a`.

Since `a` is a sorted list, the smallest element is at index 0 (`a[0]`) and the largest element is at index `len(a) - 1` (`a[len(a) - 1]`). Therefore, the expression `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the list `a`.

Given that the exact values of the elements in `a` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the properties of the list `a`.

Output: **the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a` (where `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9)**
