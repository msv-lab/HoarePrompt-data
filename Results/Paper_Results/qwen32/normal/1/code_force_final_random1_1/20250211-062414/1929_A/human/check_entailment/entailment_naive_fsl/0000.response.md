Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program sorts the array and then prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which does not maximize the beauty as defined.

The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, we should arrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by alternating the largest and smallest remaining elements.

Here is an example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
100 54 80 43 90
```

**Expected Output:**
```
57
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To maximize the beauty, we can arrange the array as `[43, 100, 54, 90, 80]`. The beauty is calculated as:
(100 - 43) + (54 - 100) + (90 - 54) + (80 - 90) = 57.

However, the provided program will sort the array to `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` and output `100 - 43 = 57`, which happens to be correct for this specific case but is not guaranteed to be correct for all cases.

A counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 3 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To maximize the beauty, we can arrange the array as `[1, 4, 2, 3]`. The beauty is calculated as:
(4 - 1) + (2 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 4.

However, the provided program will sort the array to `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and output `4 - 1 = 3`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the maximum beauty for all possible inputs.
