To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation involved:

1. **Variables and their properties:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive).
   - `n`, `a`, `b`: Integers where `n` is between 1 and 100, and `a` and `b` are between 1 and 30 (inclusive).
   - `A`, `B`, `C`: Three integers read from the input.
     - `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`.
     - `A` is an odd integer.
   - `X`: Calculated as `A // 2`.

2. **Expression to evaluate:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `X * C + B`.

3. **Step-by-step calculation:**
   - Since `A` is an odd integer, `A // 2` will result in the integer part of half of `A`. For example, if `A` is 7, then `X = 7 // 2 = 3`.
   - The expression `X * C + B` uses the values of `X`, `C`, and `B` to compute the final result.
     - `X` is `A // 2`.
     - `C` is one of the integers read from the input.
     - `B` is another integer read from the input.

Given the above, the output of the print statement will be the result of the expression `X * C + B`, where `X` is `A // 2`.

Therefore, the final output can be described as follows:

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A is an odd integer, C is one of the integers read from the input, and B is another integer read from the input)**
