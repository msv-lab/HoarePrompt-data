To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

- `i` is incremented by 1. This operation does not affect the calculation in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this purpose.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input.
- `X` is calculated as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print(X * C + B)
```

Given the definitions:
- `X = A // 2`
- The expression inside the print statement is `X * C + B`.

Substituting `X` with `A // 2`, the expression becomes:
- `(A // 2) * C + B`

Therefore, the print statement will output the result of the expression `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A, B, and C are integers obtained from the input)**
