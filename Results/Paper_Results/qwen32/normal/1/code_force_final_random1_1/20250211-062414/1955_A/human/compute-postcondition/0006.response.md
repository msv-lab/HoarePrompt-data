To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
- `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`.
- The current value of `A` is even.

The print statement is:
```python
print(int(A * C / 2))
```

Given that `A` is even, `A * C` will always be an even number because the product of an even number and any integer is even. When an even number is divided by 2, the result is always an integer, so the `int()` function does not change the value.

Therefore, the expression `int(A * C / 2)` computes half of the product of `A` and `C`.

Since the exact values of `A` and `C` are not specified, we cannot compute a specific numerical output. However, we can describe the output in terms of `A` and `C`.

Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A is an even integer and C is an integer)**
