Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is incremented by 1. This detail about `i` does not affect the print statement since `i` is not used in the print statement.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int(A * C / 2))
```

### Analysis:
- The expression inside the `print` function is `int(A * C / 2)`.
- `A` and `C` are integers read from the input.
- The expression `A * C / 2` performs multiplication of `A` and `C`, then divides the result by 2.
- The `int()` function converts the result of the division to an integer, effectively performing integer division if the result of `A * C / 2` is not already an integer.

### Output:
The output will be the integer result of the expression `A * C / 2`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A and C are integers read from the input)**
