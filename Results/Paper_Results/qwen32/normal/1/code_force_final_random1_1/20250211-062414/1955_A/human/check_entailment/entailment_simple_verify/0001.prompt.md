You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())

            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: i is equal to n, and t remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each containing three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price for one yogurt), and `b` (price for two yogurts on promotion). It then calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

Here's the program again for reference:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Logic Breakdown:
1. **Condition 1:** `if B * 2 < C`
   - This checks if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them at the promotional price.
   - If true, it prints `A * B`, which means buying all yogurts individually.

2. **Condition 2:** `elif A % 2 == 0`
   - This checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even.
   - If true, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which means buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price.

3. **Else Condition:**
   - This handles the case when `A` is odd.
   - It calculates the number of pairs (`X = A // 2`) and buys the remaining yogurt individually.
   - It prints `X * C + B`, which means buying `X` pairs and one additional yogurt individually.

### Testing the Program:
Let's verify the program with the provided example inputs and some additional edge cases:

#### Example Inputs:
1. **Input:** `2 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `9` (Buy 2 yogurts at the promotional price).
   - Program Output: `9` (Correct).

2. **Input:** `3 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `14` (Buy 2 yogurts at the promotional price and 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `14` (Correct).

3. **Input:** `3 5 11`
   - Expected Output: `15` (Buy 2 yogurts at the promotional price and 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `15` (Correct).

4. **Input:** `4 5 11`
   - Expected Output: `20` (Buy 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotional price).
   - Program Output: `20` (Correct).

#### Additional Edge Cases:
1. **Input:** `1 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `5` (Buy 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `5` (Correct).

2. **Input:** `2 5 10`
   - Expected Output: `10` (Buy 2 yogurts at the promotional price).
   - Program Output: `10` (Correct).

3. **Input:** `5 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `23` (Buy 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotional price and 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `23` (Correct).

4. **Input:** `6 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `27` (Buy 3 pairs of yogurts at the promotional price).
   - Program Output: `27` (Correct).

5. **Input:** `7 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `32` (Buy 3 pairs of yogurts at the promotional price and 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `32` (Correct).

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program with various inputs, including the provided examples and additional edge cases, the program appears to handle all scenarios correctly according to the problem description.

**Correctness: True**.
