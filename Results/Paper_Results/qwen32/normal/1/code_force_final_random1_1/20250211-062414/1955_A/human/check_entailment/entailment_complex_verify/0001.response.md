### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the logic and correctness of the provided program using the annotations and the original assessment.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each containing three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price for one yogurt), and `b` (price for two yogurts on promotion). It then calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts based on the following logic:

1. **Condition 1:** `if B * 2 < C`
   - This condition checks if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them at the promotional price.
   - If true, it prints `A * B`, which means buying all yogurts individually.
   - **Annotation Validation:** This part seems correct as it ensures that if individual purchase is cheaper, it opts for that.

2. **Condition 2:** `elif A % 2 == 0`
   - This condition checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even.
   - If true, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which means buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price.
   - **Annotation Validation:** This part also seems correct as it ensures that if the number of yogurts is even, it buys them in pairs.

3. **Else Condition:**
   - This handles the case when `A` is odd.
   - It calculates the number of pairs (`X = A // 2`) and buys the remaining yogurt individually.
   - It prints `X * C + B`, which means buying `X` pairs and one additional yogurt individually.
   - **Annotation Validation:** This part seems correct as it handles the scenario where the number of yogurts is odd.

#### Testing the Program:
Let's verify the program with the provided example inputs and some additional edge cases:

#### Example Inputs:
1. **Input:** `2 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `9` (Buy 2 yogurts at the promotional price).
   - Program Output: `9` (Correct).

2. **Input:** `3 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `14` (Buy 2 yogurts at the promotional price and 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `14` (Correct).

3. **Input:** `3 5 11`
   - Expected Output: `15` (Buy 2 yogurts at the promotional price and 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `15` (Correct).

4. **Input:** `4 5 11`
   - Expected Output: `20` (Buy 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotional price).
   - Program Output: `20` (Correct).

#### Additional Edge Cases:
1. **Input:** `1 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `5` (Buy 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `5` (Correct).

2. **Input:** `2 5 10`
   - Expected Output: `10` (Buy 2 yogurts at the promotional price).
   - Program Output: `10` (Correct).

3. **Input:** `5 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `23` (Buy 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotional price and 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `23` (Correct).

4. **Input:** `6 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `27` (Buy 3 pairs of yogurts at the promotional price).
   - Program Output: `27` (Correct).

5. **Input:** `7 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `32` (Buy 3 pairs of yogurts at the promotional price and 1 yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `32` (Correct).

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program with various inputs, including the provided examples and additional edge cases, the program appears to handle all scenarios correctly according to the problem description. The annotations provided align with the expected behavior of the program.

**Correctness: True**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
