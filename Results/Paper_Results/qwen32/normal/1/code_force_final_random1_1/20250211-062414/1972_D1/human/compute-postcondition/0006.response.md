To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the behavior of `func_10()` and `func_15()`. However, based on the provided information, we can infer the following:

- `func_10()` determines the number of times the loop will run.
- `func_15()` returns a value that gets printed in each iteration.

Since the loop runs `func_10()` times and prints the result of `func_15()` followed by a newline character in each iteration, the final output state will involve the loop having completed all iterations specified by `func_10()`.

Here's the final output state described in the required format:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` has returned a positive integer indicating the total number of iterations, and the value returned by `func_15()` has been written to standard output followed by a newline character for each of those iterations.**

In simpler terms, the loop has finished executing the number of times specified by `func_10()`, and in each iteration, it printed the result of `func_15()` followed by a newline character. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop.
