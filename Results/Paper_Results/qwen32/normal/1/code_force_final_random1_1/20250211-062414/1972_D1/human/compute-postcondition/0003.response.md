The provided code snippet writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` to the standard output, followed by a newline character. This action does not affect the variables `n` and `m` directly. The function `func_15()` is called, and its return value is printed, but there is no indication that it modifies `n` or `m`.

Given that the initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6, and `func_15()` returns a value that has already been printed, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` must return a positive integer, and the value returned by `func_15()` has been written to standard output followed by a newline character.**
