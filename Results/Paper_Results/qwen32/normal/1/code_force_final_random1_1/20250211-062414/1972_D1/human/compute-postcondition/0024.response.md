Functionality: **The function `func_12` calculates and assigns a rank to a given key `da` in the dictionary `d`. It returns 1 if the list associated with `da` contains only one element. Otherwise, it recursively explores the elements in the list, updating the `processing` list to mark elements as visited, and computes the minimum rank among the recursive calls, adding 1 to this minimum rank before returning it. The computed rank is stored in the `rank` list at the index corresponding to `da`.**
