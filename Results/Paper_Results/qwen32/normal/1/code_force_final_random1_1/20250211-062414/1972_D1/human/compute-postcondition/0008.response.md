Functionality: **The function `func_16` performs a series of operations involving the functions `func_10` and `func_15`. It writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output, followed by a newline character, for a number of times determined by the return value of `func_10()`. The function does not explicitly accept any parameters `n` and `m` as arguments, despite the annotations suggesting otherwise.**
