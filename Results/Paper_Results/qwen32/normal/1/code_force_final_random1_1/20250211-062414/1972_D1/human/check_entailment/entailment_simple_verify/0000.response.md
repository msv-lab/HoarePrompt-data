### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Analysis of Provided Code**:
   - The code includes multiple utility functions (`func_1` through `func_16`), many of which are not relevant to solving the problem.
   - `func_15` appears to attempt some form of calculation but does not correctly implement the required logic for counting valid pairs.
   - The core logic in `func_15` involves iterating and summing values based on a specific formula, which does not correspond to checking the condition \( (a + b) \% (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0 \).

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - A correct implementation would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \( (a + b) \% (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0 \).
   - The provided corrected version of the function `count_valid_pairs` correctly implements this logic.

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations describe the behavior of each function but do not indicate that any function correctly solves the problem.
   - The annotations confirm that `func_15` does not implement the required logic.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
