The given Python code snippet writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output followed by a newline character. This operation does not affect the variables `n` and `m` directly. The function `func_15()` is called, and its return value is converted to a string and written to the standard output.

Since the code only involves writing to the standard output and does not modify `n` or `m`, their values remain unchanged. The only effect is that the return value of `func_15()` is printed.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` must return a positive integer, and the value returned by `func_15()` has been written to standard output followed by a newline character.**
