Postcondition: **`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers, `da` is an integer key present in the dictionary `d`, `rank` is a list of integers, and `di` is the next element in the list `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, then `tmp` is the minimum of its previous value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 1000000000`.**
