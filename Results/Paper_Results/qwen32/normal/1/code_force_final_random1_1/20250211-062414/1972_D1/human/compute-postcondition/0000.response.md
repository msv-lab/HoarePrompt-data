In this case, the for loop iterates over the range returned by the function `func_10()`. To determine if the loop will execute, we need to understand what `func_10()` returns. Since the definition of `func_10()` is not provided, we can only assume that it returns some integer value.

For the loop to execute at least once, `func_10()` must return a positive integer. The variables `n` and `m` are mentioned in the initial state but are not part of the loop head, so they cannot be directly adjusted to ensure the loop executes. Therefore, the only thing we can specify is that `func_10()` should return a positive integer.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` must return a positive integer**
