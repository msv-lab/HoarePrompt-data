Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the solution to the given problem. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the provided code includes several unrelated functions (`func_1` through `func_16`) that do not address the problem at hand. Specifically, `func_15` seems to be the only function that attempts to solve a part of the problem, but it does not correctly implement the required logic.

Let's analyze `func_15`:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

This function calculates a value based on the input \(n\) and \(m\), but it does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). The logic inside this function does not match the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        m = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition \( (a + b) \% (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0 \). It then counts and prints the number of valid pairs for each test case.

Since the original code does not correctly implement the solution, the correctness is **False**.
