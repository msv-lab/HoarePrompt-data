Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_15()` is intended to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for a single test case, but it does not implement the logic required by the problem statement.

The problem requires checking pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, `func_15()` does not perform this check. Instead, it calculates something related to divisors of `n + i` which is unrelated to the problem requirements.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given constraints and check if they satisfy the condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`. Given the constraints, an efficient approach would be necessary to avoid a time limit exceeded error, possibly involving mathematical insights or optimizations.
