Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + k) // (k * k)` for all `k` from 1 to `i-1`, and `i` is the smallest integer such that `i * i > n + i`. Here, `n` is a positive integer obtained from another function `func_7()`, and `m` is also obtained from `func_7()` but is not used in the calculation.**
