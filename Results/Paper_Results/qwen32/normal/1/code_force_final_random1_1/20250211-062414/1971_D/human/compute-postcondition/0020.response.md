To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `len(s) - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is the integer read from the input (within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
- `s` is the new string input consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3.
- `j` is 2.

The loop condition is `j < len(s) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(s) - 1`. Since `j` is currently 2, `len(s) - 1` must be greater than 2. This means `len(s)` must be greater than 3.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only involves `j` and `len(s)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `len(s)` is greater than 3.

State: **`t` is the integer read from the input (within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `s` is the new string input consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length greater than 3; `j` is 2.**
