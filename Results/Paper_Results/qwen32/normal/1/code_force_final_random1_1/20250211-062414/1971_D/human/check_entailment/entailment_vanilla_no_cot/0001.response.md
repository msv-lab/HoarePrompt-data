To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its logic step-by-step in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) that a binary string can be divided into such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Key Insight:
A transition from '1' to '0' in the string indicates that a cut is necessary because any '0' that comes after a '1' cannot be part of the same substring if we want to sort the entire string without rearranging the order within the substrings. Each such transition represents a point where a new piece should start.

### Program Explanation:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`.
3. It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
4. It iterates through the string `s` up to the second-to-last character.
5. For each character, it checks if the current character is greater than the next character (`int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1])`). Since the string is binary, this condition is true only when there is a transition from '1' to '0'.
6. Each time this condition is met, it increments the `count` by 1.
7. Finally, it prints `count + 1`, which represents the number of pieces needed. The `+1` accounts for the initial piece before any cuts.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Test Case 1:** `11010`
  - Transitions: `1 -> 0` (at index 1), `1 -> 0` (at index 3)
  - Count: 2
  - Pieces Needed: 2 + 1 = 3
- **Test Case 2:** `00000000`
  - No transitions
  - Count: 0
  - Pieces Needed: 0 + 1 = 1
- **Test Case 3:** `1`
  - No transitions
  - Count: 0
  - Pieces Needed: 0 + 1 = 1
- **Test Case 4:** `10`
  - Transition: `1 -> 0`
  - Count: 1
  - Pieces Needed: 1 + 1 = 2
- **Test Case 5:** `0001111`
  - No transitions
  - Count: 0
  - Pieces Needed: 0 + 1 = 1
- **Test Case 6:** `0110`
  - Transition: `1 -> 0`
  - Count: 1
  - Pieces Needed: 1 + 1 = 2

All test cases match the expected output, confirming the logic of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the binary string into a sorted one.

**Correctness: True**
