Postcondition: **`t` is the integer read from the input (within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `s` is the new string input consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2; `j` is 0; if the character at position `j` in `s` is different from the character at position `j + 1`, then `count` is 2 and `flag` is True if the character at position `j` in `s` is '0' and the character at position `j + 1` in `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; otherwise, `count` remains 1 and `flag` remains False.**
