Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` strings `s` each consisting of characters '0' and '1'. For each string `s`, it calculates and prints the number of segments formed by consecutive identical characters, reducing the count by one if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1'.**
