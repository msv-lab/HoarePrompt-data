The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Given the initial state, `t` was already described as an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. After executing the code, the value of `t` is updated to the integer read from the input. The string `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input (within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.**
