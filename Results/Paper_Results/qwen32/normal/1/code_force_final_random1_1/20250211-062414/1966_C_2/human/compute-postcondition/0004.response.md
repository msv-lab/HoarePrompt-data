The code snippet provided only assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `dp`. No other variables are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tc` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a `0`; `dp` is `True`.**
