Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` must be at least 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a `0`, `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. The other variables remain unchanged.
