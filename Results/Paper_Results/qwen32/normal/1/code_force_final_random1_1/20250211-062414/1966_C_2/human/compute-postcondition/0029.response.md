To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition specified in the loop head. The loop will continue as long as `tc > 0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `tc` is at least 1
- `n` is `len(arr) - 1`
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a `0`
- `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`
- `i` is `n-1`

The loop condition is `while tc > 0:`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `tc` must still be greater than 0.

Since the only variable in the loop head is `tc`, we need to ensure that `tc` remains greater than 0. Given that `tc` is at least 1, no adjustment is strictly necessary to satisfy the condition `tc > 0`. However, to ensure clarity and correctness, we can explicitly state that `tc` should remain greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `tc` is greater than 0, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a `0`, `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is `n-1`**
