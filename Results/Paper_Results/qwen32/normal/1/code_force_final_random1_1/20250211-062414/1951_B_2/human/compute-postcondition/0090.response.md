The code snippet provided is `p = j`. This means that the variable `p` is being assigned the current value of `j`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `p`, which now holds the same value as `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is the new list of integers read from the input with `s[0]` and `s[k-1]` swapped; `h` is the value of `s[0]` after the swap; `j` is the index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` minus 1; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `p` is the value of `j`; `ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are equal to `h` (if `s[0] != h`) or less than or equal to `h` (if `z` was set to 1); `z` is 1 if any element equal to `h` was encountered after the first element, otherwise 0.**
