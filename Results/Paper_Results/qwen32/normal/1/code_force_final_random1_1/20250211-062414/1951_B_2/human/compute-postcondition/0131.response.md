The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. None of the other variables (`t`, `s`, `h`, `j`, `ans`, `p`, `ans1`, `z`) are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is the list of integers read from the input with `s[0]` and `s[k-1]` swapped; `h` is the original value of `s[k-1]`; `j` is the index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` minus 1; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `p` is the value of `j`; `ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` starting from the first occurrence of `h` in `s[1:]` (if any); `z` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `h` was encountered.**
