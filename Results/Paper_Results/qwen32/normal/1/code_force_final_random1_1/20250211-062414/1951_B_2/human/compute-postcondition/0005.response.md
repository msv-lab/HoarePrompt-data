The code appends the index `i` to the list `ind`. The values of `a`, `n`, `x`, and `c` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ind` now contains the index `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a list where the first element is an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is the rating of the cow owned by the player for the current test case, which is `a[k]`, `ind` is a list containing the index `i`, `c` is 0, and `a[i]` is greater than `x`.**
