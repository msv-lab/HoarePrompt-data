Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is the list of integers read from the input with `s[0]` and `s[k-1]` swapped and must have at least one element; `h` is the original value of `s[k-1]`; `j` is the index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` minus 1; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `p` is the value of `j`; `z` is 1; `i` is the next element in the list `s`. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `z` has been updated to 1. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
