You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list `a` containing multiple test cases. Each test case includes the number of cows `n`, the index `k` of the player's cow, and a list of distinct Cowdeforces ratings for the cows. For each test case, the function determines and returns a value based on the ratings relative to the player's cow. The return value can be `n - 1`, `k - 1`, or a calculated value derived from the indices of up to two cows with higher ratings than the player's cow.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the described problem. There are several issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the argument `a`, but `a` is not defined within the scope of the loop. Instead, the list `l` should be passed to `func_1`.

2. **Global Variable `n`**: The variable `n` is used inside `func_1` without being passed as an argument. This will result in a `NameError` because `n` is not defined in the local scope of `func_1`.

3. **Logic Errors**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to determine the maximum number of wins by finding the indices of the first two cows with ratings higher than the cow at index `k`. However, this logic is flawed.
   - The condition `if k == 14:` is arbitrary and does not serve any purpose in the logic.
   - The return statements do not correctly calculate the maximum number of wins based on the problem description.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases such as when `k` is the last cow or when the cow at index `k` has the highest rating.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
3 2
1 3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The cow at index 2 (rating 3) will win against the cow at index 1 (rating 1).
- The cow at index 2 (rating 3) will lose against the cow at index 3 (rating 2).
- Therefore, the cow at index 2 wins 1 match.

**Actual Output from Provided Code:**
The code will likely produce an incorrect output due to the logic errors mentioned above.

Given these issues, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
