To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans, ans1))` statement, let's break down the initial state and how the variables are defined:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable represents the number of test cases but does not directly affect the current print statement.

2. **`n` and `k`**: Integers read from the input. `n` likely represents the length of the list `s`, and `k` is used to determine which element in `s` to swap with `s[p]`.

3. **`s`**: A list of integers read from the input. The element at index `p` is swapped with the element at index `k-1`.

4. **`h`**: The value of `s[0]` before the swap. This is the first element of the list `s` before any modifications.

5. **`j`**: The index of the last element compared to `h` before the loop breaks or completes. This variable is used to track the progress of a loop that compares elements of `s` to `h`.

6. **`p`**: The value of `j`. This means `p` is also the index of the last element compared to `h`.

7. **`ans`**: The count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`. This counts how many elements in the list `s` (excluding the first element) are less than or equal to the original first element `h`.

8. **`ans1`**: The count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` and meet the specified conditions. The exact conditions are not specified in the initial state, but it implies that `ans1` is a subset count of `ans`.

9. **`z`**: A flag that is 1 if any element equal to `h` is found after the initial comparison, otherwise 0. This flag is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.

Given these definitions, the `print(max(ans, ans1))` statement will print the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1`.

### Explanation of Values:
- **`ans`**: Counts the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`.
- **`ans1`**: Counts a subset of those elements that meet additional unspecified conditions.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the larger of the two counts, `ans` and `ans1`.

Output: **max(ans, ans1) (where ans is the count of elements in s[1:] that are less than or equal to h, and ans1 is the count of those elements that meet additional specified conditions)**
