Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is a list of integers read from the input with `s[p]` swapped with `s[k-1]` and must have at least one element; `h` is the value of `s[0]` (before the swap); `j` is the index of the last element compared to `h` before the loop breaks or completes, incremented by 1; `p` is the value of `j`; `i` is `s[j]`. If `i == h`, no changes are made to `ans1` or `z`. If `i != h` and `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1 and `z` is set to 1. If `i > h`, the most internal loop or if statement breaks. If `i <= h` and `z == 1`, `ans1` is incremented by 1.**
