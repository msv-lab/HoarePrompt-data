Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of elements that can be made non-decreasing by potentially swapping the element at index `k-1` with another element in the list.**
