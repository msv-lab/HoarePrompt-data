Postcondition: **`ind` is an empty list, and `c` is the count of cows with higher ratings than `x` (0, 1, or 2). If `k` equals 14, the state of `ind` and `c` remains as described, and all other variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, the state of `ind` and `c` remains unchanged, and all other variables remain unchanged.**
