Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is a list of integers read from the input with `s[p]` swapped with `s[k-1]` and must have at least one element; `h` is the value of `s[0]` (before the swap); `j` is the index of the last element compared to `h` before the loop breaks or completes; `p` is the value of `j`; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; if `i` equals `h`, then `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 1; if `i` does not equal `h`, `ans1` is 1 if `z` was 1, otherwise `ans1` remains 0; `z` remains unchanged if `i` does not equal `h`; `i` may or may not equal `h`.**
