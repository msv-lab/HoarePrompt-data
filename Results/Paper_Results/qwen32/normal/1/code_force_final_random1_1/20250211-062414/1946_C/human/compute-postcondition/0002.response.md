Let's analyze the given for loop and determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the next iteration:

The loop statement is:
```python
for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can infer that:
- The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable (not used within the loop).
- The number of iterations is determined by the integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- An integer has been read from `sys.stdin.readline()` and it must be greater than 0.
- The function `solve()` has been executed.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
- The integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` determines the number of iterations.
- Since the loop has just completed an iteration, the number of remaining iterations should be one less than the number read initially.

Let's denote the integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` as `num_iterations`. After one iteration, `num_iterations` should be decremented by 1.

Since the loop variable `_` is not relevant to the state (as it is not used), we don't need to adjust it.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `num_iterations` has been decremented by 1.

State: **The integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be greater than 0 and decremented by 1, and `solve()` has been executed.**

However, since we cannot directly modify the value read from `sys.stdin.readline()`, we can represent the state in terms of the remaining iterations:

State: **There are `num_iterations - 1` remaining iterations where `num_iterations` is the integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` and it must be greater than 0, and `solve()` has been executed.**
