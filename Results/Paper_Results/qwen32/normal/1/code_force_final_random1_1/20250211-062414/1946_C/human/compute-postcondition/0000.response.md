In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the integer value read from `sys.stdin.readline()`. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning it is not used within the loop body. Therefore, the only variable that affects whether the loop executes is the integer value read from standard input.

To ensure the loop executes, this integer value must be greater than 0. The loop variable `_` does not need to be initialized or modified before the loop starts because it is automatically assigned by the `range()` function during each iteration.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` is greater than 0.

State: **The integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be greater than 0**
