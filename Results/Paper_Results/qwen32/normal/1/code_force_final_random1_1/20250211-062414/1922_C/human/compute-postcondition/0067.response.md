Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `m`, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`, and `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`. If the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is less than the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`, then `d1[i + 2]` is `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. The value of `d1[2]` remains `1` unless modified by the if condition.**
