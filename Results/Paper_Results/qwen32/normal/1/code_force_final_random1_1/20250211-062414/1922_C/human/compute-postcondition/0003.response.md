The given code initializes a `defaultdict` named `d1` with a default factory of `int`. This means that if a key does not exist in `d1`, accessing it will return `0` (the default value for an `int`).

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, and `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input. None of these variables are modified by the provided code snippet.

Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the addition of the new variable `d1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`.**
