To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input.
- There is a dictionary `d1` that contains integer keys and integer values.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet accesses the values associated with keys `y` and `x` in the dictionary `d1`.
- It then subtracts the value associated with key `x` from the value associated with key `y`.
- The result of this subtraction is printed.

### Values:
- Since the exact contents of the dictionary `d1` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.
- However, we know that `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` are the values stored in the dictionary `d1` corresponding to the keys `y` and `x`, respectively.

### Output Description:
The output will be the result of the expression `d1[y] - d1[x]`, where `d1[y]` is the value in the dictionary `d1` at key `y`, and `d1[x]` is the value in the dictionary `d1` at key `x`.

Thus, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] is the value in the dictionary d1 at key y, and d1[x] is the value in the dictionary d1 at key x)**
