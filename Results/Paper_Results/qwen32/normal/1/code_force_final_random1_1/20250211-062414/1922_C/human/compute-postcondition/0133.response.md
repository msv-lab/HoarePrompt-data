The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the key `n - 1` in the dictionary `d2`. This operation does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the only change is the addition of the new key-value pair in `d2`.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `d1` has keys from `3` to `n` with values computed based on the differences in `l` and previous values in `d1`, `d2[n - 1]` is `1`.**
