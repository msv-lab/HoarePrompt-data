The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration and continues as long as `i` is greater than 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `n - 3`.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is at least 3, `l` remains the same list of integers, `d1` has keys from `3` to `n` with values calculated based on the differences in `l`. `d2` has its value at key `n - 1` set to `1` and its value at key `n - 2` set to `2` if `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`. Otherwise, `d2` has its value at key `n - 2` set to `l[n - 2] - l[n - 3] + 1`.**
