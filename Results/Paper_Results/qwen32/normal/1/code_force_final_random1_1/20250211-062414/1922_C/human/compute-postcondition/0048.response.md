To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input.
- The code snippet attempts to print the result of `d2[y] - d2[x]`.

However, the initial state does not provide any information about the dictionary `d2` or its contents. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` without additional information.

Given this, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables and the operation being performed:

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2 is a dictionary, y and x are integers obtained from the input, and d2[y] and d2[x] are the values associated with keys y and x in the dictionary d2 respectively)**
