To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is equal to `m`.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `l` is a list of integers from the input.
- `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with a default factory of `int`.

Since the loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `n - 2`, the next iteration would require `i` to be incremented by 1.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Increment `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `m + 1`.
2. **Check Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. Given that `i` is now `m + 1`, the condition `m + 1 < n - 1` must hold true for the loop to execute again. This implies `m + 1 < n - 1` or `m < n - 2`.

### Final State:
- `i` is `m + 1`.
- `n` must be such that `m + 1 < n - 1` (or equivalently, `m < n - 2`).

Other variables (`l`, `d1`, `d2`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `n` must be greater than `m + 2`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`, and `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`**.
