To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the behavior of the loop based on the provided code and the initial state.

The loop iterates `m` times, where `m` is an input integer. During each iteration, the program reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input. Depending on whether `y` is greater than `x`, it prints the difference between `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` or `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.

Since the problem specifies that the values of `x` and `y` do not change during the loop iterations, and no other variables within the loop body affect the state outside the loop, the only variable that changes is the loop counter `j`.

After all `m` iterations, the loop counter `j` will have reached `m`. The values of `x` and `y` from the last iteration will still be available, but they do not affect the overall state since they are not stored or used further after each iteration.

Therefore, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **The loop has completed `m` iterations, and the loop counter `j` is equal to `m`. The values of `x` and `y` from the last iteration are available but do not affect the overall state.**

In simpler terms, the loop has finished running `m` times, and no further changes occur to the variables `x` and `y` outside the loop context.
