Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `m`, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` and `d1[2]` is `1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`. Additionally, the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is less than the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`.**
