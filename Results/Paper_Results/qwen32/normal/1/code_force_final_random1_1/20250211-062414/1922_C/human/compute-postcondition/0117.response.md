The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the key `2` in the defaultdict `d1`. This means that `d1[2]` now holds the value `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `1`, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `d1[2]` is `1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is greater than `0`, `j` is `m - 1`.**
