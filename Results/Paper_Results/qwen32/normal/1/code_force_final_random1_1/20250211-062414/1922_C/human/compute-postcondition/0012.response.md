To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, and `d2`. However, according to the problem statement, only `i` and `n` can be adjusted because they are the only variables directly involved in controlling the loop's execution.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\)
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`. If `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is less than `l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[2]` is 1 and `d1[i + 2]` is `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.
- `d2` remains a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`.

In the previous iteration, `i` was used to index into the list `l` and update the defaultdict `d1`. At the end of this iteration, `i` has taken on some value within the range `[1, n-2]`.

For the next iteration to occur, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be within the range `[1, n-2]`.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Since `i` was previously in the range `[1, n-2]`, the new value of `i` (`i_prev + 1`) should be in the range `[2, n-1]`. To ensure the loop continues, `i` must be less than `n-1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\); `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`; `d2` remains a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we express the state in terms of the increment:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\); `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`; `d2` remains a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`; `i` is `i + 1`**.

However, to be precise about the range, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

So, if we denote the previous value of `i` as `k`, then:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\); `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`; `d2` remains a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`; `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

But since we need to provide a general form without knowing `k`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\); `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`; `d2` remains a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

To make it clear:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\); `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`; `d2` remains a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since `i` was in the range `[1, n-2]` at the end of the previous iteration, it should now be in the range `[2, n-1]` at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\); `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`; `d2` remains a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`; `i` is `i + 1`**.
