You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        d1 = defaultdict(int)

                d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
            else:
                d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]

                d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]
            else:
                d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]
        m = int(input())
        for j in range(m):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            if y > x:
                print(d1[y] - d1[x])
            else:
                print(d2[y] - d2[x])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of city positions and a series of queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the cumulative distance from one city to another based on precomputed shortest paths in both forward and backward directions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Closest City Logic:**
   - For each city `i`, the closest city `j` is the one where the distance `|a_i - a_j|` is minimized.
   - The problem guarantees that the closest city is unique for each city.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming to precompute the minimum cost to reach the end of the list (rightmost city) starting from any city using the closest city rule.
   - It also computes the minimum cost to reach the start of the list (leftmost city) starting from any city using the closest city rule.
   
3. **Precomputing Costs:**
   - `d1[i]` represents the minimum cost to travel from city `i` to the rightmost city using the closest city rule.
   - `d2[i]` represents the minimum cost to travel from city `i` to the leftmost city using the closest city rule.
   
4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - For each query `(x, y)`, the program calculates the cost to travel from city `x` to city `y` based on the precomputed costs.
   - If `y > x`, it uses `d1[y] - d1[x]`.
   - If `y < x`, it uses `d2[y] - d2[x]`.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Initialization and Indexing Errors:**
   - The program initializes `d1[2] = 1` and `d2[n - 1] = 1`. However, the indexing seems off. Cities are indexed from 1 to `n`, but the program uses 0-based indexing in some places.
   - The loop ranges and indices need to be adjusted to correctly reflect the 1-based indexing of cities.

2. **Cost Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the cost in `d1` and `d2` arrays is incorrect. The program should only add 1 when moving to the closest city, and the direct distance otherwise.
   - The current implementation incorrectly adds the direct distance to the cost, which is not what the problem requires.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - The program assumes that the cost can be calculated by simply subtracting precomputed values, which is not correct due to the issues mentioned above.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified in the program's logic and indexing, the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for each query based on the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
