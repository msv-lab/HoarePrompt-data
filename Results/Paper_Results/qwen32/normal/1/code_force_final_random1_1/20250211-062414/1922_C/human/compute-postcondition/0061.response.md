The code assigns the value `1` to the key `2` in the dictionary `d1`. This means that the value associated with the key `2` in `d1` is now `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `m`; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` and `d1[2]` is `1`; `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`.**
