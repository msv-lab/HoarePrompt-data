To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `i` is initialized to `0`.
- `n` is at least `3`.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `d1` is a dictionary with keys ranging from `3` to `n`, where the values are calculated based on the differences in `l`.
- `d2` is a dictionary with its value at key `n - 1` set to `1` and its values at keys from `n - 2` down to `1` set according to specific conditions in a loop.
- `m` must be greater than `0`.
- `x` is the first input integer.
- `y` is the second input integer, and it is greater than `x`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

#### Understanding `d1`:
- `d1` is a dictionary with keys from `3` to `n`.
- The values in `d1` are calculated based on differences in the list `l`. Specifically, the value at key `k` in `d1` (denoted as `d1[k]`) is likely calculated as the difference between some elements in `l` related to the index `k`.

Given that the exact formula for `d1[k]` is not explicitly stated, we can only infer that `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` are differences calculated from the list `l` at positions related to `y` and `x` respectively.

### Calculation of the Output:
The print statement calculates the difference between `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`. Since `y > x`, this difference represents the net change in the differences calculated from the list `l` between indices `x` and `y`.

### Final Output:
Without the explicit formula for `d1[k]` and the exact values in `l`, we cannot compute the numerical value of `d1[y] - d1[x]`. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] and d1[x] are differences calculated from the list l at positions related to y and x respectively)**
