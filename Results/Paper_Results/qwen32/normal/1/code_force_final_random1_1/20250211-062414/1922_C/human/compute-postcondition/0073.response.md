The given code updates the value of `d1[i + 2]` by setting it to `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Since `d1` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of `int`, `d1[i + 1]` will be `0` if it hasn't been set before. Therefore, `d1[i + 2]` will be `1`.

The values of `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1[i + 1]`, and `d2` remain unchanged except for the new assignment in `d1`.

Output State: **`i` is `m + 2`, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` and `d1[i + 2]` is `1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`**.
