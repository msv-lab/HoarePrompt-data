To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the given for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `i`, `n`, and the range function parameters.

Given for loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The variable `i` is the loop control variable.
   - It is initialized to 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - Before the loop starts, `i` is set to `m`. This value of `m` does not affect the loop's execution directly since `i` is re-initialized to 1 in the first iteration.
   - Therefore, there is no need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the range `(1, n-1)` must contain at least one integer.
   - This means `n-1` must be greater than or equal to 1, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than 2.
   - Therefore, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than 2.

3. **List `l` and Dictionaries `d1` and `d2`:**
   - These variables (`l`, `d1`, `d2`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `n`. It must be greater than 2 to ensure the loop executes at least once.

State: **`i` is equal to `m`, `n` must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` and `d1[2]` is `1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`**
