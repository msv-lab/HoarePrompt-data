The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. This means `n` will take on the integer value provided by the user input. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer.**
