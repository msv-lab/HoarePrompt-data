To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the conditions described.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variable `i`:** 
   - `i` is set to `0`.

2. **Dictionary `d2`:**
   - `d2` has been updated for all keys from `1` to `n - 2` based on specific conditions:
     - If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]`.
     - Else, `d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.
   - Note that `d2` is not directly used in the print statement, but it provides context about how certain values might be computed.

3. **Variable `m`:**
   - `m` is greater than `0`.

4. **Variables `x` and `y`:**
   - `x` and `y` are new input integers.
   - If `y > x`, then `y` remains greater than `x`.
   - Otherwise, `y <= x`.

5. **Variable `j`:**
   - `j` is set to `2`.

6. **Dictionary `d1`:**
   - The dictionary `d1` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is referenced in the print statement. Therefore, we need to infer its contents based on the context.

### Analysis:

Given that `d1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we must assume that `d1` is a dictionary that has been populated with some values prior to this print statement. The print statement calculates the difference between `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

### Output Explanation:

- Since the exact contents of `d1` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.
- However, we can describe the output in terms of the values stored in `d1` for keys `y` and `x`.

### Final Output:

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1 is a dictionary with keys y and x, and d1[y] and d1[x] are the values associated with these keys in the dictionary d1)**
