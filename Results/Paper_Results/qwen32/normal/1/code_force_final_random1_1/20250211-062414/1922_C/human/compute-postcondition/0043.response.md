To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the code step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input.
- `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(d2[y] - d2[x])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables `x` and `y`:**
   - These are integers obtained from the input.
   - It is given that `y <= x`.

2. **Dictionary `d2`:**
   - The dictionary `d2` is not explicitly defined in the initial state.
   - We need to assume that `d2` is a dictionary that contains keys corresponding to the values of `x` and `y`.
   - Since `y <= x`, both `y` and `x` should be valid keys in the dictionary `d2`.

3. **Expression `d2[y] - d2[x]`:**
   - This expression calculates the difference between the values associated with keys `y` and `x` in the dictionary `d2`.

### Conclusion:
- The output will be the result of subtracting the value of `d2[x]` from the value of `d2[y]`.
- Since the specific values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are not provided, we cannot compute a numerical result.
- However, we can describe the output in terms of the dictionary `d2` and the keys `y` and `x`.

### Final Output:
Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2 is a dictionary, y and x are integers such that y <= x)**
