The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m + 1`, `n` is greater than `m + 2`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `m + 2`. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `n - 1` is greater than `m + 1`, so `i = m + 2` satisfies this condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is `m + 2`, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`, and `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`**.
