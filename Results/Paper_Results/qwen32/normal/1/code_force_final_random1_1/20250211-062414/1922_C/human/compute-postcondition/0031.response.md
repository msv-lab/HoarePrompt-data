Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\), `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the differences in the list `l` for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \), and `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`. If `l[4] - l[3] < l[5] - l[4]`, then `d2[4]` is `1 + d2[5]`. Otherwise, `d2[4]` is `l[4] - l[3]`. `i` remains 4.**
