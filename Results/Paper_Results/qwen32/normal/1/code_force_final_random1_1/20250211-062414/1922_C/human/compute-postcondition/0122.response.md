The code assigns a new value to `d1[i + 2]`. Specifically, `d1[i + 2]` is set to the sum of `l[i + 1] - l[i]` and `d1[i + 1]`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is `1`
- `n` is greater than `2`
- The difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is not less than the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`

After executing the line of code, the value of `d1[i + 2]` (which is `d1[3]`) changes to `l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is `1`, `n` is greater than `2`, the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is not less than the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`, `d1[3]` is `l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]`**.
