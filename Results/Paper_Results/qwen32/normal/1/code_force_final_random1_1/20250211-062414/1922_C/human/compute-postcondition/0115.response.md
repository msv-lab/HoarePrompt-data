The given code snippet initializes `d1` as a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. This means that any key accessed in `d1` that does not exist will automatically be created with a default value of `0`.

Given the initial state, the only change made by the code is the reinitialization of `d1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `1`, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the new list of integers from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory (all keys not explicitly set will have a value of `0`), `d2` has its value at key `n - 1` set to `1` and its values at keys from `n - 2` down to `1` set according to the conditions specified in the loop, `m` is greater than `0`, `j` is `m - 1`.**
