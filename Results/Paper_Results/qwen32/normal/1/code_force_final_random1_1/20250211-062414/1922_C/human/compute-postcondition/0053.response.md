To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input.
- There is a dictionary `d2` which is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we can infer it must exist for the code to run without errors.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(d2[y] - d2[x])
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet accesses the values associated with keys `y` and `x` in the dictionary `d2`.
- It then computes the difference between these two values (`d2[y] - d2[x]`).
- Finally, it prints the result of this subtraction.

### Values:
- Since the specific contents of `d2` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.
- However, we can describe the output in terms of the dictionary `d2`.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the difference between the value stored at key `y` and the value stored at key `x` in the dictionary `d2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2 is a dictionary and y, x are integers)**
