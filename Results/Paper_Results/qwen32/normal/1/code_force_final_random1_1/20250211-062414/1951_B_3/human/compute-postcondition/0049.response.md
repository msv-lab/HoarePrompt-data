Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is a list of integers with at least one element where the element at index `j` and the element at index `k-1` have been swapped; `h` is the first element of the list `s`; `j` is the index of the first element in `s[1:]` that is greater than `h`, or `len(s) - 2` if no such element exists; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `p` is equal to `j`; `i` is the next element in the list `s` after its current value; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
