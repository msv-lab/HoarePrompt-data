To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans, ans1))` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the definitions of the variables involved:

1. **t**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable seems to represent the number of test cases or iterations but does not directly affect the current print statement.
   
2. **n and k**: These are integers read from the input. `n` likely represents the length of the list `s`, and `k` is an index used to swap elements within `s`.

3. **s**: A list of integers read from the input. The elements at indices `0` and `k-1` have been swapped.

4. **h**: The original value of `s[k-1]` before the swap.

5. **j**: The index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` minus 1. Since it is the index of the last element processed minus 1, it indicates how many elements have been considered so far in `s[1:]`.

6. **ans**: The count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`.

7. **p**: The value of `j`. This variable seems redundant since `p` is just another name for `j`.

8. **ans1**: The count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`, starting from the first occurrence of `h` in `s[1:]` (if any).

9. **z**: Either 0 or 1 depending on whether `h` was encountered in `s[1:]`.

Given these definitions, the `print(max(ans, ans1))` statement will print the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1`.

### Analysis of `ans` and `ans1`:
- **ans**: Counts all elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`.
- **ans1**: Counts elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`, but only starting from the first occurrence of `h` in `s[1:]`.

Since `ans1` is a subset of `ans` (it counts only from the first occurrence of `h`), `ans` will always be greater than or equal to `ans1`. Therefore, `max(ans, ans1)` will simply be `ans`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(max(ans, ans1))` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the original value of `s[k-1]` (denoted as `h`).

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of elements in s[1:] that are less than or equal to h)**
