You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list `a` containing multiple test cases. Each test case includes the number of cows `n`, the index `k` of the player's cow, and a list of distinct Cowdeforces ratings for the cows. For each test case, the function determines and returns a value based on the ratings relative to the player's cow. The return value can be `n - 1`, `k - 1`, or a calculated value derived from the indices of up to two cows with higher ratings than the player's cow.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve in a tournament where cows compete based on their ratings. Cow `k` can swap positions with another cow once, or choose not to swap at all. The goal is to maximize the number of wins for cow `k`.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve this problem by defining a function `func_1` which calculates the maximum number of wins for cow `k`. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of cows `n` and the index of cow `k` (1-based) are read.
   - The list of ratings `l` is read.

2. **Adjusting Index:**
   - The index `k` is adjusted to be 0-based by subtracting 1.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The rating of cow `k` is stored in `x`.
   - An empty list `ind` is initialized to store indices of cows with ratings higher than `x`.
   - A counter `c` is initialized to count the number of such cows.
   - The code iterates through the list of ratings:
     - If a cow's rating is greater than `x`, its index is added to `ind` and `c` is incremented.
     - If `c` reaches 2, the loop breaks.
   - Special debug print for `k == 14` is included but irrelevant to correctness.
   - Based on the contents of `ind`, the function returns the maximum number of wins:
     - If `ind` is empty, cow `k` would win all matches (`n - 1`).
     - If there is only one higher-rated cow, the number of wins is calculated based on its position.
     - If there are two higher-rated cows, the number of wins is calculated based on their positions relative to `k`.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Global Variable `n`:** The variable `n` is used inside `func_1` without being passed as an argument. This will cause a `NameError` because `n` is not defined in the scope of `func_1`.
2. **Logic Errors:**
   - The logic for calculating the maximum number of wins is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly account for the scenario where cow `k` can swap positions to maximize wins.
   - The condition checks and calculations for the number of wins are incorrect and do not cover all edge cases.
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle cases where cow `k` is already in a position to win multiple matches without swapping.
   - The code does not consider the optimal position to swap cow `k` to maximize wins.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the code, particularly the incorrect logic and the use of undefined variables, the program is not correct.

**Correctness:** **False**
