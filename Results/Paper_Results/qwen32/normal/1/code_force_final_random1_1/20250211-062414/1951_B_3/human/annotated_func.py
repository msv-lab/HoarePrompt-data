#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following 2t elements describes a test case: the first element of each test case is a pair of integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of cows and the index of the cow owned by the player, respectively. The second element of each test case is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all a_i being distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list `a` containing multiple test cases. Each test case includes the number of cows `n`, the index `k` of the player's cow, and a list of distinct Cowdeforces ratings for the cows. For each test case, the function determines and returns a value based on the ratings relative to the player's cow. The return value can be `n - 1`, `k - 1`, or a calculated value derived from the indices of up to two cows with higher ratings than the player's cow.
