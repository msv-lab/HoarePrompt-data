The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of the variable `ans` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is the list of integers read from the input with `s[0]` swapped with `s[k-1]` and must have at least two elements; `h` is the value of `s[0]`; `j` is 1; `p` is the value of `j` (which is 0 before this increment); `ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` starting from the first occurrence of `h` in `s[1:]` (if any); `z` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `h` was encountered; `ans` is set to 1 if `h` is not less than `i` in the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is the next element in `s[1:]` following its current value**.
