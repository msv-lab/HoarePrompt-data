Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is the list of integers read from the input with `s[0]` and `s[k-1]` swapped; `h` is the original value of `s[k-1]`; `j` is the index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` minus 1; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `p` is the value of `j`; `ans1` is 0; `z` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is the list of integers read from the input with `s[0]` and `s[k-1]` swapped and must have at least one element; `h` is the original value of `s[k-1]`; `j` is the index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` minus 1; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `p` is the value of `j`; `z` is either 0 or 1; if `i` equals `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` remains 0, and `z` is set to 1; if `i` does not equal `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` was 1 and `i` is less than or equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is the list of integers read from the input with `s[0]` and `s[k-1]` swapped and must have at least one element; `h` is the original value of `s[k-1]`; `j` is the index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` minus 1; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `p` is the value of `j`; `z` is either 0 or 1; `i` is `s[j + 2]` if `j + 2` is a valid index in `s`. If `i` equals `h`, `z` is set to 1 and `ans1` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` remains 0. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1. If `i` does not equal `h`, `ans1` is 1 if `z` was 1 and `i` is less than or equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` remains 0. If `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement breaks. If `z` is 1 and `i` is not greater than `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is the list of integers read from the input with `s[0]` and `s[k-1]` swapped and must have at least one element; `h` is the original value of `s[k-1]`; `j` is the index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` minus 1; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `p` is the value of `j`; `z` is either 0 or 1; `i` is the next element in the list `s`. If `i` equals `h`, `z` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `z` is 1 and `i` is not greater than `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
