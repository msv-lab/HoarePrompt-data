Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans = 0
    h = s[0]
    j = -1
    for i in s[1:]:
        j += 1
        if h < i:
            break
        else:
            ans += 1
    p = j
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans1 = 0
    s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
    z = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == h:
            if s[0] != h:
                ans1 += 1
            z = 1
        elif i > h:
            break
        elif z == 1:
            ans1 += 1
    print(max(ans, ans1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is a list of integers where the element at index `j` and the element at index `k-1` have been swapped; `h` is the first element of the list `s`; `j` is the index of the first element in `s[1:]` that is greater than `h`, or `len(s) - 2` if no such element exists; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `p` is equal to `j`; `ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are equal to `h` (if `s[0] != h`) or less than or equal to `h` (if `z` was set to 1); `z` is 1 if any element equal to `h` was encountered after the first element, otherwise 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is the list of integers read from the input with `s[0]` and `s[k-1]` swapped; `h` is the original value of `s[k-1]`; `j` is the index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` minus 1; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `p` is the value of `j`; `ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` starting from the first occurrence of `h` in `s[1:]` (if any); `z` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `h` was encountered.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is a list of integers read from the input with `s[p]` swapped with `s[k-1]`; `h` is the value of `s[0]` (before the swap); `j` is the index of the last element compared to `h` before the loop breaks or completes; `p` is the value of `j`; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` and meet the specified conditions; `z` is 1 if any element equal to `h` is found after the initial comparison, otherwise 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
