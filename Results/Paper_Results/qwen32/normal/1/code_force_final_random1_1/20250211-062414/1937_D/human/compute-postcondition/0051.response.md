The code snippet `B.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `B`. Since `B` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it was initially an empty list `[]`. After appending `0`, `B` becomes `[0]`.

The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `n`, `j_old`, `j`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `n` must be greater than `j_old + 2`, `j` is `j_old + 1`, `i` is `n - 2 - j_old`, `B = [0]`**.
