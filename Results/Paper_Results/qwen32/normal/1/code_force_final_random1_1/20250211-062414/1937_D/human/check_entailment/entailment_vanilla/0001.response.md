Let's analyze the given Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We have a grid with `n` cells, each containing either '<' or '>'.
- A pinball starts at each cell `i` and moves according to the direction indicated by the character in the cell.
- The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
- The goal is to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to solve this problem efficiently using two auxiliary arrays, `A` and `B`, to keep track of the cumulative movements for '>' and '<' directions respectively. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - For each test case, the grid size `n` and the grid string `s` are read.
   - Two functions, `func_1`, are called to process the grid string and compute the required results.

2. **Processing '>' Directions**:
   - An array `A` is used to store the cumulative movements for cells containing '>' from left to right.
   - `idx_A` keeps track of the indices of these cells.
   - For each cell `i`:
     - If `s[i]` is '>', it calculates the cumulative movement based on previous '>' cells and stores it in `A`.
     - The index `i` is added to `idx_A`.

3. **Processing '<' Directions**:
   - An array `B` is used to store the cumulative movements for cells containing '<' from right to left.
   - `idx_B` keeps track of the indices of these cells.
   - For each cell `i` (from right to left):
     - If `s[i]` is '<', it calculates the cumulative movement based on previous '<' cells and stores it in `B`.
     - The index `i` is added to `idx_B`.

4. **Calculating Results**:
   - Two pointers, `l` and `r`, are used to traverse `A` and `B` respectively.
   - For each cell `i`:
     - If `s[i]` is '>', it calculates the total time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using values from `A` and `B`.
     - If `s[i]` is '<', it performs similar calculations but in reverse order.
   - The result for each cell is printed.

### Issues in the Program:
The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect:
1. **Incorrect Calculation Logic**: The logic for calculating the cumulative movements and the final time taken for the pinball to leave the grid seems flawed. The formulas used do not correctly account for the inversion of characters and the resulting changes in direction.
2. **Boundary Conditions**: The handling of boundary conditions (when the pinball leaves the grid) is not correctly implemented.
3. **Complexity**: The approach appears overly complex and may not handle all edge cases efficiently.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the program's logic and complexity, it is clear that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
