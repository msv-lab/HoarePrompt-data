The code assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `a`. Given that `l` is 0, `l - 1` would be `-1`. In Python, negative indexing starts from the end of the list, so `A[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `A`, which is `3`.

Therefore, `a` is assigned the value `3`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `l = 0`, `r = 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `l` is not equal to 0, `a = 3`**.
