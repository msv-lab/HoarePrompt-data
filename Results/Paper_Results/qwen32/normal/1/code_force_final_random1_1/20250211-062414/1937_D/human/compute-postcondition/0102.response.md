Postcondition: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `l` is equal to 0, then `r` remains 2. If `l` is not equal to 0, then `l` remains 0, `r` remains 2, `a` is set to 3, and `b` is set to `2 * i`.**
