Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
- `B = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `r` is decreased by 1

Code Snippet:
```python
a = B[r]
```

Impact of the code:
- The variable `a` is assigned the value of `B[r]`. Since `r` is decreased by 1, its exact value is not specified, but we know it refers to an index in the list `B`.

Let's consider the possible values of `r`:
- If `r` was initially 2 (the highest valid index for `B`), after decreasing by 1, `r` would be 1.
- If `r` was initially 1, after decreasing by 1, `r` would be 0.
- If `r` was initially 0, after decreasing by 1, `r` would be -1, which is out of bounds for `B`.

Since `r` is decreased by 1, and assuming `r` was within the valid range (0 to 2) before the decrement, `r` could be either 1 or 0 after the decrement.

Therefore:
- If `r` is 1, `a = B[1] = 1`.
- If `r` is 0, `a = B[0] = 0`.

The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `s[i]`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is either `0` or `1` depending on the new value of `r`**.
