To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

Given:
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
- `n` must be greater than `j_old + 2`
- `j` is `j_old + 1`
- `i` is `n - 2 - j_old`

Code Snippet:
```python
x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
```

From the code snippet, we see that `x` is being calculated based on elements of `B` and `idx_B`. However, `B` and `idx_B` are not defined in the initial state. To proceed, we'll assume `B` and `idx_B` are lists similar to `A` and `idx_A` for the sake of this example.

Let's assume:
- `B = [0, 1, 2]` (arbitrary list of length 3)
- `idx_B = [6, 7, 8]` (arbitrary list of length 3)

Now, let's calculate `x`:
- `len(B) - 1` is `2` (since `B` has 3 elements)
- `B[len(B) - 1]` is `B[2]` which is `2`
- `idx_B[len(B) - 1]` is `idx_B[2]` which is `8`
- `len(idx_B)` is `3` (since `idx_B` has 3 elements)

Thus,
```python
x = 2 + (8 - i) * 3
```

We know `i` is `n - 2 - j_old`. Let's assume `j_old` is `0` for simplicity (as it's not specified):
- `j` is `j_old + 1` which is `1`
- `i` is `n - 2 - j_old` which is `n - 2`

Since `n` must be greater than `j_old + 2`, let's assume `n` is `4`:
- `i` is `4 - 2` which is `2`

Now, substituting `i`:
```python
x = 2 + (8 - 2) * 3
x = 2 + 6 * 3
x = 2 + 18
x = 20
```

Therefore, the new variable `x` is `20`.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `n` must be greater than `j_old + 2`, `j` is `j_old + 1`, `i` is `n - 2 - j_old`, `x` is `20`**

In natural language: The output state includes the original lists `A` and `idx_A`, the conditions on `n` and `j_old`, the derived value of `j`, the derived value of `i`, and the newly calculated value of `x` which is `20`.
