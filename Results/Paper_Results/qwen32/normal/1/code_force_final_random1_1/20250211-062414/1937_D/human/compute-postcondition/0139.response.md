To determine what will be printed by the `print(i + 1, end=' ')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the provided information step-by-step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `A = [0, 1, 3]`
   - `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
   - `B = [0, 1, 3]`
   - `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`
   - `i` is incremented by 1
   - `r` is decreased by 1

2. **Analysis:**
   - The lists `A` and `B` are both `[0, 1, 3]`.
   - The lists `idx_A` and `idx_B` are `[3, 4, 5]` and `[2, 1, 0]` respectively.
   - `n` is mentioned to be greater than 0 but its exact value is not specified.
   - The variable `s[i]` is mentioned to be either `'>'` or not `'>'`, but its exact value is not provided.
   - The variable `i` is incremented by 1, meaning it was initially some value and then increased by 1.
   - The variable `r` is decreased by 1, but its exact value is not relevant to the current print statement.

3. **Focus on the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(i + 1, end=' ')`.
   - This means the output will be the value of `i + 1` followed by a space.

4. **Determine the Value of `i`:**
   - The problem states that `i` is incremented by 1, but it does not specify the initial value of `i`.
   - Without knowing the initial value of `i`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `i + 1`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the initial value of `i` is not provided, we can only express the output in terms of `i`.

Given this analysis, the output will be `i + 1` where `i` is the value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1.

Output: **i + 1 (where i is the value of i after it has been incremented by 1)**
