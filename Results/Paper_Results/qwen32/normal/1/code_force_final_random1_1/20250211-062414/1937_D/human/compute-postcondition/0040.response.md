Postcondition: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i = n - 1 - j`. If `s[i] == '<'`, then `B` becomes `[0]` if `len(idx_B)` was initially 0, otherwise `B` remains unchanged, and `idx_B` contains all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i`. If `s[i] != '<'`, `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged.**
