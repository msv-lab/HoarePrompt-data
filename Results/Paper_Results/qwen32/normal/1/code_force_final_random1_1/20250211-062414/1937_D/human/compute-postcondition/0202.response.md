To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration based on the given conditions and the initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
- `B = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`
- `l = 0`
- `r = 3`
- `n` (the number of iterations) is not explicitly provided but can be inferred from the sequence of operations.

### Iteration Analysis:
#### Iteration 1:
- Assume `s[0] == '>'` (since the first output state shows `l` incremented).
- `l < r` is true (`0 < 3`).
- `a = A[l] = A[0] = 0`
- `x = r - (l + 2) = 3 - (0 + 2) = 1`
- `b = B[r - 1] = B[2] = 3`
- Since `x >= 0`, update `b`:
  - `b = b - B[x] = 3 - B[1] = 3 - 1 = 2`
  - `b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) = 2 - (idx_B[1] - idx_B[2]) * (1 + 1) = 2 - (1 - 0) * 2 = 2 - 2 = 0`
- Update `b` again:
  - `b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1) = (idx_B[2] - 0) * (0 + 1) = 0 * 1 = 0`
- Print: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 = 0 * 2 + 0 * 2 + 0 + 1 = 1`
- Increment `l`: `l = 1`

#### Iteration 2:
- Assume `s[1] == '>'` (since the second output state shows `l` incremented).
- `l < r` is true (`1 < 3`).
- `a = A[l] = A[1] = 1`
- `x = r - (l + 2) = 3 - (1 + 2) = 0`
- `b = B[r - 1] = B[2] = 3`
- Since `x >= 0`, update `b`:
  - `b = b - B[x] = 3 - B[0] = 3 - 0 = 3`
  - `b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) = 3 - (idx_B[0] - idx_B[2]) * (0 + 1) = 3 - (2 - 0) * 1 = 3 - 2 = 1`
- Update `b` again:
  - `b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1) = (idx_B[2] - 1) * (1 + 1) = 0 * 2 = 0`
- Print: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 = 1 * 2 + 0 * 2 + 1 + 1 = 4`
- Increment `l`: `l = 2`

#### Iteration 3:
- Assume `s[2] == '>'` (since the third output state shows `l` incremented).
- `l < r` is true (`2 < 3`).
- `a = A[l] = A[2] = 3`
- `x = r - (l + 2) = 3 - (2 + 2) = -1`
- `b = B[r - 1] = B[2] = 3`
- Since `x < 0`, do not update `b` further.
- Update `b` again:
  - `b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1) = (idx_B[2] - 2) * (2 + 1) = 0 * 3 = 0`
- Print: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 = 3 * 2 + 0 * 2 + 2 + 1 = 9`
- Increment `l`: `l = 3`

### Final State:
After these iterations, `l` has reached `3`, which equals `r`. Therefore, no further iterations will occur since the condition `l < r` is no longer satisfied.

### Output State:
Output State: **A = [0, 1, 3], idx_A = [3, 4, 5], B = [0, 1, 3], idx_B = [2, 1, 0], l = 3, r = 3**

In natural language, the final state indicates that the lists `A` and `B`, along with their index lists `idx_A` and `idx_B`, remain unchanged. The pointers `l` and `r` both reach the value `3`, indicating that the loop terminates as there are no more elements to process according to the given conditions.
