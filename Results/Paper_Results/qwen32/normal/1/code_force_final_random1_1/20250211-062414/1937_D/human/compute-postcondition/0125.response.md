The given code snippet updates the value of `b` using the formula `b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. 

Given the initial state, the values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged. The value of `n` being greater than 0, `s[i]` being either `'>'` or not `'>'`, and `i` being incremented by 1 also remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code. The variables `a`, `x`, and the original definition of `b` are not affected by this particular line of code.

The new value of `b` is calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. Since `l` and `r` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `b`, but we can express it in terms of `l`, `r`, and `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is `A[l]` where `l` is an undefined index, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`**.
