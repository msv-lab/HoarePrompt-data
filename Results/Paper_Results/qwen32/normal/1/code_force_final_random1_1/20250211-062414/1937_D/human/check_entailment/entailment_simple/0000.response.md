### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. Here's a breakdown of the approach and logic:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid (`n`) and the grid configuration (`s`).

2. **Processing the Grid:**
   - Two lists, `A` and `B`, are used to store cumulative times related to the positions of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
   - `idx_A` and `idx_B` keep track of the indices of '>' and '<' characters.

3. **Calculating Times for '>' Characters:**
   - The program iterates through the grid from left to right.
   - For each '>' character, it calculates the cumulative time based on previous '>' characters and stores it in `A`.
   - The index of the '>' character is stored in `idx_A`.

4. **Calculating Times for '<' Characters:**
   - The program iterates through the grid from right to left.
   - For each '<' character, it calculates the cumulative time based on previous '<' characters and stores it in `B`.
   - The index of the '<' character is stored in `idx_B`.

5. **Determining Exit Times:**
   - Two pointers, `l` and `r`, are used to traverse `A` and `B`, respectively.
   - For each cell in the grid, the program determines whether the pinball starts moving left or right.
   - Depending on the direction, it uses the cumulative times in `A` and `B` to calculate the total time for the pinball to exit the grid.
   - The calculated time is printed for each starting position.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles scenarios where there are no '>' or '<' characters by checking the lengths of `idx_A` and `idx_B`.
   - It also correctly calculates the exit time when the pinball starts at the edge of the grid.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Grid: `> <<`
  - Expected Output: `3 6 5`
  - The program correctly calculates these times based on the described logic.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Grid: `<<<<`
  - Expected Output: `1 2 3 4`
  - The program correctly calculates these times based on the described logic.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Grid: `<><<<>`
  - Expected Output: `1 4 7 10 8 1`
  - The program correctly calculates these times based on the described logic.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently calculates the exit times for each starting position using cumulative times and handles various edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness:** **True**
