### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a grid where each cell contains either '<' or '>'. The pinball moves according to the direction indicated by the character in the cell, and the character inverts after the pinball moves through it. The goal is to calculate how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

The provided code attempts to solve this problem using a more optimized approach rather than simulating the movement for each starting position individually. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialization**: The code initializes two lists, `A` and `B`, which store cumulative distances related to the positions of '>' and '<' respectively. It also maintains index lists `idx_A` and `idx_B` to keep track of the positions of '>' and '<'.

2. **Processing '>' Characters**:
   - For each position `i` in the string `s`, if the character is '>', it calculates a cumulative distance based on previous positions of '>' stored in `idx_A`. This distance is stored in `A`.

3. **Processing '<' Characters**:
   - Similarly, for each position `i` in the string `s`, if the character is '<', it calculates a cumulative distance based on previous positions of '<' stored in `idx_B`. This distance is stored in `B`.

4. **Calculating Output**:
   - For each position `i` in the string `s`, the code calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid based on whether the character at that position is '>' or '<'. It uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to derive the result efficiently.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as when there are no '>' or '<' characters in the string.

The logic appears to be correct based on the problem requirements. The code efficiently calculates the required times without simulating the pinball movement for each starting position individually, which would be computationally expensive given the constraints.

### Correctness:

Given the detailed analysis and the fact that the logic aligns with the problem requirements, the provided program seems to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
