The code snippet provided calculates the value of `x` using the expression `r - (l + 2)`. However, the variables `r` and `l` are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `x`. The only change in the state is the introduction of the variable `x` with the expression `r - (l + 2)`.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 1, `a` is 1, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**.
