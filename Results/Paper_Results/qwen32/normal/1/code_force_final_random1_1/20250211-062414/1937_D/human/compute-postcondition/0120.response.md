The code snippet provided is `x = r - (l + 2)`. This line calculates the value of `x` based on the values of `r` and `l`. Since the values of `r` and `l` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `x`. However, we can express `x` in terms of `r` and `l`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is `A[l]` where `l` is an undefined index, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**

In natural language: The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `s[i]`, and `a` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1. The variable `x` is calculated as `r - (l + 2)`, where `r` and `l` are not specified in the initial state.
