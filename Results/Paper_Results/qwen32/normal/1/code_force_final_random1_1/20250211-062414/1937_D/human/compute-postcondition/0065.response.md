The code assigns the value of `B[r - 1]` to the variable `b`. Given the initial state, `r` is 3, so `r - 1` equals 2. Therefore, `b` is assigned the value of `B[2]`, which is 3.

Other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `l = 0`, `r = 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is `'>'`, `a = 0`, `x = 1`, `b = 3`**
