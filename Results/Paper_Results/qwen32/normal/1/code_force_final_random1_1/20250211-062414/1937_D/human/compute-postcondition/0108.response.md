Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `A = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`
- `B = [0, 1, 3]`
- `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`
- `l = 0`
- `r = 2`
- `a = 3`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`
- `l` is greater than `r` (This condition is false as `l` is 0 and `r` is 2)
- `r` is not equal to `0`

Code Snippet:
```python
b = A[l - 1]
```

Since `l` is 0, `l - 1` evaluates to `-1`. In Python, accessing `A[-1]` retrieves the last element of the list `A`, which is `3`.

Thus, `b` is assigned the value `3`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_A = [3, 4, 5]`, `B = [0, 1, 3]`, `idx_B = [2, 1, 0]`, `l = 0`, `r = 2`, `a = 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`, `l` is greater than `r` (False), `r` is not equal to `0`, `b = 3`**
