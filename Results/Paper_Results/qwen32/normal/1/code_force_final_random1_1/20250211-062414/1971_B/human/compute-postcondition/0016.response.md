Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a newly input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the length of `a` is 2, then the program continues as specified in the if part. Otherwise, `b` is the string `s` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the string `s` sorted in descending order, and if `s` is already sorted in ascending order (`b == s`), then `s` remains equal to `b`; otherwise, `b` is not equal to `s`.**
