Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the newly input string, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, and `i` is 4. If the length of `a` is 2, the program does not modify any additional variables. Otherwise, `b` is the sorted string of `s`, and `c` is the sorted string of `s` in reverse order, with the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remaining unchanged.**
