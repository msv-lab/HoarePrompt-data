Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the newly input string, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, `i` is 4, `b` is the sorted string of `s`, and `c` is the sorted string of `s` in reverse order. Regardless of whether `b` equals `s` or not, the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.**
