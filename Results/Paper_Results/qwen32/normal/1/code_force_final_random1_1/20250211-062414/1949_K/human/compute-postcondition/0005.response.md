The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which is the loop variable iterating over the list `numbers`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state and how it evolves as the loop progresses.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`.
- `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.
- `group_a` contains `num` (from the previous iteration).
- `group_b` and `group_c` are empty lists.
- `sum_a` is `num` (from the previous iteration).
- `sum_b` is 0.
- `sum_c` is 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was the first element of `numbers`, and it has been added to `group_a` and its value has been added to `sum_a`.

For the next iteration, `num` should be the next element in `numbers`. Since `numbers` is sorted in descending order, the next `num` will be the second element in the list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `num` will be the second element of `numbers`.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop header.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `group_a` contains the first element of `numbers`, `group_b` and `group_c` are empty lists, `sum_a` is the first element of `numbers`, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `num` is the second element of `numbers`**.
