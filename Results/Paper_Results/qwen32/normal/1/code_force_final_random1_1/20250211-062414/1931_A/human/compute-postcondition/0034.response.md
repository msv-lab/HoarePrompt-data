Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and prints a specific string based on the value of `n`. The printed string is determined by whether `n` is greater than 52, between 27 and 52, or between 3 and 26. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.**
