You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, printing a `word` for each input `n` according to the specified conditions. The variable `t` is now 0, and `i` is equal to the initial value of `t`. The `alphabet` string remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and prints a specific string based on the value of `n`. The printed string is determined by whether `n` is greater than 52, between 27 and 52, or between 3 and 26. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 lowercase Latin letters that corresponds to a given encoded integer `n`. The encoding is done by summing the positions of the letters in the alphabet (where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26).

### Key Points:
- The word consists of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters.
- The encoded value `n` ranges from 3 to 78.
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest word that sums up to `n`.

### Approach:
To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should try to use the smallest possible letters first. Here's how the approach should work:
- Start with the smallest letter 'a' (position 1) and see if we can complete the sum with two other letters.
- If not, increment the first letter and try again.
- Continue this process until we find the correct combination.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution uses a different approach to construct the word:
- If `n > 52`, it constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
- If `n > 26`, it constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
- Otherwise, it constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

#### Let's Test the Provided Solution with Example Cases:
1. **For `n = 24`:**
   - According to the provided solution, since `n > 26` is false and `n > 52` is false, it will choose `'aa' + alphabet[24 - 3]` which is `'aa' + 'r'` resulting in `'aar'`.
   - However, the correct answer should be `'aav'` because `'aav'` is lexicographically smaller than `'aar'`.

2. **For `n = 70`:**
   - According to the provided solution, since `n > 52` is true, it will choose `alphabet[70 - 53] + 'zz'` which is `'r' + 'zz'` resulting in `'rzz'`.
   - This is correct.

3. **For `n = 3`:**
   - According to the provided solution, since `n > 26` is false and `n > 52` is false, it will choose `'aa' + alphabet[3 - 3]` which is `'aa' + 'a'` resulting in `'aaa'`.
   - This is correct.

4. **For `n = 55`:**
   - According to the provided solution, since `n > 26` is true and `n > 52` is false, it will choose `'a' + alphabet[55 - 28] + 'z'` which is `'a' + 'p' + 'z'` resulting in `'apz'`.
   - However, the correct answer should be `'czz'` because `'czz'` is lexicographically smaller than `'apz'`.

5. **For `n = 48`:**
   - According to the provided solution, since `n > 26` is true and `n > 52` is false, it will choose `'a' + alphabet[48 - 28] + 'z'` which is `'a' + 'u' + 'z'` resulting in `'auz'`.
   - This is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word. It fails for some test cases like `n = 24` and `n = 55`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
