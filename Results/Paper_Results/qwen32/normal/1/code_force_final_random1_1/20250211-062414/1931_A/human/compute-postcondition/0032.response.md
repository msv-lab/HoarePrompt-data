To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each input value of `n` and constructs the corresponding `word` based on the given conditions. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the initial number of test cases provided as input.

Here's a breakdown of how the loop operates:
- For each iteration, it reads an integer `n`.
- Depending on the value of `n`, it constructs a string `word`:
  - If `n > 52`, `word` becomes `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
  - If `27 ≤ n ≤ 52`, `word` becomes `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
  - If `1 ≤ n ≤ 26`, `word` becomes `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

After processing all `t` inputs, the loop ends, and no further changes are made to the variables outside the loop.

### Final Output State:
The final output state includes:
- The variable `t` will be 0 because the loop has completed all `t` iterations.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `t` because `i` is incremented once per loop iteration.
- The variable `alphabet` remains unchanged as it is a constant string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
- The variable `word` will hold the value constructed during the last iteration of the loop.

However, since the question asks for the overall output state after all iterations, and since `word` is printed during each iteration rather than stored for the final state, the final output state can be described as the completion of the loop with all outputs printed.

Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, printing a `word` for each input `n` according to the specified conditions. The variable `t` is now 0, and `i` is equal to the initial value of `t`. The `alphabet` string remains unchanged.**
