### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and verify if it correctly determines the lexicographically smallest word for each given encoded value `n`.

1. **Understanding the Encoding Scheme**:
   - Each letter is mapped to its position in the alphabet (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).
   - A 3-letter word is encoded as the sum of these positions.

2. **Constraints**:
   - The encoded value `n` ranges from 3 to 78.
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to `n`.

3. **Logic of the Program**:
   - The program uses a series of conditional checks to determine the smallest possible word:
     - If `n > 52`, it constructs a word of the form `[letter]zz`, where `[letter]` is the letter corresponding to `n - 53`.
     - If `27 <= n <= 52`, it constructs a word of the form `a[letter]z`, where `[letter]` is the letter corresponding to `n - 28`.
     - If `3 <= n <= 26`, it constructs a word of the form `aa[letter]`, where `[letter]` is the letter corresponding to `n - 3`.

4. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For `n = 24`:
     - Since `24 > 26` but `24 <= 52`, the word should be of the form `a[letter]z`.
     - `n - 28 = -4`, which is incorrect. Instead, we should use `n - 27 = -3`, which is still incorrect. The correct approach is to use `n - 27 = -3 + 26 = 23` (since we need a positive index), which gives us the letter `w` (23rd letter). However, the program seems to use `n - 28`, which would give `x` (24th letter), leading to `axz`. But the correct answer is `aav`, indicating an error in the logic.
   - For `n = 70`:
     - Since `70 > 52`, the word should be of the form `[letter]zz`.
     - `n - 53 = 17`, which corresponds to the letter `q`. So the word is `qzz`.
     - This matches the expected output `rzz`, indicating an error in the logic.
   - For `n = 3`:
     - Since `3 <= 26`, the word should be of the form `aa[letter]`.
     - `n - 3 = 0`, which corresponds to the letter `a`. So the word is `aaa`.
     - This matches the expected output `aaa`.
   - For `n = 55`:
     - Since `55 > 52`, the word should be of the form `[letter]zz`.
     - `n - 53 = 2`, which corresponds to the letter `b`. So the word is `bzz`.
     - This does not match the expected output `czz`, indicating an error in the logic.
   - For `n = 48`:
     - Since `48 > 52` is false and `48 > 26` is true, the word should be of the form `a[letter]z`.
     - `n - 28 = 20`, which corresponds to the letter `t`. So the word is `atz`.
     - This does not match the expected output `auz`, indicating an error in the logic.

From the above analysis, it is clear that the logic used in the program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for all values of `n`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
