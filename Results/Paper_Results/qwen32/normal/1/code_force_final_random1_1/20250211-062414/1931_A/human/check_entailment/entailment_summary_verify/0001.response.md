### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided solution against the problem requirements and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums to a given integer `n`.
- The sum `n` ranges from 3 to 78.
- The letters are indexed from 1 ('a') to 26 ('z').

#### Provided Solution:
The solution uses a straightforward conditional approach to determine the word based on the value of `n`:
- If `n > 52`, it constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
- If `n > 26`, it constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
- Otherwise, it constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

#### Evaluation Against Test Cases:
1. **For `n = 24`:**
   - The solution computes `'aa' + alphabet[24 - 3]` which results in `'aa' + 'r'` or `'aar'`.
   - The correct answer is `'aav'` because `'aav'` is lexicographically smaller than `'aar'`.

2. **For `n = 70`:**
   - The solution computes `alphabet[70 - 53] + 'zz'` which results in `'r' + 'zz'` or `'rzz'`.
   - This is correct.

3. **For `n = 3`:**
   - The solution computes `'aa' + alphabet[3 - 3]` which results in `'aa' + 'a'` or `'aaa'`.
   - This is correct.

4. **For `n = 55`:**
   - The solution computes `'a' + alphabet[55 - 28] + 'z'` which results in `'a' + 'p' + 'z'` or `'apz'`.
   - The correct answer is `'czz'` because `'czz'` is lexicographically smaller than `'apz'`.

5. **For `n = 48`:**
   - The solution computes `'a' + alphabet[48 - 28] + 'z'` which results in `'a' + 'u' + 'z'` or `'auz'`.
   - This is correct.

#### Correct Approach:
To ensure the solution is correct, we need to find the lexicographically smallest combination of three letters that sum to `n`. This involves iterating through possible combinations starting from the smallest letters and checking their sums.

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when the correct word is not directly derived from the simple conditional logic. For instance, it fails for `n = 24` and `n = 55` as demonstrated above.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
