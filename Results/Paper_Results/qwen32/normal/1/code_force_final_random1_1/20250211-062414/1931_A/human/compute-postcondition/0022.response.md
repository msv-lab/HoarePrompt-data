To determine the output of the `print(word)` statement, let's analyze the conditions and the value of `n`:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `n` is the integer value provided by the user input.
   - `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the given code snippet).

2. **Conditions for `word`:**
   - If `n` > 52, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
   - If 27 ≤ `n` ≤ 52, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - If 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]'`.

Let's break down the logic for different ranges of `n`:

- **For `n` > 52:**
  - `word` = `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`
  - Since `alphabet` contains only 26 letters, `n - 53` must be adjusted to fit within the range of indices for `alphabet`. However, the given formula suggests that `n - 53` would be negative or out of bounds, which doesn't align with the typical usage. Assuming the intention was to wrap around, this case isn't straightforward without additional context. For now, we'll consider it as described.

- **For 27 ≤ `n` ≤ 52:**
  - `word` = `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`
  - Here, `n - 28` will give us an index between 0 and 24 (inclusive), which is valid for `alphabet`.

- **For 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26:**
  - `word` = `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]'`
  - Here, `n - 3` will give us an index between -2 and 23 (inclusive). Since negative indices are allowed in Python but refer to elements from the end of the list, `n - 3` should be non-negative for valid results. Thus, `n` should be at least 3 for valid indexing.

Given these conditions, let's formulate the output based on the possible values of `n`:

- If `n` > 52, `word` = `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` (assuming valid wrapping or special handling).
- If 27 ≤ `n` ≤ 52, `word` = `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
- If 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 26, `word` = `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]'`.
- If `n` = 1 or 2, the formula for `word` does not apply directly, so we need to handle these cases separately or assume they are invalid per the given logic.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we will describe the output in terms of `n`:

Output: **word (where word is determined by the value of n: if n > 52, word = alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'; if 27 ≤ n ≤ 52, word = 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'; if 3 ≤ n ≤ 26, word = 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3])**
