The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. Given that the input to `int(input())` is specified as `t`, the value of `n` will be updated to the value of `t`. The other variables (`t`, `alphabet`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is equal to `t`, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'**.
