The given code appends a calculated value to the list `array2`. Specifically, it calculates `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` and adds this value to `array2`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1
- `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1
- `f` is `feat[1]`
- `a` is `feat[2]`
- `b` is `feat[-1]`
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line
- `array2` is an empty list
- `i` is `x + 1`
- The current value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`

After executing the code `array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)`, the value of `array2` changes as it now includes the newly appended element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is a list containing one element `((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)`, `i` is `x + 1`.**
