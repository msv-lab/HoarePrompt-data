The code snippet `b = feat[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `feat` to the variable `b`. Given that `b` was already defined as `feat[-1]` in the initial state, the value of `b` does not change after this operation. Therefore, there is no change in the state of the variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `i` is 0.**
