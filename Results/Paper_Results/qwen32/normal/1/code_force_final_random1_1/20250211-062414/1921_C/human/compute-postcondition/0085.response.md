Postcondition: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 0, `array2` is either `[]` or `[arr[0] * a]` depending on whether `arr[0] < b / a`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a`, `test_cases` retain their initial states, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `i` is 0. If `arr[0] < b / a`, then `array2` is updated to `[arr[0] * a]`. Otherwise, `array2` remains `[]`.**
