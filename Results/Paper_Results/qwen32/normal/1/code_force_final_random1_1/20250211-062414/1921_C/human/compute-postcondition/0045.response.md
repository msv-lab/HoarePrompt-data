Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variable `t`:** An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **Variable `test_cases`:** Greater than or equal to 1.
3. **List `feat`:** A new list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `n = feat[0]`: Must be greater than 1.
   - `f = feat[1]`
   - `a = feat[2]`
   - `b = feat[-1]`
4. **List `arr`:** A list of integers obtained from the new input line.
5. **Variable `i`:** Set to `n`.
6. **List `array2`:** Contains all elements \((arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a\) where \(arr[i] - arr[i-1] < \frac{b}{a}\) for \(i\) ranging from 1 to \(n-1\).
7. **Condition:** The sum of `array2` plus \((n - \text{len}(\text{array2})) * b\) is less than `f`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet simply prints the string `'Yes'`. There are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement itself that would change the output based on the initial state provided.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
