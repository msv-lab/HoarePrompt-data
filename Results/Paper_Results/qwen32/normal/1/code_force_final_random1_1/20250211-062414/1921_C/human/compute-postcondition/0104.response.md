Postcondition: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 0, `array2` contains elements based on the conditions `arr[0] * a` if `arr[0] < b / a` and `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i > 0` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a`, `test_cases`, and `b` retain their initial states, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, and `i` is equal to `n`. Additionally, the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`.**
