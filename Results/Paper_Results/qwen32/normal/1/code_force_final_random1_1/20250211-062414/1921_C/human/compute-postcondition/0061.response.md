The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is `feat[0]` (which is `feat[1]` from the previous iteration, but it should be `feat[0]` as per the description). For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.

Since `n` is already set to `feat[0]` (which is greater than 1), no adjustment is needed for `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input where `feat[0]` (which is `n`) must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line, `i` is 1. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains one element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.**
