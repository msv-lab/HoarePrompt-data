Postcondition: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 0, `array2` is either `[]` or contains one element `[arr[0] * a]` if `arr[0] < b / a`, or contains one additional element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `i != 0` and `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a`, `test_cases` retain their initial states, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, and `i` retains its value.**
