Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input where `feat[0]` (which is `n`) must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line, `i` is 2, `array2` includes the element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `i` remains 2. The list `array2` now contains one additional element, which is calculated as `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
