The initial state provides us with information about the variables `n` and `k`, which are the values returned by the function `func_4()`. It also specifies that the current value of `n` is 0. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. Instead, it directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the execution of the `print` statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
