The code snippet `l.pop(-1)` removes the last element from the list `l`. Given the initial state, the list `l` starts with 1, then `n`, and then contains integers from 2 to `n-1`. Therefore, the last element of `l` is `n-1`.

After executing `l.pop(-1)`, the list `l` will no longer contain the element `n-1`. Thus, the new list `l` will be `[1, n, 2, 3, ..., n-2]`.

The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `k` is `k - 3*i + 3`; `l` is a list starting with 1, then `n`, and then containing integers from 2 to `n-2`; `x` is `n-1`; `i` is `i`.**
