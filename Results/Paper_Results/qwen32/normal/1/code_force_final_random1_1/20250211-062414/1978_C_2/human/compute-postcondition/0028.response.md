To determine the new state after the given Python code executes, let's analyze the changes:

- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `i` remains `n - 4`.
- `k` remains `k - 2*n + 8`.
- `l` was initially the result of `func_3(2, l)`.
- `c` remains 3.

The line `l = func_3(c, l)` modifies the value of `l` by calling `func_3` with `c` (which is 3) and the current value of `l`. Since the function `func_3` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot compute the exact new value of `l`. However, we can express the new value of `l` as the result of `func_3(3, l)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 4`, `k` is `k - 2*n + 8`, `l` is the result of `func_3(3, l)`, `c` is 3**.
