Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `k`, a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). Depending on the value of `k`, the function returns different lists:

- Case_1: If `k` is 0, the function returns a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`.
- Case_2: If `k` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, the function returns a list `l` which contains integers from 1 to `n-1` with `n` inserted at position `-k`.
- Case_3: If `k` equals `n`, the function returns a list `l` that starts with `n` and then contains integers from 1 to `n-1`.
- Case_4: If `k` is greater than `n` and less than `2*n - 1`, the function returns a list `l` that starts with `n`, followed by integers from 2 to `n-1`, with `1` inserted at the position `-k` from the end of the list.
- Case_5: If `k` equals `2*n - 1`, the function returns the list [1, n, 2, 3, ..., n-1].
- Case_6: If `k` is greater than `2*n - 1`, the function returns a list `l` starting with 1, followed by `n`, then integers from 2 to `n-2`, and finally `n-1` inserted at the `-k` position, where `k` is adjusted as `k - 2*i + 2` and is not equal to 0.**
