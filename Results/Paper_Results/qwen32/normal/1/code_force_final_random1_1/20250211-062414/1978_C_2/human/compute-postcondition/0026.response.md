Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 4`, `k` is `k - n + 3`, `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, and `c` is 3. If `k < i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(3, k, l)`. If `k` is not less than `i - 1` and `k` equals 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(2, l)`.**
