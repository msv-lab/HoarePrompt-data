Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The logic used in the program is flawed, particularly in how it handles the overlap of fireworks from both installations and the conditions under which additional fireworks might be counted.

Here's why the current solution is incorrect:

1. **Overlap Handling**: The program calculates `mn` as `min(a, b) + m`, but this doesn't necessarily give the correct point where the maximum overlap occurs. The maximum overlap can happen at multiples of the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` within the visibility window.

2. **Condition for Additional Firework**: The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)` is too restrictive and does not correctly identify when an additional firework should be counted. Specifically, it fails to account for cases where fireworks from different installations overlap perfectly.

3. **General Approach**: To solve this problem correctly, one needs to find the LCM of `a` and `b` and then determine how many fireworks from each installation are visible at any given time, especially around the LCM multiples. The correct approach involves iterating through potential overlap points and counting the fireworks accordingly.

A correct solution would involve more sophisticated handling of the LCM and the visibility intervals, ensuring that all overlaps are considered accurately.
