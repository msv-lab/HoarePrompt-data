The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. This means the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are overwritten by the new values read from the input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input
- `mn` is `min(a, b) + m`
- There is a condition about divisibility involving `a`, `b`, and `m`
- `i` is 1

After executing the code snippet `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())`, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the new values read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `mn`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a`, `b`, and `m` are the new integers read from the input; `mn` is `min(a, b) + m`; if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1, then `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1. Otherwise, it is not the case that `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, or at least one of `a` or `b` is equal to 1; `i` is 1.**
