The code assigns the value of `min(a, b) + m` to the variable `mn`. This means `mn` will hold the smaller value between `a` and `b`, plus `m`.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged except for the introduction of `mn`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `mn` is `min(a, b) + m`.**
