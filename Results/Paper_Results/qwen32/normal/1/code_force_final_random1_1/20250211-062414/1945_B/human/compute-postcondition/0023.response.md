Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates a value based on these integers and prints the result. Specifically, it computes `mn` as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`, and then prints either `mn // a + mn // b + 1` if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, or `mn // a + mn // b` otherwise.**
