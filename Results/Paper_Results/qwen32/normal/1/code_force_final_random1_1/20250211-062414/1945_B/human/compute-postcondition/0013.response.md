To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Variables and their definitions**:
   - `t`: An input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a`, `b`, and `m`: New integers read from the input.
   - `mn`: Calculated as `min(a, b) + m`.
   - The condition checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1. This condition doesn't directly affect the calculation in the print statement but might influence the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Expression to be evaluated**:
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `mn // a + mn // b`.
   - Here, `mn // a` is the integer division of `mn` by `a`, and `mn // b` is the integer division of `mn` by `b`.

3. **Substituting the value of `mn`**:
   - Since `mn = min(a, b) + m`, we substitute this into the expression:
     \[
     \text{print}((\min(a, b) + m) // a + (\min(a, b) + m) // b)
     \]

4. **Explanation of the output**:
   - The output will be the result of the expression \((\min(a, b) + m) // a + (\min(a, b) + m) // b\).
   - This means we need to compute the integer divisions of `mn` by `a` and `b` and then sum these results.

Given the above steps, the precise output depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `m`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(\(\min(a, b) + m\) // a) + (\(\min(a, b) + m\) // b)** (where `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers read from the input)
