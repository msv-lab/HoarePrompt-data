Let's break down the problem step by step using the given initial state:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: An input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable does not affect the print statement directly.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m`: Integers read from the input.
   - `mn`: Calculated as `min(a, b) + m`.
   - `i`: Set to 2. This variable also does not affect the print statement directly.
   
2. **Condition:**
   - If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1, then the condition is true.
   - Otherwise, the condition is false.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)`.
   - Here, `mn // a` is the integer division of `mn` by `a`.
   - `mn // b` is the integer division of `mn` by `b`.
   - Adding 1 to the sum of these two divisions gives the final result.

4. **Calculation:**
   - `mn` is `min(a, b) + m`.
   - The expression `mn // a` computes how many times `a` fits into `mn`.
   - The expression `mn // b` computes how many times `b` fits into `mn`.
   - Adding 1 to the sum of these two results provides the final output.

Given this information, the output of the print statement can be described precisely as follows:

Output: **(min(a, b) + m) // a + (min(a, b) + m) // b + 1**
