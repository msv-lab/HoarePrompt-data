Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `mn` is defined as `min(a, b) + m`.
- It is guaranteed that `m` is not divisible by both `a` and `b`, or at least one of `a` or `b` is equal to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(mn // a + mn // b)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `mn`:**
   - `mn` is calculated as `min(a, b) + m`.
   - `min(a, b)` gives the smaller of the two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Calculate `mn // a`:**
   - This is the integer division of `mn` by `a`, which means it will give the quotient when `mn` is divided by `a` without considering the remainder.

3. **Calculate `mn // b`:**
   - Similarly, this is the integer division of `mn` by `b`.

4. **Sum the Results:**
   - The final result to be printed is the sum of `mn // a` and `mn // b`.

### Explanation of Output:
- Since `mn = min(a, b) + m`, the expression `mn // a + mn // b` can be understood as the sum of how many times `a` fits into `mn` and how many times `b` fits into `mn`.
- Given the constraints and the fact that `m` is not divisible by both `a` and `b` or at least one of them is 1, the exact numerical value cannot be determined without specific values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
- However, the formula `mn // a + mn // b` precisely describes what will be printed.

### Final Output:
Output: **mn // a + mn // b (where mn is min(a, b) + m)**
