The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. This means the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are overwritten by the new input values. The variables `t`, `mn`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `mn` is `min(a, b) + m`; `i` is 2. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1, then `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1. Otherwise, it is not the case that `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, or at least one of `a` or `b` is equal to 1.**
