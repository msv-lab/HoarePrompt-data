Let's break down the given initial state and determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Input Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `n`, `k`, `q`: Integers read from the input, with `q > 0`.
   - `a`: A list starting with 0, followed by integers read from the input.
   - `b`: A list starting with 0, followed by integers read from the input.

2. **Derived Lists:**
   - `ad`: Differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
     - For example, if `a = [0, 2, 5, 9]`, then `ad = [0, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - `bd`: Differences between consecutive elements of `b`.
     - For example, if `b = [0, 3, 6, 12]`, then `bd = [0, 3, 3, 6]`.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `i`: Set to 1.
   - `v`: A list constructed as `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`.
     - Continuing the example above, `v = [0, 2/3, 1, 2/3]`.
   - `l` and `m`: Both set to 0.
   - `ql`: Another integer read from the input.
   - `s`: The index found by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, which means `s` is the position where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` without disrupting the order.
   - `a[s]` is explicitly stated to be equal to `ql`, meaning `ql` is an exact match for one of the elements in `a`.

### Key Points:

- The `bisect_left(a, ql)` function returns the index `s` such that `a[s] == ql`.
- Since `a[s] == ql`, this implies that `ql` is one of the elements in the list `a`.

### What Will Be Printed:

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(b[s], end=' ')
```

- `b[s]` refers to the element in list `b` at the same index `s` where `ql` is located in list `a`.

### Conclusion:

Given that `a[s] == ql`, the value printed will be `b[s]`, which is the element in list `b` at the same index where `ql` is found in list `a`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **b[s] (where s is the index such that a[s] == ql)**
