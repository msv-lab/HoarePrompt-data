Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t` is `t - 1` (Note: This doesn't affect the current state since `t` is not used further in the provided context).
   - `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input.
   - `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the new integers read from the input.
   - `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the new integers read from the input.
   - `ad` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting with 0.
     - `ad = [0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]]`
   - `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting with 0.
     - `bd = [0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]]`
   - `i` is initialized to 1.
   - `v` is a list of ratios of corresponding elements of `ad` and `bd` starting with 0.
     - `v = [0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`
   - `l` is initialized to 1.
   - `m` is initialized to 0.
   - `ql` is a new integer read from the input.
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted into `a` to maintain sorted order.
     - If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the state remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(b[s], end=' ')`.

### Determining the Output:

- The variable `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted into `a` to maintain sorted order.
- Since `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers, `b[s]` refers to the element in `b` at the same index `s` where `ql` would be inserted into `a`.

### Explanation:

- The value of `b[s]` depends on the position of `ql` in the sorted list `a`.
- If `ql` is already present in `a` at index `s`, then `b[s]` is simply the element in `b` at that index.
- If `ql` is not present in `a` but would be inserted at index `s`, then `b[s]` is still the element in `b` at that index, which is determined by the sorted order of `a`.

### Final Output:

Given the information provided, the output of the print statement will be the element in the list `b` at the index `s`, where `s` is the insertion point of `ql` in the sorted list `a`.

Output: **b[s] (where s is the index where ql would be inserted into a to maintain sorted order)**
