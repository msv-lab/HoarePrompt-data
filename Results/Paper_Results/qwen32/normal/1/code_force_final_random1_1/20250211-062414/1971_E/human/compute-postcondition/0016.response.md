The code appends the difference between the second and first elements of list `b` to list `bd`. Since `bd` initially contains only one element (0), after the operation, `bd` will contain two elements: the initial 0 and the newly calculated difference.

Given that `b` starts with at least one more integer after the initial 0, `b[i] - b[i - 1]` translates to `b[1] - b[0]`.

Therefore, the updated state of `bd` will be `[0, b[1] - b[0]]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by at least one more integer, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing the elements [0, b[1] - b[0]], `i` is 1**.
