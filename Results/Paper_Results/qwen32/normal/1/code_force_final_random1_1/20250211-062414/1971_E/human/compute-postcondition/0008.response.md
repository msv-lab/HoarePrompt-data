The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i-1]` to the list `ad`. Given the initial state, `ad` initially contains only the element `0`. After executing the code, `ad` will contain two elements: the initial `0` and the newly appended difference.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list with at least two elements (starting with 0 and followed by at least one integer read from the input); `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input; `ad` is a list containing the elements `[0, a[i] - a[i - 1]]`; `bd` is a list containing the single element 0.**
