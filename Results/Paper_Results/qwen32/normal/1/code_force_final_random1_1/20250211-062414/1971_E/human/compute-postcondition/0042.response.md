To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant computations step-by-step.

### Initial State Recap
- `t`: An input integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `n`, `k`, `q`: Integers read from the input with `q > 0`.
- `a`: A list starting with 0 followed by integers read from the input.
- `b`: A list starting with 0 followed by integers read from the input.
- `ad`: A list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
- `bd`: A list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `b`.
- `i`: Set to 1.
- `v`: A list containing the elements `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`.
- `l`: Set to 0.
- `m`: Initially not explicitly set, but updated by `m = m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- `ql`: Initially not explicitly set, but updated by `ql = ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s`: The index found by `bisect_left(a, ql)`.

### Key Computations
The variable `m` is updated using the formula:
\[ m = m + b[s - 1] + \frac{bd[s] \times ql}{ad[s]} \]

Where:
- `s` is determined by finding the smallest index in `a` such that `a[s] >= ql`.
- `ql` is initially not specified but is updated by subtracting `a[s - 1]` from it.

### Output Analysis
The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer value of `m`.

However, without specific values for `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `m`, `ql`, and the sequence of operations leading up to the point of printing, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`. 

Given the information provided, we can describe the output in terms of the variables involved:

### Final Answer
Output: **int(m) (where m is computed based on the updates involving b[s - 1], bd[s], ql, and ad[s])**
