Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the new integers read from the input, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the new integers read from the input, `ad` is [0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]], `bd` is [0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]], `i` is 1, `v` is [0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]], `l` is 1, `m` is 0, `ql` is the new integer read from the input, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted into `a` to maintain sorted order. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the state remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change any of the variables or their values. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
