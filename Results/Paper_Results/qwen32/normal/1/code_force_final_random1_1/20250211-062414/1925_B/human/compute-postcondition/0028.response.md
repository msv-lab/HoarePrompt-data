The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `ans`. This means that the previous value of `ans` (which was the maximum divisor of `x` that satisfied the given conditions) is now overwritten with `1`. The values of `q`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is 1, `x` is `input_x`, `n` is `input_n`, and `ans` is 1.**
