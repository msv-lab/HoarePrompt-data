The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 4, and it must still be within the range `[1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1]`.

State: **`q` is 3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 4**
