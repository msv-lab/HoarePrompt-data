The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts these parts to integers, and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. Given that `input()` returns `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `t` is a string containing two space-separated integers. After the execution of the code, `x` and `n` will hold these two integer values respectively.

Output State: **`q` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input.**
