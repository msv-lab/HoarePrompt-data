Postcondition: **`q` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and is greater than 0, `n` is the second integer from the input, and `ans` is updated to `max(ans, x // i)` if `x` is divisible by `i`, `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`, `x // i > 0`, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
