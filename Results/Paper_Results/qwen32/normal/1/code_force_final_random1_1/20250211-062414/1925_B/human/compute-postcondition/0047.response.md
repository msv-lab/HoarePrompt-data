The given code snippet updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the result of `x // i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, and `x` is `input_x`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be the maximum of its previous value and `input_x // 3`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is 1, `x` is `input_x`, `n` is `input_n`, `i` is 3, `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 2, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `input_x // 3`.**
