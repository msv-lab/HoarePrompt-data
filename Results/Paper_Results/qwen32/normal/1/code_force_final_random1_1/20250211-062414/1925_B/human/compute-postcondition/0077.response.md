To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code snippet:

- `q` is set to 2.
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `n` is the second integer from the input.
- `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies certain conditions (though the specific conditions are not detailed in the initial state).

Given the current information, we know that `ans` is determined based on some criteria related to `x`. However, since the specific conditions are not provided, we can only describe `ans` in terms of its definition.

The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the largest divisor of `x` satisfying the given conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that satisfies the given conditions)**
