To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `q` is 0.
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `n` is the second integer from the input.
- `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that satisfies certain conditions.

### Given Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `ans` is described as "the maximum divisor of `x` that satisfies the given conditions." However, the specific conditions are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans` without knowing these conditions.
- Since the conditions are not specified, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the conditions it must satisfy.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the maximum divisor of `x` that meets the specified conditions, but since the conditions are not provided, we cannot specify a numerical value for `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum divisor of x that satisfies the given conditions)**
