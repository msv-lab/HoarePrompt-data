Output State: **`q` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and is greater than 0, `n` is the second integer from the input, `ans` is `max(1, i)`, and `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `(x - n * i) % i` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (which is 1) and the value of `i`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
