To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the range parameters `1` and `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `q` is 1
- `x` is `input_x`
- `n` is `input_n`
- `i` is 2

The for loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Loop Variable (`i`)**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 3.

2. **Range Parameters**:
   - The range starts from 1 and goes up to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
   - Since `i` is now 3, the condition `i < int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must hold true for the loop to continue executing.
   - Therefore, `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be greater than 3, implying `int(sqrt(x))` must be at least 2.

### Adjusted State:

- `i` should be 3.
- `x` remains `input_x`.
- `n` remains `input_n`.
- `q` remains 1.
- The condition `int(sqrt(x)) + 1 > 3` must be satisfied, meaning `int(sqrt(x)) >= 2`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`q` is 1, `x` is `input_x`, `n` is `input_n`, `i` is 3, `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 2**.
