The code snippet `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the variable `ans` to be the maximum value between its current value and the value of `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2. However, the initial value of `ans` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `ans` after the operation. We can only say that `ans` will be at least 2.

Output State: **`q` is 1, `x` is `input_x`, `n` is `input_n`, `i` is 2, `ans` is the maximum of its initial value and 2.**
