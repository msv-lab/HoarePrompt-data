### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the logic of the provided program and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It also reads a list of `n` integers representing the moments `m_i` at which messages need to be sent.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `array2` to store the energy consumed due to the phone being on during intervals where it is not beneficial to turn the phone off and on.
   - It iterates through the list of moments `arr` and checks the difference between consecutive moments.
   - If the difference between two consecutive moments is less than `b / a`, it means that turning the phone off and on would consume more energy than keeping the phone on during that interval. Therefore, it appends the energy consumed during that interval to `array2`.

3. **Calculating Total Energy Consumption:**
   - The program calculates the total energy consumed by summing up the values in `array2` and adding the energy consumed due to turning the phone off and on for the remaining intervals. The energy consumed due to turning the phone off and on is `(n - len(array2)) * b`.
   - It then checks if this total energy consumption is less than the initial charge `f`.

4. **Output:**
   - If the total energy consumption is less than `f`, the program prints "Yes", indicating that Stepan can send all the messages without running out of charge.
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Issues in the Program:
- The condition `if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:` is incorrect. The correct condition should be `if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] * a < b:`. This is because the energy consumed by keeping the phone on for `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` units of time is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`, and we need to compare this with the energy consumed by turning the phone off and on, which is `b`.
- The logic for calculating the total energy consumption is flawed. The program should consider the energy consumed during the entire period from the start until the last message, taking into account the optimal strategy of turning the phone off and on.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the program, it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
