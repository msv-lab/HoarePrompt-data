Let's break down the initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
3. `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1.
   - `f` is `feat[1]`.
   - `a` is `feat[2]`.
   - `b` is `feat[-1]`.
4. `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line.
5. `i` is set to `n`.
6. `array2` contains all elements \((arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a\) where \(arr[i] - arr[i-1] < \frac{b}{a}\) for \(i\) ranging from 1 to \(n-1\).
7. The sum of `array2` plus \((n - \text{len}(\text{array2})) * b\) is greater than or equal to `f`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet simply prints the string `'No'`. There are no variables or conditions that affect the output of this specific print statement. The initial state provides context about the variables and lists involved, but they do not influence the execution of this particular print statement.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
