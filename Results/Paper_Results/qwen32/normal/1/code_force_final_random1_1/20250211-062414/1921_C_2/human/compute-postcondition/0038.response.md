Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1.
- `f` is `feat[1]`.
- `a` is `feat[2]`.
- `b` is `feat[-1]`.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line.
- `i` is `x + 2`.
- If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` is a list containing one element `((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.

### Code Execution:
```python
array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
```

This line appends a new element to `array2`, specifically `((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)`.

### Output State Calculation:
- `array2` now contains an additional element `((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `i`) remain unchanged.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `i` is `x + 2`, `array2` contains an additional element `((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)`**.
