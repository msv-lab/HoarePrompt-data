Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for determining whether Stepan can send all messages without running out of battery. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Logic for Turning Off and On the Phone**: The program incorrectly calculates when to turn off and on the phone. It checks if the difference between consecutive message times is less than `b / a` and then calculates the energy consumed during that period. However, it does not account for the fact that turning off and on the phone consumes `b` units of energy, regardless of the time difference.

2. **Energy Calculation**: The program sums up the energy consumed during the intervals where the phone is on and subtracts the energy consumed by turning off and on the phone. However, the logic for when to turn off and on the phone is flawed, leading to incorrect energy calculations.

3. **Initial Energy Check**: The program does not correctly check the initial energy required to send the first message. It should consider the energy consumed from time 0 to the first message time.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 10 1 2
1 3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation:**
- Initial charge: 10 units.
- Send message at time 1: 10 - 1 = 9 units remaining.
- Turn off at time 1, turn on at time 2: 9 - 2 = 7 units remaining.
- Send message at time 3: 7 - 2 = 5 units remaining.
- Turn off at time 3, turn on at time 4: 5 - 2 = 3 units remaining.
- Send message at time 5: 3 - 2 = 1 unit remaining.

The program would incorrectly calculate the energy consumption and might output "NO" for this input.

To fix the program, we need to correctly implement the logic for turning off and on the phone and accurately calculate the energy consumption at each step.
