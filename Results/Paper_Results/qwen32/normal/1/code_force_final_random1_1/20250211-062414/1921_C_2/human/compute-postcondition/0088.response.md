The code appends a calculated value to `array2`. Specifically, it calculates `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` and adds this value to `array2`. No other variables are modified.

Given the initial state, the updated state will reflect the new value added to `array2`.

Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 0, `array2` is a list containing one additional element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a`, `test_cases` retain their initial states, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`.**
