Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input where `feat[0]` (which is `n`) must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line, `i` is `n-1`. `array2` contains all elements `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` for which `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a` holds true, where `j` ranges from 1 to `n-1`. The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.**
