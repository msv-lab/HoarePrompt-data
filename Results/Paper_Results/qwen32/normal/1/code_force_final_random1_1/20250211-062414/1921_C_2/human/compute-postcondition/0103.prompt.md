Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `n` is `feat[0]`; `array2` is `[]`; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a`, `test_cases` retain their initial states; `b` is `feat[-1]`; `f` is `feat[1]`; `i` is `i + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if i == 0:
        if arr[0] < b / a:
            array2.append(arr[0] * a)
    elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 0, `array2` is either `[]` or contains one element `[arr[0] * a]` if `arr[0] < b / a`, or contains one additional element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `i != 0` and `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a`, `test_cases` retain their initial states, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, and `i` retains its value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 0, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a`, `test_cases`, and `b` retain their initial states, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, and `i` is 3. If `i` were 0 and `arr[0] < b / a`, then `array2` would contain at least one element which is `arr[0] * a`. Otherwise, if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` is either `[]` or contains elements based on the conditions given plus the new element `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`. In all other cases, `array2` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 4, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a`, `test_cases`, and `b` retain their initial states, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, and `i` is 4. If `i` were 0, `array2` would have a new element which is `arr[0] * a` appended to it if `arr[0] < b / a`; otherwise, `array2` would remain unchanged. Since `i` is 4, the else part is executed, and if `arr[4] - arr[3] < b / a`, then `array2` includes the new element `(arr[4] - arr[3]) * a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
