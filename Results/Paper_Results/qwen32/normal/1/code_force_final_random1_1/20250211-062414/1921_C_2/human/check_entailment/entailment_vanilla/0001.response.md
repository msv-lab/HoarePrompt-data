Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine whether Stepan can send all messages without running out of battery. Stepan can either keep the phone on continuously or turn it off and on between messages, with associated costs.

### Key Points:
1. **Initial Charge:** `f`
2. **Charge Loss Per Unit Time:** `a`
3. **Charge Loss On Turning Off and On:** `b`
4. **Messages Need to Be Sent At:** `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`

### Strategy:
- For each message, decide whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on.
- The decision should minimize the battery usage while ensuring that the phone doesn't run out of battery before sending a message.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It reads the list of message times `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` and adds a starting point `0` to the list.
   - For each pair of consecutive times `(ls[i-1], ls[i])`:
     - It calculates the cost of keeping the phone on for the duration `(ls[i] - ls[i-1])` which is `a * (ls[i] - ls[i-1])`.
     - It compares this cost with the cost of turning the phone off and on (`b`).
     - It subtracts the smaller of these two costs from the current battery level `f`.
   - After processing all messages, it checks if the battery level `f` is greater than `0`. If yes, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check:
The logic in the program is correct because:
- It considers both options (keeping the phone on or turning it off and on) for each interval between messages.
- It chooses the option that minimizes battery usage.
- It ensures that the battery level never goes below zero before sending a message.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
