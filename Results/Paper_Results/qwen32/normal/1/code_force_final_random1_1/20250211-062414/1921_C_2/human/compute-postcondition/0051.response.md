The code snippet `n = feat[0]` reassigns the value of `n` to the first element of the list `feat`. Since `n` was already defined as `feat[0]` in the initial state, this operation does not change the value of `n`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to the variables mentioned.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `i` is 0.**
