Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is an empty list. The current value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`.**
