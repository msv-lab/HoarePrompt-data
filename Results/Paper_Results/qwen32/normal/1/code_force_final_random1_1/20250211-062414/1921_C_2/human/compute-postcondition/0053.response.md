The code snippet `a = feat[2]` assigns the value of `feat[2]` to the variable `a`. Since `a` was already defined as `feat[2]` in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `a`. Therefore, the state of the variables remains the same except that the redundancy in the assignment is noted.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `i` is 0.**
