The given code snippet only modifies the value of `b` by assigning it the last element of the list `feat`. All other variables retain their initial states unless explicitly mentioned.

Here's the updated state:

- `feat` remains a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `n` remains `feat[0]`.
- `array2` retains its initial definition based on the conditions provided.
- `arr`, `a`, `b`, `test_cases` retain their initial states, except `b` which is now `feat[-1]`.
- `f` remains `feat[1]`.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.

Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `n` is `feat[0]`; `array2` contains elements `[arr[0] * a]` if `arr[0] < b / a` and/or `[(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a]` for each `i > 0` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`; `arr`, `a`, `test_cases` retain their initial states; `b` is `feat[-1]`; `f` is `feat[1]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
