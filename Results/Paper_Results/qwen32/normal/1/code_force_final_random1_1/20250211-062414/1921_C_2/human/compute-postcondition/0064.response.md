The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1
- `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input where `feat[0]` (which is `n`) must be greater than 1
- `f` is `feat[1]`
- `a` is `feat[2]`
- `b` is `feat[-1]`
- `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line
- `i` is 1
- `array2` is either empty or contains one element based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to proceed through the loop. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a new list of integers obtained from the input where `feat[0]` (which is `n`) must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line, `i` is 2**
