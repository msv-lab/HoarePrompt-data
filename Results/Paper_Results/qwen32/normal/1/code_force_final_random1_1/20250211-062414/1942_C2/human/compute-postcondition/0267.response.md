Postcondition: **`i` is `x`, `ans` is incremented by `gap`, and if `y < gap // 2`, `ans` is further incremented by `2 * y`. `odd` contains at least one odd gap greater than 1 and is sorted, `even` contains all even gaps greater than 0 and is sorted, `gap` is the next element in `odd`. If `y < gap // 2`, `y` is set to 0.**
