The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `tmp`. This operation does not affect the values of `tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `ans`, or `ii`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the new variable `tmp` which is an empty list.

Output State: **`tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is `x + y - 2`; `ii` is incremented by 1; `tmp` is an empty list.**
