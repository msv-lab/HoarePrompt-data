Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `x`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, and all other variables retain their original values.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
    gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
    if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
        odd.append(gap)
    elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
        even.append(gap)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` is a list containing `gap` and `even` is an empty list. Otherwise, `odd` is an empty list and `even` is a list containing `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even, otherwise `even` remains an empty list. `next_elem` is `a[x + 1]` if `x > 1` or `a[0] + n` if `x == 1`. `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `x-1`, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is incremented based on certain conditions, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[x-1] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, the `odd` list includes the new element `gap`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, the `even` list includes the new element `gap`; otherwise, the `odd` list remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 0, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is incremented based on certain conditions, `next_elem` is `a[1]` if `i < x - 1` otherwise `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[0] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, the `odd` list includes the new element `gap`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, the `even` list includes the new element `gap`. Otherwise, neither the `odd` nor the `even` list is changed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
