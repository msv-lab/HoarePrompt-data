The code snippet appends a new element to the list `tmp`. This new element is calculated as `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `tt` is greater than 0.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers with `len(a) > 1`.
- `ii` is incremented by 1.
- `tmp` is a list containing all applicable half-differences.
- `ans` is the sum of `x + y - 2` plus the increments due to differences of 2 and applicable even differences.
- The sum of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even.
- `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.

After executing the code snippet, the list `tmp` will have an additional element, which is `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`tt` is greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with `len(a) > 1`; `ii` is incremented by 1; `tmp` is a list containing all applicable half-differences including `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`; `ans` is the sum of `x + y - 2` plus the increments due to differences of 2 and applicable even differences; the sum of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.**
