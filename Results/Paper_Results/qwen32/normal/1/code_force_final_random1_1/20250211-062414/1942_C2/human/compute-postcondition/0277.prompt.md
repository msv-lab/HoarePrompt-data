Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `x`, `ans` is incremented based on the condition `(a[i] + 1) % n` not being in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` being in `st` for each iteration, `odd` contains all odd gaps greater than 1 and is sorted, and `even` contains all even gaps greater than 0 and is sorted.
Code of the loop:
for gap in odd:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `x`, `ans` is incremented by `gap`, `odd` contains at least one odd gap greater than 1 and is sorted, `even` contains all even gaps greater than 0 and is sorted, `gap` is the first element in `odd`. If `y < gap // 2`, `y` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `y` is now `y - gap // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `x`; `ans` is incremented by `2 * gap` (or `ans` is incremented by `2 * gap + 2 * y` if `y < gap // 2` initially); `odd` contains at least one odd gap greater than 1 and is sorted; `even` contains all even gaps greater than 0 and is sorted; `gap` is the next element in `odd`; `y` is `-gap // 2` if initially `y < gap // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `x`; `ans` is incremented by `2 * gap + 4 * y + gap` if `y < gap // 2` initially, otherwise `ans` is incremented by `2 * gap + 2 * y + gap`; `odd` contains at least two odd gaps greater than 1 and is sorted; `even` contains all even gaps greater than 0 and is sorted; `gap` is the next element in `odd`; `y` is `-gap // 2` if `y < gap // 2` initially, otherwise `y` is `y - gap // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
