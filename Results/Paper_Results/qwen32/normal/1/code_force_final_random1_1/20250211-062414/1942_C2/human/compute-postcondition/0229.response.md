The code snippet assigns a value to `next_elem` based on the condition `if i == x - 1`. If `i` equals `x - 1`, `next_elem` is set to `a[0] + n`; otherwise, it is set to `a[i + 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `x`
- `x` must be greater than 0
- `ans` is incremented under certain conditions (not affecting `next_elem`)
- `odd` and `even` are empty lists
- All other variables retain their original values

Since `i` is `x`, the condition `i == x - 1` evaluates to `False` unless `x` is `1`. However, the problem specifies that `x` must be greater than `0`, so we consider both cases:

1. If `x` is `1`, then `i == x - 1` is `True`, and `next_elem` is set to `a[0] + n`.
2. If `x` is greater than `1`, then `i == x - 1` is `False`, and `next_elem` is set to `a[i + 1]`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified beyond it being greater than `0`, we account for both possibilities:

- If `x` is `1`, `next_elem` becomes `a[0] + n`.
- If `x` is greater than `1`, `next_elem` becomes `a[x + 1]`.

However, since `i` is `x`, and `x` is greater than `0`, the more general case is when `x` is greater than `1`, making `next_elem` equal to `a[x + 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `next_elem` is `a[x + 1]` if `x > 1` or `a[0] + n` if `x == 1`.**
