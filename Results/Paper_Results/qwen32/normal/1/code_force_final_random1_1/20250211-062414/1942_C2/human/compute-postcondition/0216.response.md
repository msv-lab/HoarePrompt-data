Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: `i` is `i + 1`.

Code Snippet:
```python
t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
```

Impact of the code:
- `t1` is assigned the value `(a[i] + 1) % n`. This means `t1` will hold the result of the expression `(a[i] + 1) % n`.

Since the initial state only specifies that `i` is `i + 1`, we do not have specific values for `a[i]` or `n`. However, we know that `t1` is calculated based on these values.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`**.
