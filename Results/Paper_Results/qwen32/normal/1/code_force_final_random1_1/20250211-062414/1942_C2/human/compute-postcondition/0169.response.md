Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of iterations where `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st`, plus `gap` plus the current `gap`. `odd` contains at least one gap greater than 1 and odd; `even` contains all gaps greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order; `i` is `x - 1`; `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`; `gap` is the next element in `odd`; `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `st` retain their original values; `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.**

In simple terms, the value of `y` is reduced by half of the current `gap`. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
