Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` based on the specified constraints and logic, which involves analyzing gaps between the chosen vertices and adjusting the result according to the value of `y`.**
