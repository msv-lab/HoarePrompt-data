To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

Here's the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `tt` must be greater than 0
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input
- `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements
- The conditions for updating `ans`, `y`, and `tmp` based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` have been applied.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, to proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Since `i` ranges from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, the next value of `i` should be `i + 1`.

No other variables in the loop head (`a`) need to be adjusted as they are not modified within the loop head itself.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements; `i` is `i + 1`**.
