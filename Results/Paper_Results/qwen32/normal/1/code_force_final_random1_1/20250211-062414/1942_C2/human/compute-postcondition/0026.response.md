The given code snippet appends a calculated value to the list `tmp`. The calculation involves the difference between two elements of the sorted list `a` at indices `i` and `i-1`, divided by 2 (integer division). The variable `i` is updated to `i + 2` before the code snippet, meaning the current value of `i` is `i + 2` from its previous state.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `tmp` because an element is appended to it. The other variables (`tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged except for the update to `i` which is already accounted for in the description.

Output State: **`tt` must be greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is `i + 2`, `tmp` includes the new element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**
