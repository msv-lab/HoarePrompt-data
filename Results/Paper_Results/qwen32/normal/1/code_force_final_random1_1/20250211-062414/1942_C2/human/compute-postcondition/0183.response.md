Postcondition: **`ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of iterations where `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st`, plus the sum of all `gaps` in `odd`. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `ans` is further increased by `2 * y` and `y` is set to 0. Otherwise, `y` retains its original value. `odd`, `i`, `next_elem`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `st` retain their original values; `even` must have at least one element.**
