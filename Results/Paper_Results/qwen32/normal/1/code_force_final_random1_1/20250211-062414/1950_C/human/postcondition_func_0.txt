The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a string `s` of length 5 representing a time in 24-hour format. It converts this time into 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and prints the result. After processing all test cases, it terminates without returning any value.
