Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer; `s` is a non-empty string; `count` is 2 if the character at index `j` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `j + 1`, otherwise `count` remains 1; `flag` is True if the character at index `j` of `s` is '0' and the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`.**
