### Reasoning:

The given problem involves calculating the number of different final configurations of a chessboard after a certain number of moves, considering the rules for placing rooks. The program uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of configurations for different board sizes and then applies these precomputed values to solve each test case efficiently.

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid configurations for an `i x i` board.
   - The base cases are set as `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation used is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. This relation considers the ways to place rooks on the board without them attacking each other, taking into account the mirroring rule.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers `(r, c)` representing the positions of the rooks placed so far.
   - These positions are added to a set `invalid` to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied.
   - The number of remaining valid positions is calculated as `n - len(invalid)`.
   - The result for each test case is obtained from the precomputed `dp` array using `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k = 0` by initializing `dp` correctly and using `dp[n]` directly.
   - The program also handles the case where `n` is small by relying on the precomputed values.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `n = 4`, `k = 1`, Moves: `(1, 2)`
  - Invalid positions: `{1, 2}`
  - Remaining valid positions: `4 - 2 = 2`
  - Result: `dp[2] = 3`

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `n = 8`, `k = 1`, Moves: `(7, 6)`
  - Invalid positions: `{6, 7}`
  - Remaining valid positions: `8 - 2 = 6`
  - Result: `dp[6] = 331`

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `n = 1000`, `k = 4`, Moves: `(4, 4), (952, 343), (222, 333), (90, 91)`
  - Invalid positions: `{4, 952, 343, 222, 333, 90, 91}`
  - Remaining valid positions: `1000 - 7 = 993`
  - Result: `dp[993] = 671968183`

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different final configurations of the chessboard using dynamic programming. It efficiently handles the constraints and produces the expected results for the provided examples.

**Correctness: True**
