Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves determining the number of different final configurations of a chessboard after `k` moves, where `n` is the size of the chessboard. The players place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other. The computer mirrors the player's moves unless the move is on the diagonal.

### Code Analysis

1. **Initialization and Recursion Limit:**
   ```python
   import sys
   sys.setrecursionlimit(400000)
   ```
   - This sets the recursion limit to handle large inputs, which is necessary because the problem constraints allow up to \( n = 3 \times 10^5 \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Array:**
   ```python
   dp = [-1 for _ in range(300007)]
   func_1(300000)
   ```
   - A dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized to store precomputed results.
   - The function `func_1` is called to fill this array.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(n):
       dp[1] = 1
       dp[2] = 3
       for i in range(3, n + 1):
           dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
   ```
   - This function computes the number of configurations for a board of size `i`.
   - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` suggests that the number of configurations for a board of size `i` is derived from the configurations of boards of size `i-1` and `i-2`.

4. **Main Logic:**
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   for _ in range(t):
       (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
       invalid = set([])
       for _ in range(k):
           (r, c) = map(int, input().split())
           invalid.add(r)
           invalid.add(c)
       print(max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)]))
   ```
   - For each test case, the size of the board `n` and the number of moves `k` are read.
   - The `invalid` set stores the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.
   - The number of possible final configurations is determined by `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, ensuring that the result is at least 1.

### Correctness Evaluation

The main issue with the provided code is the logic used to compute the number of configurations. The recurrence relation in `func_1` does not correctly model the problem of placing non-attacking rooks on a chessboard with some positions already occupied.

The recurrence relation seems to assume a simpler problem than what is actually being solved. Specifically, the problem involves placing rooks on a board with some positions already occupied and considering the mirroring rule, which is not captured by the given recurrence relation.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
