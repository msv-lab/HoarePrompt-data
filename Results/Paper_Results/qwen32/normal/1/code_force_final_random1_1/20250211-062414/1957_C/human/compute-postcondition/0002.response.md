In the given task, the for loop iterates from 3 to `n` inclusive. The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and `n` is already defined as part of the input state. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3, because if `n` is less than 3, the range `(3, n + 1)` would be empty, and the loop would not execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range is defined by `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if the range `(3, n + 1)` is non-empty. This means `n` must be at least 3.
3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since `t`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, and `dp` values are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, `n` must be ensured to be at least 3.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5`, we need to adjust the state to ensure `n` is at least 3.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**
