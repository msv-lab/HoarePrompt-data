### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap

The problem requires calculating the number of different final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where:
- Players alternate placing rooks (white and black).
- Rooks cannot attack each other (i.e., no two rooks can be in the same row or column).
- The computer mirrors the player's move unless the move is on the diagonal.
- We need to find the number of possible final configurations modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Provided Solution Analysis

1. **Initialization and Recursion Limit:**
   ```python
   import sys
   sys.setrecursionlimit(400000)
   ```
   - This is necessary to handle large inputs, but recursion is not used in the provided code.

2. **Dynamic Programming Array:**
   ```python
   dp = [-1 for _ in range(300007)]
   func_1(300000)
   ```
   - A dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized to store precomputed results.
   - The function `func_1` fills this array.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(n):
       dp[1] = 1
       dp[2] = 3
       for i in range(3, n + 1):
           dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
   ```
   - This function computes the number of configurations for a board of size `i`.
   - Base cases: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - Recurrence relation: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.

4. **Main Logic:**
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   for _ in range(t):
       (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
       invalid = set([])
       for _ in range(k):
           (r, c) = map(int, input().split())
           invalid.add(r)
           invalid.add(c)
       print(max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)]))
   ```
   - For each test case, the size of the board `n` and the number of moves `k` are read.
   - The `invalid` set stores the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.
   - The number of possible final configurations is determined by `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, ensuring that the result is at least 1.

#### Correctness Evaluation

The provided solution uses a dynamic programming approach with a specific recurrence relation to compute the number of configurations. However, the recurrence relation does not accurately reflect the problem's constraints, particularly the mirroring rule and the fact that some positions are already occupied.

The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` appears to be derived from a simpler problem, possibly involving placing non-attacking rooks without the mirroring rule and without considering preoccupied positions.

#### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The recurrence relation and the logic used do not account for the mirroring rule and the preoccupied positions correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
