The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 3 to `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given the loop condition `for i in range(3, n + 1)`, the next value of `i` should be 5, and this value must be less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `i` is 5**
