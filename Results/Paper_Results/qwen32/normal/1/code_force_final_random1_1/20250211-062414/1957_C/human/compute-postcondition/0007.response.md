To determine the new value of `dp[i]` using the given formula, we need to substitute the known values into the equation:

Given:
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3
- `dp[3]` is 7
- `dp[4]` is 25
- `i` is 5

The formula to compute `dp[i]` is:
\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]) \% 1000000007 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ dp[5] = (dp[4] + 2 \times (5 - 1) \times dp[3]) \% 1000000007 \]
\[ dp[5] = (25 + 2 \times 4 \times 7) \% 1000000007 \]
\[ dp[5] = (25 + 8 \times 7) \% 1000000007 \]
\[ dp[5] = (25 + 56) \% 1000000007 \]
\[ dp[5] = 81 \% 1000000007 \]
\[ dp[5] = 81 \]

Thus, the value of `dp[5]` is 81.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `dp[5]` is 81, `i` is 5**
