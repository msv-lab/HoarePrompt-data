Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem described. Let's go through the key problems:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized with `-1` values, but the precomputation function `func_1` is supposed to fill this array with the number of possible configurations for a given board size.
   - However, `func_1` is called before it is defined, which would result in a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect Use of `invalid` Set**:
   - The `invalid` set is used to track rows and columns that have been occupied by rooks. However, the current implementation adds both `r` and `c` to the same set, which is incorrect because `r` and `c` represent different dimensions (rows and columns).
   - The correct approach would be to maintain separate sets for rows and columns that have been occupied.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Positions**:
   - The calculation of the number of remaining positions (`n - len(invalid)`) is incorrect because it treats rows and columns as a single pool of invalid positions.
   - Instead, the number of available rows and columns should be tracked separately.

4. **Handling of Mirror Moves**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the mirror moves. When a player places a rook at `(r, c)`, the computer places a rook at `(c, r)` unless `r == c`.
   - The program does not account for the fact that once a row or column is occupied, it cannot be used again, even if it was previously unoccupied.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `k = 0` (no initial moves) or when `n = 1` (a 1x1 board).

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

- Maintain separate sets for occupied rows and columns.
- Calculate the number of remaining rows and columns that can be used for placing rooks.
- Use dynamic programming to precompute the number of possible configurations for different board sizes.
- Correctly handle the mirror moves and ensure that no two rooks attack each other.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
