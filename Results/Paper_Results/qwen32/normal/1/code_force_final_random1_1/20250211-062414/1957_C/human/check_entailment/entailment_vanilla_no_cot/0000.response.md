Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming, but there are several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect DP Initialization and Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes the DP array `dp` with values for `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`, but the recurrence relation used is incorrect for this problem. The recurrence relation `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2])` does not correctly model the problem of placing non-attacking rooks on a chessboard with mirrored moves.

2. **Handling of Invalid Positions:**
   - The program uses a set `invalid` to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. However, it incorrectly adds both `r` and `c` to the set, which means it treats rows and columns interchangeably. This is problematic because the problem requires distinguishing between rows and columns for the mirroring rule.

3. **Final Configuration Counting:**
   - The program calculates the number of possible final configurations using `dp[n - len(invalid)]`. However, this approach does not account for the specific constraints of the problem, such as the mirroring rule and the fact that some positions may be invalid due to previous moves.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - While the program correctly applies the modulo operation `1000000007` during the DP calculation, it does not ensure that all intermediate results and final outputs are correctly handled under this modulo constraint.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, one needs to carefully consider the constraints and rules of the game, particularly the mirroring rule and the requirement to avoid attacks between rooks. A more appropriate approach might involve combinatorial mathematics or a more refined dynamic programming strategy that accurately models the problem's constraints.

Given the complexity of the problem, a correct solution would likely involve a more sophisticated algorithm than the one provided, taking into account the specific rules and constraints of the game.
