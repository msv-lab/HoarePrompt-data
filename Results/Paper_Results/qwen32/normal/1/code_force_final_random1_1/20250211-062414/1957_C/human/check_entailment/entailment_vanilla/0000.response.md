Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an `n x n` chessboard.
   - Players take turns placing rooks, ensuring no two rooks attack each other.
   - The player starts first, placing white rooks, and the computer responds by placing black rooks at mirrored positions.
   - If a move cannot be mirrored (i.e., `r = c`), the computer skips its turn.
   - After `k` moves, we need to determine how many different final configurations are possible.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The problem reduces to finding the number of ways to place rooks on the board after `k` initial moves.
   - The number of valid configurations depends on the remaining available rows and columns.
   - The problem is symmetric, and the number of configurations can be precomputed using dynamic programming.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Let `dp[i]` represent the number of ways to place rooks on an `i x i` board.
   - Base cases:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: Only one way to place a rook on a `1x1` board.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: Three ways to place rooks on a `2x2` board (one rook in each position, and one rook in each diagonal).
   - Recurrence relation:
     - For `i > 2`, the number of ways to place rooks on an `i x i` board can be derived from smaller boards:
       - Place a rook in any of the `i` positions in the first row, which eliminates one row and one column.
       - This leaves an `(i-1) x (i-1)` board.
       - Additionally, for each of the `i-1` positions in the first row, we can place a rook in the corresponding column, which leaves an `(i-2) x (i-2)` board.
       - Thus, `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2*(i-1)*dp[i-2]`.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program initializes a DP array `dp` with `-1` values and computes the values up to `300000` using the recurrence relation.
   - For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
   - It marks the rows and columns that are already occupied by the initial moves.
   - The number of remaining valid positions is `n - len(invalid)`.
   - The result is obtained from `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

5. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined but not used correctly. It should be called before processing the test cases to initialize the `dp` array.
   - The `invalid` set is used incorrectly. It should store pairs of `(r, c)` rather than individual `r` and `c` values.
   - The logic for computing the number of invalid positions is flawed. It should consider the unique rows and columns occupied by the initial moves.
   - The `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])` ensures that the result is at least 1, but this might not be correct in all scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The provided program contains several issues and does not correctly compute the number of valid configurations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
