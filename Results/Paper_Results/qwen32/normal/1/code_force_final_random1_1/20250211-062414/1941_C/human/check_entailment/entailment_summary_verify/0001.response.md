### Reasoning

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. Let's break down the issues and verify the reasoning:

1. **Counting Substrings**: The program correctly counts the number of times "map" and "pie" appear in the string `s` using `s.count('map')` and `s.count('pie')`.

2. **Summing Counts**: The program sums these counts and prints the result. However, this approach fails to account for overlapping substrings.

3. **Overlapping Substrings**: Consider the string "mapie":
   - "map" appears once.
   - "pie" appears once.
   - Summing these counts gives 2, but only 2 deletions are needed to remove both substrings (e.g., removing "ma" or "ie").

4. **Minimum Deletions**: To find the minimum number of deletions required, we need to consider the optimal way to remove characters such that all occurrences of "map" and "pie" are eliminated. This involves more complex logic than simply counting non-overlapping occurrences.

5. **Dynamic Programming or Greedy Approach**: A correct solution would typically involve a dynamic programming approach or a greedy algorithm to ensure that deletions are minimized and overlapping substrings are handled properly.

Given these points, the program's logic is flawed because it does not handle overlapping substrings correctly and thus overcounts the necessary deletions.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate in stating that the provided program is incorrect. The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful due to its failure to account for overlapping substrings.

### Final Answer

Final: **False**
