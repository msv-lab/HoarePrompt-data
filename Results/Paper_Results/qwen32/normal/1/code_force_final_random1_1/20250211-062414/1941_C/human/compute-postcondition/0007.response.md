The code snippet provided is `a = int(input())`. This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. None of the other variables (`t`, `s`, `x`, `y`) are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `a` is an input integer (which will be overwritten)
- `s` is the string input from the user
- `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`
- `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`

After executing the code snippet, the variable `a` will be updated to the new integer input value provided by the user. All other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is the new input integer; `s` is the string input from the user; `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`; `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.**
