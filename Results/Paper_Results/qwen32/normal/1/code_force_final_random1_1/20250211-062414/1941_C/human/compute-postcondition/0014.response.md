The code snippet `s = input()` updates the value of `s` to whatever string the user inputs. The values of `t`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is the new input integer; `s` is the string input from the user; `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`; `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**
