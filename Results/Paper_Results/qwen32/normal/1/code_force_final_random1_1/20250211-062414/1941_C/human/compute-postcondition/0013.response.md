The code snippet `a = int(input())` updates the value of `a` by reading a new integer input from the user. The values of `t`, `s`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `a` is the new input integer; `s` is the new string input from the user; `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`; `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**
