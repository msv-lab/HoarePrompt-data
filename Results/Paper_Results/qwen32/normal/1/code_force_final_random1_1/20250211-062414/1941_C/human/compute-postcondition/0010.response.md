The code updates the value of `y` to be the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is the new input integer; `s` is the new string input from the user; `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`; `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**
