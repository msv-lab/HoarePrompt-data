The code snippet updates the value of `y` to be the count of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`. The values of `t`, `a`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is the new input integer; `s` is the string input from the user; `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`; `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**
