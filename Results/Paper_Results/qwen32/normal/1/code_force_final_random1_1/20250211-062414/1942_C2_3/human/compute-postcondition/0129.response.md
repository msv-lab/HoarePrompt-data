Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer value based on the given conditions and constraints. The result represents a computed value considering the distribution of the chosen vertices and the parameter `y`.**
