The code snippet appends the result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given that `a` is a sorted list of integers and `i` is `i + 2`, the value being appended is half the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `a`, rounded down to the nearest integer.

Output State: **`tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with `len(a) > 1`; `i` is `i + 2`; `tmp` now includes an additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**
