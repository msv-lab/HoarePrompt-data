Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `ii` is incremented by 2; `tmp` is an empty list; `ans` is `x + y - 2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input with at least 2 elements; `ii` is incremented by 2; `tmp` is either an empty list or contains `[(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2]` if the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is true and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2; `ans` is `x + y - 1` if `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 2` if the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is false, or `x + y - 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if the condition is true; if the condition is true, `y` is adjusted to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)` and `tmp` is updated accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input with at least 2 elements; `ii` is incremented by 2; `i` is incremented by 1; `tmp` is either an empty list or contains `[(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2]` if the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is true and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2; `ans` is updated to `x + y` if `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ans` is updated to `x + y - 1` if the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is false, or `ans` is updated to `x + y - 1 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if the condition is true; `y` is adjusted to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)` if the condition is true, otherwise `y` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input with at least 2 elements; `ii` is incremented by 2; `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, `tmp` contains an additional element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. No changes are made to `y`, `tmp`, or `ans` in all other cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
