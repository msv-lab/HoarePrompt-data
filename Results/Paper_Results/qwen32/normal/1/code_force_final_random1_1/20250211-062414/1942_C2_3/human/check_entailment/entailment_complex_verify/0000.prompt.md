You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #State: The output state is a series of integers, each representing the result of a test case, calculated as described above and printed on a new line for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer value based on the given conditions and constraints. The result represents a computed value considering the distribution of the chosen vertices and the parameter `y`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
Upon reviewing the provided program, there are several issues that suggest it may not always produce the correct result according to the problem description.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the vertices wrap around the polygon. Specifically, the check `if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2` is incorrect because it should be checking if the gap between the last and first vertex is exactly 2, but the calculation `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1])` is incorrect. It should be `(a[0] + n - a[-1]) % n`.
   
2. **Incorrect Calculation of Additional Vertices:**
   - The logic for calculating additional vertices (`y`) is flawed. The condition `elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:` is incorrect. It should consider the actual number of vertices that can be added without exceeding `y`. Also, the decrement of `y` is incorrect; it should be `y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.

3. **Logic for Adding Remaining Vertices:**
   - The final addition `ans += y` is incorrect. It assumes that all remaining `y` vertices can be used to form additional triangles, which is not necessarily true.

4. **Final Output Constraint:**
   - The final output is constrained by `min(ans, n - 2)`, which is correct, but the preceding calculations might still lead to incorrect results.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
8 4 2
1 3 5 7
```
- Here, the vertices are evenly spaced, and we can form 6 triangles by adding 2 vertices optimally.
- However, the program might incorrectly calculate the number of triangles due to the flawed logic mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
