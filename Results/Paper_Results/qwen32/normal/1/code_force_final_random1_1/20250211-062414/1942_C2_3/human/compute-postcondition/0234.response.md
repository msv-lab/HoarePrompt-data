Postcondition: **`i` is `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `next_elem` is `a[x + 1]` if `x > 1` or `a[0] + n` if `x == 1`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, and `gap` is greater than 0 and even.**
