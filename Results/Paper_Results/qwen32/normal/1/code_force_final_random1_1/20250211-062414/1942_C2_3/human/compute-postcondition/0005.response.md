Output State: **`tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is `x + y - 2`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is calculated as `x + y - 2`. The values of `tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
