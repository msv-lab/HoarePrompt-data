Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 1, `x` is the number of iterations, `n` and `y` are the values returned by `R()`, `l` is the sorted list returned by `R()` with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended, `val` is a sorted list of `x` elements where each element is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `x` (sorted first by evenness and then by value), `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was equal to 1, and `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `x` is at least 1, `n` and `y` are the values returned by `R()` with `y` updated to `y - c`, `l` is a sorted list returned by `R()` with at least two elements (including the additional element `n + l[0]` appended), `val` is a non-empty sorted list of `x` elements where each element is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `x` (sorted first by evenness and then by value), and `sx` and `cons` are calculated based on the conditions involving `y` and `c` as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 1, `x` is at least 1, `n` and `y` are the values returned by `R()`, `y` is updated to `y - 2*c`, `l` is a sorted list returned by `R()` with at least two elements, including the additional element `n + l[0]`, `val` is a non-empty sorted list of `x` elements where each element is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `x`, sorted first by evenness and then by value, `cons` are calculated based on the conditions involving `y` and `c`, `i` is the next element in `val` after its current value, `c` is `i // 2`. If `y < c`, `sx` is updated to its original value plus `y * 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `sx` is updated to `sx + i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 1, `x` is at least 1, `n` and `y` are the values returned by `R()` (with `y` now being `y - c`), `y` is updated to `y - 2*c` (before the current decrement), `l` is a sorted list returned by `R()` with at least two elements, including the additional element `n + l[0]`, `val` is a non-empty sorted list of `x` elements where each element is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `x`, sorted first by evenness and then by value, `cons` are calculated based on the conditions involving `y` and `c`, `i` is the next element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
