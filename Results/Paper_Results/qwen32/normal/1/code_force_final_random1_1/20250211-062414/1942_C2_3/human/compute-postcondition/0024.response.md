To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and the implicit length of the list `a`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `tt` must be greater than 0.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- The logic inside the loop modifies `ans`, `y`, and `tmp` based on the difference between consecutive elements in `a`.

Since the loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to `len(a) - 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

- `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, so for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented again by 1.
- The other variables (`tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `ans`, `tmp`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`tt` must be greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is `i + 2`**.
