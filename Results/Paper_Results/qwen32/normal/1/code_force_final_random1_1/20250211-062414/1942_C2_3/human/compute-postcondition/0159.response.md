Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, where `n` is the total number of vertices, `x` is the number of chosen vertices, and `y` is an additional parameter. It also accepts a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given parameters.**
