#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

    #State: The output state is a series of integers, each representing the result of a test case, calculated as described above and printed on a new line for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer value based on the given conditions and constraints. The result represents a computed value considering the distribution of the chosen vertices and the parameter `y`.
