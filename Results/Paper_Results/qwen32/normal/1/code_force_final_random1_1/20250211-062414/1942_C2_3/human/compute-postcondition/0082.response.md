Postcondition: **tt must be greater than 0; n, x, and y are integers obtained from the input; a is a sorted list of integers with len(a) > 1; ii is incremented by 1; tmp is a list containing all applicable half-differences. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, then ans is the sum of x + y - 2 plus the increments due to differences of 2 and applicable even differences plus 1. Otherwise, if the sum of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)` and `tmp` includes `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, and ans is the sum of x + y - 2 plus the increments due to differences of 2 and applicable even differences plus `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged and `tmp` does not include `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.**
