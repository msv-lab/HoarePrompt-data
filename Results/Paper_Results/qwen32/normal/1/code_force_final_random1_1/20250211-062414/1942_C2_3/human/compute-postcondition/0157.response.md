To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information:

- `t` is mentioned as "unchanged," but it is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `cons` is defined as `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`. This means `cons` will take the smaller value between `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`.

Since the specific values of `n`, `x`, and `sx` are not provided, we cannot compute a numerical value for `cons`. However, we can describe the expression precisely based on the given formula.

Therefore, the output of the `print(cons)` statement will be the result of the `min` function applied to `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`.

Output: **cons (where cons is the minimum value between n - 2 and x + sx - 2)**
