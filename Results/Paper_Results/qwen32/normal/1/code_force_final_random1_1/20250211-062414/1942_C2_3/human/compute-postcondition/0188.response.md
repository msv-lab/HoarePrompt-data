Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of iterations where `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st`, plus the sum of all `gaps` in `odd`, plus `gap`, plus `2 * y`; `odd`, `i`, `next_elem`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `st`, `even` retain their original values; `y` is 0; `gap` is the next element in `even`.**

Natural Language: The value of `y` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their original values as specified in the initial state.
