Postcondition: **`ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of iterations where `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st`, plus the sum of all `gaps` in `odd`. `y` is reduced by half of each `gap` processed and currently `y` is less than the current `gap // 2`. `odd`, `i`, `next_elem`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `st` retain their original values; `even` must have at least one element.**
