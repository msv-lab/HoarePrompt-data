To determine the final state of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables over time. The loop continues until `n` becomes 0. In each iteration, it calculates `m` as `(n + 1) // 2`, subtracts `m` from `n`, and appends `m` to the list `L`.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: Input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\)
   - `n`: Input integer
   - `k`: Input integer
   - `L`: Empty list `[]`
   - `tot`: 1
   - `pow`: 2

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - In each iteration, `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - `n` is updated to `n - m`.
   - `m` is appended to the list `L`.

The loop terminates when `n` becomes 0. At this point, `L` will contain the sequence of `m` values calculated during each iteration.

### Final Output State

- `t`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- `n`: Becomes 0 after the loop terminates.
- `k`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- `L`: Contains the sequence of values `[m1, m2, ..., mk]` where each `mi` is `(ni + 1) // 2` and `ni` is the value of `n` at the start of the i-th iteration.
- `tot`: Remains 1 as it is not modified in the loop.
- `pow`: Remains 2 as it is not modified in the loop.

### Example Calculation

Let's consider an example with `n = 7`:

1. **First Iteration**:
   - `m = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4`
   - `n = 7 - 4 = 3`
   - `L = [4]`

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `m = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2`
   - `n = 3 - 2 = 1`
   - `L = [4, 2]`

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `m = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`
   - `n = 1 - 1 = 0`
   - `L = [4, 2, 1]`

The loop terminates when `n` becomes 0. The final list `L` is `[4, 2, 1]`.

### Conclusion

The final output state of the loop is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is the list of values `[m1, m2, ..., mk]` where each `mi` is `(ni + 1) // 2` and `ni` is the value of `n` at the start of the i-th iteration, `tot` is 1, `pow` is 2.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `n` will be 0, and `L` will contain the sequence of values calculated in each iteration of the loop. All other variables (`t`, `k`, `tot`, `pow`) remain unchanged.
