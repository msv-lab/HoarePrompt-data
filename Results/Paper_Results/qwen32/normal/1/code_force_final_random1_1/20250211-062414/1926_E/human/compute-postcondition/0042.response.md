The code appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. The value of `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is [`(n + 1) // 2`], `tot` is 1, `pow` is 2, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
