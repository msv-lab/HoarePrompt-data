Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is [1], `pow` is 2. If `tot` (before increment) is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` (before increment) + `a`, then `tot` (after increment) is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, the conditions on `tot` and `k` remain unspecified. The loop cannot execute another iteration as there are no more elements in `L`.**
