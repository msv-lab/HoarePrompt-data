Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than half of `n`, it performs a series of calculations involving halving and summing values to determine the result. Otherwise, it directly computes the result as `2 * k - 1`.**
