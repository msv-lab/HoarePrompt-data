Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is the list of values `[m1, m2, ..., mk]` where each `mi` is `(ni + 1) // 2` and `ni` is the value of `n` at the start of the i-th iteration, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
    tot += a
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is at least 1, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 2, `tot` is `tot + a`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then `tot` remains unchanged and `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of `tot` and `k` is not specified by the given information.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is at least 1, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 4, `a` is the next element in the list `L`, and `tot` is updated to its previous value plus `a` again.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is at least 1, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 8, `a` is the next element in the list `L` (denoted as `a_next`), and `tot` is updated to its previous value plus `a`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a_next`, the condition holds true; otherwise, no further action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
