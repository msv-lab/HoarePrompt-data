The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `tot`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is the list of values `[m1, m2, ..., mk]` where each `mi` is `(ni + 1) // 2` and `ni` is the value of `n` at the start of the i-th iteration, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 2.**
