Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is at least 1, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 1. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then `tot` remains unchanged and `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of `tot` and `k` is not specified by the given information.**
