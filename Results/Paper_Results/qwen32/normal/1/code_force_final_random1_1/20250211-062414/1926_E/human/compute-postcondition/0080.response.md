The value of `n` is decremented by `m`. Given that `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` will be `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`; `k` is `input_k`; `L` is `[(n + 1) // 2]`; `tot` is `0`; `pow` is `1`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
