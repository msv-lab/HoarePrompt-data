Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; if `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), then `s` is the accumulated sum of `(d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k` or `d` becomes 0, `i` is the number of iterations performed, `d` is the remaining value of `d` after the last iteration, `h` is 0, `p` is `P_final`, `g` is `G_final`, `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is 2. Otherwise, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is 2.**
