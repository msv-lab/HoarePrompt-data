Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n` is set to 1.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `L` is initialized as a list containing a single element, `[1]`.
- `pow` is set to 4.
- `tot` is described as `tot` (before increment) + `a`. However, there is no mention of `a` being defined anywhere in the initial state. Given the context, it seems like `tot` is intended to be incremented by `a` but since `a` is not provided, we'll assume `tot` remains 0 if no previous operations have set it.
- The loop cannot execute another iteration as there are no more elements in `L`.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

### Variable Values:
- `pow` is explicitly given as 4.
- `k` is an input integer, so we'll denote its value as `k`.
- `tot` is assumed to be 0 unless otherwise specified. Since there's no information about `a` or any previous increments to `tot`, we'll take `tot` as 0.

### Substituting the Values:
- `pow` = 4
- `k` = `k` (input integer)
- `tot` = 0

The expression inside the `print` function becomes:
\[ \text{pow} \times (2 \times (\text{k} - \text{tot}) - 1) \]
Substituting the values:
\[ 4 \times (2 \times (k - 0) - 1) \]
\[ 4 \times (2 \times k - 1) \]
\[ 4 \times (2k - 1) \]

### Final Expression:
The final expression to be printed is:
\[ 4 \times (2k - 1) \]

### Output:
The output will be the result of the expression `4 * (2 * k - 1)` where `k` is the input integer.

Output: **4 * (2 * k - 1) (where k is the input integer)**
