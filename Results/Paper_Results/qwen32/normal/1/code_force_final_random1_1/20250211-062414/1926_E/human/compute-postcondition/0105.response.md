To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the states after the first three iterations.

### Analysis:
- The variable `L` is populated with the sequence of values obtained from `(n + 1) // 2` in each iteration until `n` becomes 0.
- Since `n` starts at 0 and remains 0 throughout the loop, the value added to `L` in each iteration will always be `(0 + 1) // 2 = 1`. Therefore, `L` will be a list of 1s, and its length will be equal to the number of iterations the loop runs.
- The loop runs as long as there are elements in `L` to iterate over. Given the initial state, `L` will be `[1]` after the first iteration, `[1, 1]` after the second, and so on. This means the loop will run `t` times because `t` determines the number of elements in `L`.
- The variable `tot` accumulates the sum of the elements in `L`. After `t` iterations, `tot` will be the sum of `t` ones, which is `t`.
- The variable `pow` doubles in each iteration. After `t` iterations, `pow` will be `2^t`.
- The condition `if tot < k and k <= tot + a` checks if `k` falls within the range defined by the current accumulated total `tot` and the next element `a` in `L`. If it does, the code prints `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains the same as the input integer.
- `n` remains `0`.
- `k` remains `input_k`.
- `L` will be a list of `t` ones, i.e., `[1] * t`.
- `tot` will be `t` after `t` iterations.
- `pow` will be `2^t` after `t` iterations.

Since the problem statement asks for the output state after all executions of the loop have finished, and no specific print statements or other outputs are mentioned beyond the conditions inside the loop, we focus on the final values of the variables.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is `0`; `k` is `input_k`; `L` is `[1] * t`; `tot` is `t`; `pow` is `2^t`.**

In natural language, after all iterations, the variable `t` remains the same as the input integer, `n` stays `0`, `k` remains as the input `k`, `L` contains `t` ones, `tot` equals `t`, and `pow` equals `2` raised to the power of `t`.
