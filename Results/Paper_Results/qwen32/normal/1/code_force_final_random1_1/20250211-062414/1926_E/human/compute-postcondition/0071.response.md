The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common placeholder for a loop variable when its value is not used). However, since `_` does not influence the loop's continuation condition directly, we focus on the loop's continuation condition, which is determined by the variable `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\). The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, no adjustments are needed for `_`. Instead, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Given that `t` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be `t - 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is the list of values `[m1, m2, ..., mk]` where each `mi` is `(ni + 1) // 2`, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, `pow` is \(2^{\text{length of } L}\)**

Note: The values of `n`, `k`, `L`, `tot`, and `pow` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values are not influenced by the loop variable `_`.
