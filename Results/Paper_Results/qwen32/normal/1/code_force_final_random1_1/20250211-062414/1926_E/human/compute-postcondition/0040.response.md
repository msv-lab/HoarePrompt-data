The code snippet calculates the value of `m` as `(n + 1) // 2`. This means `m` is assigned the integer division result of `n + 1` by `2`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` is a non-zero integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `L` is an empty list []
- `tot` is 1
- `pow` is 2

After executing the code snippet, the only variable that changes is `m`, which is now equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is an input integer, `L` is [], `tot` is 1, `pow` is 2, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.
