The code snippet `n -= m` subtracts the value of `m` from `n`. Given that `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` will be `n - (n + 1) // 2`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `k`, `L`, `tot`, `pow`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is [], `tot` is 1, `pow` is 2, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
