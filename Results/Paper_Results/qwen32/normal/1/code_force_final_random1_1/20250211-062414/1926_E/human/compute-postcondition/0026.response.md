Let's break down the initial state and the given Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\). This variable does not directly affect the print statement.
- `n`: Set to 1.
- `k`: An input integer.
- `L`: A list initialized with a single element `[1]`.
- `pow`: Set to 2.
- `tot`: Initially not explicitly defined but described as `tot` + `a`. Since there's only one element in `L`, `a` must be the first (and only) element of `L`, which is 1. Therefore, `tot` is initially 0, and after adding `a` (which is 1), `tot` becomes 1.

### Conditions and Loop Execution:
- The loop cannot execute another iteration because there are no more elements in `L` after processing the first element.
- The condition specified is: If `tot` (before increment) is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` (before increment) + `a`, then `tot` (after increment) is greater than or equal to `k`. Given `tot` is 0 and `a` is 1, this translates to: If `0 < k <= 1`, then `tot` becomes 1 after the increment. However, since `k` is an input integer and not constrained to be within this range, we need to consider the general case where `tot` is 1 after the single iteration.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

Substituting the known values:
- `pow` = 2
- `tot` = 1 (after the single iteration)

The expression inside the print statement becomes:
\[ \text{print}(2 * (2 * (k - 1) - 1)) \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ 2 * (2 * (k - 1) - 1) = 2 * (2k - 2 - 1) = 2 * (2k - 3) = 4k - 6 \]

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the value of the expression `4k - 6`.

Output: **4k - 6**
