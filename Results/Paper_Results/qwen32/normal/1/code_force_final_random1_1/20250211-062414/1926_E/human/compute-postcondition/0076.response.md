The code snippet `n -= m` reduces the value of `n` by the value of `m`. Given that `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` will be `n - (n + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is reduced by `(n + 1) // 2`; `k` is `input_k`; `L` is `[]`; `tot` is `0`; `pow` is `1`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
