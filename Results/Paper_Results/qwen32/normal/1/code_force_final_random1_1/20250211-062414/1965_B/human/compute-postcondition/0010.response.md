The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b` (which must be greater than 2), and `ans` is `[2, 3, 2]`.

Since the loop starts from `i = 2`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, `i` should be 2. The value of `l` does not change as it is determined by the length of the binary representation of `n`.

State: **`k` equals 1, `n` is at least 4, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b` (which must be greater than 2), `ans` is `[2, 3, 2], `i` is 2**
