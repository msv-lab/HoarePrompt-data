To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `lk`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(lk - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state was:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `3 ≤ k ≤ n`
- `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix
- `l` is the length of `b`
- `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix
- `lk` is the length of `bk` and `lk` must be at least 2
- `ans` is `[1]`
- `i` is 0

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

The variable `lk` does not change during the loop iterations as it is the length of the binary representation of `k`, which remains constant.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `3 ≤ k ≤ n`; `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of `b`; `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `lk` is the length of `bk` and `lk` must be at least 2; `ans` is `[1]`; `i` is 1**
