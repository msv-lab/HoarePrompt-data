The function `func_12` calculates a rank for a given key `da` in the dictionary `d` by recursively evaluating its connected nodes in `d` using the `processing` list to track visited nodes. It updates the `rank` list with the calculated rank for `da`. If the list associated with `da` contains only one element, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the minimum rank obtained from its connected nodes plus one.
