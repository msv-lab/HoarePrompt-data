To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step-by-step against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to generate a sequence `a` of non-negative integers such that:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `v`.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_11`) and two main functions (`func_12` and `func_13`), but only `func_14` and `func_15` are relevant for solving the problem. Here’s how they work:

- **`func_14()`**: This function generates the sequence `a` for a given pair `(n, k)`. It handles two cases:
  - When `k == 1`: It constructs a sequence that avoids sums equal to 1 but allows all other sums up to `n`.
  - When `k > 1`: It constructs a sequence that avoids sums equal to `k` but allows all other sums up to `n`.

- **`func_15()`**: This function reads the number of test cases and applies `func_14()` to each test case, printing the results.

### Detailed Examination of `func_14()`

#### Case 1: `k == 1`
- The sequence starts with `[2, 3]` and continues with powers of 2 (`2^i` for `i >= 2`).
- This ensures that no subsequence can sum to 1 because the smallest element is 2.
- All sums from 2 to `n` can be formed using combinations of these elements.

#### Case 2: `k > 1`
- The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k-1`.
- It then adds `k-1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the initial part is less than `k`.
- It includes `k+1` and `2*k+1` to avoid forming `k` while still allowing sums close to `k`.
- It continues with powers of 2 beyond the length of the binary representation of `k`.

### Verification Against Edge Cases
Let's verify if the program handles various edge cases correctly:

1. **Small Values of `n` and `k`**:
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the sequence `[1]` is correct because it allows sums of 1 but not 2.
   - For `n = 6` and `k = 1`, the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` is correct because it allows sums from 2 to 6 but not 1.
   - For `n = 8` and `k = 8`, the sequence `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` is correct because it allows sums from 1 to 7 but not 8.
   - For `n = 9` and `k = 3`, the sequence `[7, 1, 4, 1]` is correct because it allows sums from 1 to 9 except 3.
   - For `n = 10` and `k = 7`, the sequence `[1, 2, 8, 3]` is correct because it allows sums from 1 to 10 except 7.

2. **Larger Values of `n` and `k`**:
   - The logic for generating the sequence should handle larger values of `n` and `k` correctly by ensuring that the sum of any subset of the sequence does not equal `k` while allowing all other sums up to `n`.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the program, it appears to correctly handle the problem requirements for all provided examples and edge cases. The logic for constructing the sequence ensures that the conditions are met for both small and large values of `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly constructs sequences that meet the problem requirements for all test cases and edge scenarios, ensuring that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums up to `n`.
