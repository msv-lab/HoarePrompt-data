To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's systematically analyze the sequence construction logic in `func_14()` against the problem requirements.

### Problem Recap
We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. It then constructs a sequence `a` for each test case according to the rules specified in the problem statement.

#### Key Functions
- `func_7()`: Reads a line of input and returns a list of integers.
- `func_10()`: Reads a single integer from input.
- `func_14()`: Constructs the sequence `a` for a given `n` and `k`.
- `func_15()`: Handles multiple test cases by calling `func_14()` for each one.

#### Sequence Construction Logic (`func_14()`)
1. **Binary Representation**: The function converts `n` and `k` into their binary representations.
2. **Case when `k == 1`**:
   - If `n == 2`, it returns `[2]`.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `ans` with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 until the length of the binary representation of `n` is reached.
3. **General Case (`k != 1`)**:
   - Initializes `ans` with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus one.
   - Appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to `ans` to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - Appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to `ans`.
   - Appends additional powers of 2 to cover the remaining bits of `n`.

### Verification
To verify the correctness of the program, we need to check if the constructed sequence satisfies both conditions for every possible `n` and `k` within the given constraints.

1. **No Subsequence Sums to `k`**:
   - **Case `k == 1`**: The sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ...]` does not include `1` and cannot sum to `1` because the smallest element is `2`.
   - **General Case (`k != 1`)**:
     - The term `k - 1 - sum(ans)` ensures that the exact sum `k` cannot be formed. This is because the sum of the powers of 2 up to `2^{lk-2}` is less than `k - 1`, and adding `k - 1 - sum(ans)` prevents the sum `k` from being achievable.
     - The terms `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` are also added to ensure that the sequence can still form other sums while avoiding `k`.

2. **Subsequences Sum to All Values Except `k`**:
   - **Case `k == 1`**: The sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ...]` can form all sums from `2` to `n` using combinations of powers of 2.
   - **General Case (`k != 1`)**:
     - The inclusion of powers of 2 ensures that all sums from `1` to `n` can be formed, except for `k`.
     - The term `k - 1 - sum(ans)` is carefully chosen to avoid forming the sum `k`.
     - The terms `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` help in forming sums that are close to `k` without actually forming `k`.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations
Let's review the annotations to ensure the logic holds:

- **Case `k == 1`**:
  - When `n == 2`, the sequence `[2]` correctly avoids `k` and forms all sums from `2` to `n`.
  - For other values of `n`, the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ...]` avoids `1` and forms all sums from `2` to `n`.

- **General Case (`k != 1`)**:
  - The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to `2^{lk-2}`, ensuring coverage of sums up to `k - 1`.
  - The term `k - 1 - sum(ans)` ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed.
  - The terms `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` help in forming sums around `k` without including `k`.
  - Additional powers of 2 ensure coverage of sums up to `n`.

### Conclusion
Based on the detailed analysis and verification using the annotations, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the special case when `k == 1` separately and uses a combination of powers of 2 and carefully chosen additional values to meet the requirements for general cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: True**
