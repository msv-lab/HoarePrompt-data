You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

    #The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, each of which is a tuple (25, sequence). The `sequence` is a predefined list of 25 powers of 2 starting from 2^0 up to 2^24.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer `t` and a list of `t` tuples `cases` as input. It returns a list of `t` elements, where each element is a tuple consisting of the integer `25` and a predefined list of 25 powers of 2 starting from `2^0` up to `2^24`. The values of `n` and `k` in each tuple of `cases` do not affect the output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program and determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should satisfy two conditions:
     1. There should be no subsequence of `a` whose sum equals `k`.
     2. For every integer `v` (where `1 <= v <= n` and `v != k`), there should be a subsequence of `a` whose sum equals `v`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads each pair of integers `(n, k)` for each test case.
   - It defines a function `func_1` which generates a sequence for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, it initializes a sequence `sequence` consisting of powers of 2 up to `2^24` (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^24]`).
   - For each test case `(n, k)`, it appends the sequence of size 25 to the results list without any modification.

3. **Evaluating the Sequence:**
   - The sequence `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^24]` can indeed generate any sum from `1` to `2^25 - 1` using different combinations of its elements. This is because these numbers form a basis for binary representation.
   - However, the sequence does not consider the condition that there should be no subsequence whose sum equals `k`. Since `k` can be any value between `1` and `n`, and the sequence includes all powers of 2, it will always include a combination that sums to `k` unless `k` is specifically excluded.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided sequence does not guarantee that there will be no subsequence whose sum equals `k`. Therefore, the solution does not meet the problem's requirements.
