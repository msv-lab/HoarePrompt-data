Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: This function does not have any parameters in its signature, so there are no variables to describe. However, it implies that it relies on other functions (`func_10` and `func_14`) which are not provided here. Based on the context, `func_10` likely returns the number of test cases, and `func_14` computes and returns the result for each test case.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(func_10()):
    sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The value returned by `func_14()` is written to the standard output as a string followed by a newline. `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The value returned by `func_14()` is written to the standard output as a string followed by a newline. `func_10()` returns 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The value returned by `func_14()` is written to the standard output as a string followed by a newline. `func_10()` returns 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
