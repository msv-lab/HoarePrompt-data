The code assigns the value of `i` to `k`. Given that `i` is the previous value of `n`, and `k` was initially 1, `k` now holds the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the previous value of `n`, `i` is the previous value of `n`, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `previous n-1`) for which the response was '<', `res` is the user input, and `res` equals '<'.**
