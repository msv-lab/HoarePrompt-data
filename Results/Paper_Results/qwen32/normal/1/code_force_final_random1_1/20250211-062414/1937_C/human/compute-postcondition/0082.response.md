To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: Remains the same (value unknown from the given information).
2. **n**: Must be greater than 2 (exact value unknown but > 2).
3. **k**: Is set to 1.
4. **i**: Is the previous value of `n` (so if `n` is currently 5, `i` would be 4).
5. **best**: Is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `previous n-1`) for which the response was '<'. This value is not directly used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down the values being printed:
- `'?'`: A literal string.
- `0`: A literal integer.
- `k`: As per the initial state, `k` is 1.
- `0`: Another literal integer.
- `i`: The previous value of `n`. Since `n` is greater than 2, `i` will be `n-1`.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the output will be:
- `'?'`
- `0`
- `1` (the value of `k`)
- `0`
- `i` (which is `n-1`)

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only express `i` as `n-1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 1 0 n-1 (where n is greater than 2)**
