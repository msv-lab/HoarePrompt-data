To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement includes several elements: `'?'`, `0`, `k`, `0`, and `i`.
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `0` is a literal integer.
- `k` and `i` are variables whose values are not explicitly stated in the initial state.

Since the initial state does not provide explicit values for `k` and `i`, we can only describe their values based on the information given. Therefore, we will include them in the output description as they are.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output a sequence of values separated by spaces. The first value is the literal string `'?'`, followed by the literal integer `0`, then the value of the variable `k`, another literal integer `0`, and finally the value of the variable `i`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 [k] 0 [i] (where k and i are variables with unspecified values)**
