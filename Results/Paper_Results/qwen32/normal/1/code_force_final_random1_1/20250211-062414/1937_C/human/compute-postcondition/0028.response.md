Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
2. `n` is greater than 1.
3. `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'` or 1 if no such index exists.
4. `i` is `n-1`.
5. `res` is the input value.
6. If `res` is `'<'`, then `best` is `n`. Otherwise, `best` remains 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement outputs a series of values separated by spaces.
- The values to be printed are: `'?'`, `k`, `best`, `k`, and `i`.

#### Values:
- `'?'`: This is a literal string.
- `k`: This is the largest index `i` from 2 to `n-1` for which the response was `'<'`. If no such index exists, `k` is 1.
- `best`: This depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is `'<'`, `best` is `n`; otherwise, `best` is 0.
- `k`: This is repeated from the previous point.
- `i`: This is always `n-1`.

### Output Description:
Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be:
- `'?'`: A literal string.
- `k`: The largest index `i` from 2 to `n-1` for which the response was `'<'`, or 1 if no such index exists.
- `best`: `n` if `res` is `'<'`; otherwise, 0.
- `k`: Repeated from the previous point.
- `i`: Always `n-1`.

Thus, the output will be formatted as:
Output: **? [k] [best] [k] [n-1] (where k is the largest index i from 2 to n-1 for which the response was '<', or 1 if no such index exists, best is n if res is '<'; otherwise, 0, and n-1 is the value of i)**

However, since we need to provide the most precise description possible, we can simplify it to:

Output: **? [k] [best] [k] [n-1]**
