Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `i` is 1, `best` is 1, `res` is the user input, and `res` equals `'<'`.**

Explanation: The value of `best` has been updated to the current value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
