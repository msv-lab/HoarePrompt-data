In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the function `int(input())`. Since the loop head only involves these elements, we need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is a valid integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10³).

Here's how we can adjust the state:

1. **Input Value**: The input to `int(input())` should be an integer `t` that satisfies the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. This ensures that the loop will execute `t` times.

2. **Loop Variable**: The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Its initial value doesn't matter because it gets reassigned during each iteration of the loop.

Given these considerations, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the input value is within the required range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³**
