Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` remains the same (its value is not specified, but it is irrelevant for this print statement).
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `k` is set to the previous value of `n` if `res` equals `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1.
- `i` is set to the previous value of `n` + 1.
- `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `previous n-1`) for which the response was `<`.
- `res` is the user input.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement outputs a series of values separated by spaces.
- The first value is always `'?'`.
- The second value is always `0`.
- The third value is `k`, which depends on the value of `res`:
  - If `res` is `'<'`, then `k` is the previous value of `n`.
  - Otherwise, `k` is `1`.
- The fourth value is always `0`.
- The fifth value is `i`, which is the previous value of `n` + 1.

### Output Description:
- The first value is `'?'`.
- The second value is `0`.
- The third value is `k` (which is either the previous value of `n` if `res` is `'<'`, or `1` otherwise).
- The fourth value is `0`.
- The fifth value is `i` (which is the previous value of `n` + 1).

### Final Output:
Given the conditions and the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 k 0 i (where k is the previous value of n if res is '<', otherwise k is 1, and i is the previous value of n + 1)**
