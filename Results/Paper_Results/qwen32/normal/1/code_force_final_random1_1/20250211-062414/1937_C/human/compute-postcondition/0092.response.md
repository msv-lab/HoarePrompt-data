To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(2, n):`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is determined based on the value of `res`, `i` is the previous value of `n` + 1, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `previous n-1`) for which the response was '<', and `res` is the user input.

Since the loop variable `i` is incremented automatically by the `range` function, we need to set `i` to the next value it would take in the sequence. The loop starts from 2 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Determine the new value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the previous value of `n` + 1. This means the loop has just finished executing with `i` equal to the previous `n`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be the next integer in the sequence, which is `i + 1`.

2. **Adjust `n`:**
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop; it is only checked to determine if the loop should continue.

3. **Other variables (`t`, `k`, `best`, `res`):**
   - These variables are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the next iteration.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the previous value of `n` + 1 if `res` equals '<', otherwise `k` remains 1, `i` is the previous value of `n` + 2, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `previous n-1`) for which the response was '<', `res` is the user input.**

However, since `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value (which is the previous `n`), the correct state should reflect that `i` is now `i + 1` or equivalently, `previous n + 1` + 1 = `previous n + 2`.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the previous value of `n` + 1 if `res` equals '<', otherwise `k` remains 1, `i` is the previous value of `n` + 2, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `previous n-1`) for which the response was '<', `res` is the user input.**
