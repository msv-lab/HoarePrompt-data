The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` will change based on the input, while the other variables (`t`, `k`, `i`, and `best`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is greater than 1
- `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'` or 1 if no such index exists
- `i` is `n`
- `best` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such index exists

After executing the line `n = int(input())`, the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is provided as input. The other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'` or 1 if no such index exists, `i` is `n`, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such index exists.**
