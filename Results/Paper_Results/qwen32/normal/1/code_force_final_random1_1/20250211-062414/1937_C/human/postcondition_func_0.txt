The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a permutation `p` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. For each test case, it outputs two integers `k` and `best` that represent specific indices in the permutation `p`. The function interacts with an external system by printing queries and reading responses to determine these indices.
