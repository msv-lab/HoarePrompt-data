The code snippet provided assigns a new value to `n` based on user input. This means the previous value of `n` is overwritten. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `i`, `best`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `k` remains the same, `i` is the previous value of `n`, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `previous n-1`) for which the response was '<'**.
