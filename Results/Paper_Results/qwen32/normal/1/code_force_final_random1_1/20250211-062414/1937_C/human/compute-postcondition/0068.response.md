The code snippet `res = input()` assigns the value of user input to the variable `res`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change in the state is the assignment of `res`.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`, `i` is 2, `best` is 1 if `res` equals `'<'`, otherwise `best` remains 0, and `res` is the user input.**
