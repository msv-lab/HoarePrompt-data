The given code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `k`. However, the initial state does not specify any value for `i`. Therefore, we can only state that `k` now holds whatever value `i` held before the assignment. The values of `n` and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `res` is an input string with the current value of `<`; `k` is equal to `i`.**
