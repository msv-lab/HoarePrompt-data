To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: Remains the same (value not specified, but it doesn't affect the print statement).
2. **`n`**: Must be greater than 1 (value not specified, but it doesn't affect the print statement directly).
3. **`k`**: The largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`. Since no specific responses have been given, we assume `k` has not been updated from its default value, which would typically be 0 or 1 if not explicitly set. However, since `k` is described as the largest index, and no such index has been found yet, `k` could reasonably be considered 1 (as the smallest valid index in this context).
4. **`i`**: Is explicitly set to 2.
5. **`best`**: Is set to 1 if `res` equals `'<'`, otherwise `best` remains 0. Since `res` is the user input and its value is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `best`. However, for the sake of providing a precise answer, we'll consider the two possible cases:
   - If `res` is `'<'`, then `best` is 1.
   - If `res` is anything other than `'<'`, then `best` is 0.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

This means the output will be:
- A literal `'?'`
- The value of `k`
- The value of `best`
- The value of `k` again
- The value of `i`

### Possible Outputs:
Given the uncertainty around `best` (which depends on the user input `res`), we need to consider both possibilities:

1. **If `res` is `'<'`:**
   - `best` will be 1.
   - Assuming `k` is 1 (as reasoned above), the output will be:
     ```
     ? 1 1 1 2
     ```

2. **If `res` is anything other than `'<'`:**
   - `best` will be 0.
   - Assuming `k` is 1, the output will be:
     ```
     ? 1 0 1 2
     ```

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we must account for both scenarios. However, the question asks for the most precise description possible based on the given information. Therefore, we should describe the output in a way that includes both possibilities.

### Final Answer:
Output: **? 1 [best] 1 2 (where [best] is 1 if res is '<', otherwise 0)**
