To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variable `t`:** It remains the same but its value is not specified in the initial state, so it does not affect the print statement directly.
2. **Variable `n`:** It must be greater than 1, but its exact value is not specified.
3. **Variable `k`:** It is described as the largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`. Since no specific value for `k` is given, we can infer from the context that `k` is determined by the logic of the program but isn't explicitly stated. However, since `k` is used in the print statement, we'll assume it has been set to some valid value according to the program's logic.
4. **Variable `i`:** It is explicitly stated to be 3.
5. **Variable `best`:** Its value depends on the value of `res`. If `res` equals `'<'`, then `best` is set to 2; otherwise, `best` remains 0. Since the value of `res` is not provided, we cannot definitively say whether `best` is 2 or 0. However, we can describe the output in terms of `best`.

Given these details, the print statement will output the values of `k`, `best`, `k`, and `i` in the specified order.

Output: **? [k] [best] [k] 3 (where k is the largest index i from 2 to n-1 for which the response was '<', and best is 2 if res equals '<'; otherwise, best is 0)**
