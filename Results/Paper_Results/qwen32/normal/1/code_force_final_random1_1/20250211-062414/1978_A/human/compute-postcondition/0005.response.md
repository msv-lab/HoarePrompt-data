The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop will execute as long as the current iteration count is less than `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. The loop variable `_` would have taken on values from 0 up to the current iteration minus one. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` should be incremented by 1.

Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the state of `t` or `nums`, we only need to adjust `_` to reflect the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is the integer provided by the user input, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `_` is the current iteration count incremented by 1**
