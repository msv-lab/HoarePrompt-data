Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list where the first element is an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two parts: the first part is a pair of integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of cows and `k` is the index of the cow owned by the player. The second part is a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The function processes each test case and returns different values based on specific conditions involving the index `k` and the sorted order of the ratings. The possible return values are described in seven cases: Case_1 returns `n - 1`, Case_2 returns `k - 1`, Case_3 returns a value from the list `ind` minus 1, Case_4 returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, Case_5 returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`, Case_6 returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`, and Case_7 returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.**
