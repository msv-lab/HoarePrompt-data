Postcondition: **`a` is a list where the first element is an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is the rating of the cow owned by the player for the current test case, which is `a[k]`. If `a[i]` is greater than `x`, then `ind` is a list containing the index `i` and `c` is 1. Otherwise, `ind` remains an empty list and `c` remains 0. Additionally, `c` is currently equal to 2.**
