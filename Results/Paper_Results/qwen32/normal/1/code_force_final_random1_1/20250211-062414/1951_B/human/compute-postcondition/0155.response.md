The given code snippet is `p = j`. This line assigns the value of `j` to `p`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is the list of integers read from the input with `s[0]` swapped with `s[k-1]`; `h` is the value of `s[0]`; `j` is the index of the last element compared to `h` before the loop breaks or completes; `p` is the value of `j`; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `ans1` is the same as `ans`; `z` is 1 if `h` is encountered in `s[1:]`, otherwise 0.**
