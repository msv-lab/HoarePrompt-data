The code snippet provided increments the variable `ans1` by 1. No other variables are modified in the given code snippet.

Given the initial state, the only change is the increment of `ans1`. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is the list of integers read from the input with `s[0]` and `s[k-1]` swapped and must have at least one element; `h` is the original value of `s[k-1]`; `j` is the index of the last element processed in `s[1:]` minus 1; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `p` is the value of `j`; `z` is either 0 or 1; if `i` equals `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` remains 0, and `z` is set to 1; if `i` does not equal `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` was 1 and `i` is less than or equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` remains 0; `i` is `s[j + 2]` if `j + 2` is a valid index in `s`; `ans1` is incremented by 1.**
