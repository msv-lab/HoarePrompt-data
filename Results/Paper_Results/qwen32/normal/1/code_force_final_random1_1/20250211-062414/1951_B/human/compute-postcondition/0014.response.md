Postcondition: **`a` is a list where the first element is an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `x` is the rating of the cow owned by the player for the current test case, which is `a[k]`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `a[i]` is greater than `x`, `ind` includes the current value of `i` and `c` is incremented by 1.**
