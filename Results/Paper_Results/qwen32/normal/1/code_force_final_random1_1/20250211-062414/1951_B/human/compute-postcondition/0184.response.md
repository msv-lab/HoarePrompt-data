The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the list `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to reflect the next element in the list `s` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `s` is a list of integers read from the input with `s[p]` swapped with `s[k-1]` and must have at least one element.
- `h` is the value of `s[0]` (before the swap).
- `j` is the index of the last element compared to `h` before the loop breaks or completes, incremented by 1.
- `p` is the value of `j`.
- `i` is `s[j]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `s[j]`. For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1, and `i` should take the value of `s[j]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` and `k` remain the same.
- `s` remains the same.
- `h` remains the same.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `p` remains the same (since `p` is set to `j` at the end of the previous iteration and does not change during the loop).
- `i` is updated to `s[j]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is a list of integers read from the input with `s[p]` swapped with `s[k-1]` and must have at least one element; `h` is the value of `s[0]` (before the swap); `j` is the index of the last element compared to `h` before the loop breaks or completes, incremented by 1; `p` is the value of `j`; `i` is `s[j]`**.
