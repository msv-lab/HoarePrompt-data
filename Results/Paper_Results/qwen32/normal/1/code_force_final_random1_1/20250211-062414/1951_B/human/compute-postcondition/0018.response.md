The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `ind`. The values of `a`, `n`, `x`, and `t` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ind` now includes the new element `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a list where the first element is an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is the rating of the cow owned by the player for the current test case, which is `a[k]`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ind` now includes the new element `i`.**
