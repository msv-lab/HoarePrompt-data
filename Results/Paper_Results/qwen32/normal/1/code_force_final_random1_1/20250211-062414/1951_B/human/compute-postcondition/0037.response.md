Given the initial state, `ind` is a list containing exactly one index of a cow with a higher rating than `x`, and `c` is 1. The first element of `ind` is not 0 and is less than or equal to `k`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
```

We need to determine the value returned by this code based on the given conditions.

- `ind[0]` is the first (and only) element in the list `ind`.
- `ind[0]` is not 0.
- `ind[0]` is less than or equal to `k`.

Let's denote the value of `ind[0]` as `i`. Therefore, `i` is not 0 and `i <= k`.

The expression inside the `max` function is `max(k - i, i - 1)`.

Since `i` is not 0, `i - 1` is a valid integer. Also, since `i <= k`, `k - i` is also a non-negative integer.

To determine which value `max(k - i, i - 1)` will return, we need to consider two cases:

1. If `k - i >= i - 1`, then `max(k - i, i - 1)` returns `k - i`.
2. If `k - i < i - 1`, then `max(k - i, i - 1)` returns `i - 1`.

However, without specific values for `k` and `i`, we cannot definitively say which case applies. But we can express the output in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **The program returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the first element of the list `ind` and is not 0 and is less than or equal to `k`.**
