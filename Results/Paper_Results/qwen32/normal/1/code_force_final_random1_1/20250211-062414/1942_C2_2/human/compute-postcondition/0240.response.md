The given code snippet updates the value of `gap` based on the current values of `next_elem`, `a[i]`, and subtracts 1 from their difference. Since `i` is defined as `x-1`, we can substitute `i` with `x-1` in the equation.

Given:
- `i` is `x-1`
- `gap` is calculated as `next_elem - a[x-1] - 1`

After executing the line `gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1`, the new value of `gap` will be `next_elem - a[x-1] - 1`.

Other variables (`ans`, `odd`, `even`, `next_elem`, `x`) remain unchanged unless they are modified elsewhere in the code, which is not shown here.

Output State: **`i` is `x-1`, `x` must be greater than 0, `ans` is incremented based on certain conditions, `odd` and `even` lists are populated based on the value of `gap`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[x-1] - 1`.**
