Postcondition: **`tt` must be greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is `i + 2`. If `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `tmp` includes the new element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `ans` is updated by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is reduced by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, none of these changes occur.**
