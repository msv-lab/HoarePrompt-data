The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only terminates the nearest enclosing loop. Given that no loop is explicitly mentioned in the context, we assume that the `break` statement is intended to exit a loop structure that surrounds this code snippet.

Therefore, the values of `i`, `ans`, `odd`, `even`, `gap`, and `y` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is `x`; `ans` is incremented by `2 * gap + 4 * y` if `y < gap // 2` initially, otherwise `ans` is incremented by `2 * gap + 2 * y`; `odd` contains at least two odd gaps greater than 1 and is sorted; `even` contains all even gaps greater than 0 and is sorted; `gap` is the next element in `odd`; `y` is `0`.**
