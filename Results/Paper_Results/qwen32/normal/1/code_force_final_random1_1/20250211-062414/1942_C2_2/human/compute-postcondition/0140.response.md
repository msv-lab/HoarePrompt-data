The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the elements in the list `val`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `i` changes and what the implications are for the loop continuing.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken on the value of the last element processed in `val`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to the next element in `val`.

Given:
- `val` is a sorted list of `x` elements.
- The loop iterates over each element in `val`.

Let's denote the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `val[k]`. For the next iteration, `i` should be set to `val[k+1]`.

Since we don't know the exact position `k` of the last processed element, we can infer that `i` should simply be the next element in `val` after the current `i`.

Therefore, if `i` was `val[k]` at the end of the last iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `val[k+1]`.

However, since we don't have the specific value of `k`, we can generalize this by saying that `i` should be the next element in `val` after its current value.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `x` is at least 1, `n` and `y` are the values returned by `R()` with `y` updated to `y - c`, `l` is a sorted list returned by `R()` with at least two elements (including the additional element `n + l[0]` appended), `val` is a non-empty sorted list of `x` elements where each element is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `x` (sorted first by evenness and then by value), and `sx` and `cons` are calculated based on the conditions involving `y` and `c` as described, `i` is the next element in `val` after its current value**.
