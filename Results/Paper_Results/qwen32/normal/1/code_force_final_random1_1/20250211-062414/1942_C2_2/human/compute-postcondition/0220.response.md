To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `i` and `x`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.
- The loop condition is `for i in range(x)`.

This means that at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`
   - `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`
   - If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is incremented by 1.

2. **Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again to reflect the next index in the loop.
   - Therefore, `i` should be `i + 2` at the start of the next iteration.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < x`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `t1` is `(a[i + 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i + 1] + 2) % n`, `x` remains unchanged**.

However, since `t1` and `t2` are calculated based on the current value of `i` and will be recalculated at the start of the next iteration, they do not need to be explicitly mentioned in the state unless required by the problem context. Therefore, the essential part of the state to adjust is `i`.

Final State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `x` remains unchanged**.
