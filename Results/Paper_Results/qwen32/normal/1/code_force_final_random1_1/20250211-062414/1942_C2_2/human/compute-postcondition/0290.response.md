Postcondition: **`even` contains at least one even number greater than 0 and is sorted; `gap` is the next value in the list `even` after the current `gap`. If `y < gap // 2`, then `ans` is increased by `2 * y` and `y` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans` or `y`.**
