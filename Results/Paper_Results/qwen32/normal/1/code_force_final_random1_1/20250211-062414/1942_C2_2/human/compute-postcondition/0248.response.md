The given code snippet appends the value of `gap` to the `odd` list. Since the code only modifies the `odd` list, the values of `i`, `x`, `ans`, `next_elem`, and `gap` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is incremented based on certain conditions, `next_elem` is `a[1]` if `i < x - 1` otherwise `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[0] - 1`, the `odd` list includes the new element `gap`.**
