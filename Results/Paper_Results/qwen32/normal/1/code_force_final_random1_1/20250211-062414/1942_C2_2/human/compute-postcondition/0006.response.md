The code snippet only initializes an empty list named `tmp`. None of the other variables (`tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `ans`) are affected.

Output State: **`tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is `x + y - 2`; `tmp` is an empty list.**
