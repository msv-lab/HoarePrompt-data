The code snippet `odd.append(gap)` adds the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `gap` is calculated as `next_elem - a[x-1] - 1`, where `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`. The values of `i`, `x`, `ans`, `even`, `next_elem`, and `gap` remain unchanged except for the `odd` list, which now includes the new element `gap`.

Output State: **`i` is `x-1`, `x` must be greater than 0, `ans` is incremented based on certain conditions, `odd` and `even` lists are populated based on the value of `gap`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[x-1] - 1`, `odd` list includes the new element `gap`.**
