The code snippet provided increments the variable `ans` by 1. The other variables (`tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `i`) are not modified by this code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `tt` must be greater than 0
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input
- `a` is a sorted list of integers with `len(a) > 1`
- `i` is `i + 2`

After executing `ans += 1`, the value of `ans` is increased by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with `len(a) > 1`; `i` is `i + 2`; `ans` is increased by 1.**
