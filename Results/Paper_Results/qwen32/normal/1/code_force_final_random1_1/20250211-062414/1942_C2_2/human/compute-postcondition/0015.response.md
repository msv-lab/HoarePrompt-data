Postcondition: **`tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements; the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `tmp` is a list containing the single element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `y`, `ans`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.**
