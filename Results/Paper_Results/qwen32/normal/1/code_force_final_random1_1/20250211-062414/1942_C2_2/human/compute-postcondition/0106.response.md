Postcondition: **`tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input with at least 2 elements; `ii` is incremented by 2; `tmp` contains `[(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2]` if the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is true and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2, otherwise `tmp` remains unchanged; `ans` is updated to `ans + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if the condition is true, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1; `y` is decreased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` if the condition is true, otherwise `y` remains unchanged.**
