Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer read from the input, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. Additionally, the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, x, y = R()
    sx = 0
    l = list(R())
    l.sort()
    l.append(n + l[0])
    val = []
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
        if c == 1:
            sx += 1
        val.append(c)
    val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
    for i in val:
        c = i // 2
        if y < c:
            sx += y * 2
            break
        sx += i
        y -= c
    cons = x + sx - 2
    cons = min(n - 2, cons)
    print(cons)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values returned by `R()`, except `y` is now `y - (i // 2) - (i // 4) - ... - (i // (2^(x-1)))` or `y - (i // 2) - (i // 4) - ... - (i // (2^k))` if the loop breaks early; `l` is `[min(n, x, y), middle(n, x, y), max(n, x, y), n + min(n, x, y)]`; `val` is `[c, c, ..., c]` (x times); `sx` is the sum of the series `i + i//2 + i//4 + ... + i//(2^(x-1))` or `i + i//2 + ... + i//(2^k) + y * 2` if the loop breaks early; `cons` is `min(n - 2, cons)`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is decreased by 1, `x`, `n` are unchanged, `y` is reduced by the sum of `i // 2` for all `i` in `val`, `l` remains the sorted list with the additional element, `val` remains the same list of differences, `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val`, `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is unchanged, `cons` is `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
