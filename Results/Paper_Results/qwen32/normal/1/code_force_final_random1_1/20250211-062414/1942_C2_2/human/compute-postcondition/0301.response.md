To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to know the value of the variable `ans`. However, the initial state provided does not specify any details about the variable `ans`. Therefore, we cannot determine its explicit value based on the given information.

Given this lack of specific information about `ans`, the most precise description we can provide is that the print statement will output whatever value `ans` holds at the time of execution.

Output: **ans (where ans is the value of the variable ans)**
