Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three additional integers: `n`, `x`, and `y`. Here, `n` is the total number of vertices, `x` is the number of chosen vertices, and `y` is a specific integer related to the problem's constraints. It also receives a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
