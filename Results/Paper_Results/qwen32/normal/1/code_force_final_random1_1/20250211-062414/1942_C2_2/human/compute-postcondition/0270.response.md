The only variable in the loop head is `gap`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `odd` list. Since `gap` is the next element in `odd`, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `odd`.

At the end of the last iteration, `gap` was the current element from `odd`, and it has been processed. For the next iteration, `gap` should be the next element in the `odd` list.

Given that `odd` contains at least one odd gap greater than 1 and is sorted, and `gap` is the next element in `odd`, we need to ensure that there is another element in `odd` for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is `x`; `ans` is incremented by `2 * gap` (or `ans` is incremented by `2 * gap + 2 * y` if `y < gap // 2` initially); `odd` contains at least two odd gaps greater than 1 and is sorted; `even` contains all even gaps greater than 0 and is sorted; `gap` is the next element in `odd`; `y` is `-gap // 2` if initially `y < gap // 2`.**
