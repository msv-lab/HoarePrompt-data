Postcondition: **`tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with `len(a) > 1`; the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2; `ii` is incremented by 1; `tmp` is either an empty list or a list containing `[(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2]`; if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)` and `ans` is `x + y - 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`; otherwise, `ans` remains `x + y - 2` and `tmp` remains an empty list.**
