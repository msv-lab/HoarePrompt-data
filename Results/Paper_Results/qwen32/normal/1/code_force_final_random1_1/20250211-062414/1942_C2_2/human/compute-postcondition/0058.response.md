Postcondition: **`tt` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with `len(a) > 1`; `ii` is incremented by 1; `tmp` is either an empty list or a list containing `[(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2]`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is exactly 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 1`. If the difference is not 2, `tmp` is updated as described, and `ans` is adjusted based on the conditions involving `y` and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.**
