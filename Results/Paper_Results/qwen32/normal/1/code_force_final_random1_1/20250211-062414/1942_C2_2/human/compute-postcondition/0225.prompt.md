Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is `x - 2`; `y` is reduced by the sum of `gap // 2` for the first `processed_gaps` elements in `even`; `odd`, `i`, `next_elem`, `t`, `even` retain their original values; `n`, `x`, `y` are updated to the values read from the input; `t` is decremented by 1; `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`; `st` is a set of the elements in the list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
    t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
    if t1 not in st and t2 in st:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is `x - 1` if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x - 2`. `y` is updated to the value read from the input, `t` is decremented by 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`, `st` is a set of the elements in the list `a`, and `even`, `odd`, `i`, `next_elem`, `n`, `x`, `t1`, and `t2` retain their original values except as specified.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `i + 1`; `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`; `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`. If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 2`, `x` remains unchanged, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`. If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, `ans` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
