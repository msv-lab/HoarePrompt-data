Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 3; `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 3. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1; otherwise, if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If none of these conditions are met, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
