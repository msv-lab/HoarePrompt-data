The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**
