Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `aOnes` is 0; `bOnes` is 0; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 1; `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`; either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is greater than `newk`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables. It only causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
