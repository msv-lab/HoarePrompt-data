Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input where `k` must be at least 3; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 3; `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged unless specific conditions are met. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then if `aOnes` was less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is increased by 1; otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, otherwise `aOnes` remains unchanged; `bOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` is not in `a` and `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, otherwise `bOnes` remains unchanged.**
