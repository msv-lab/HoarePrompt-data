Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 3; `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change except for the control flow, which breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
