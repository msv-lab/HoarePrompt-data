In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `t`, and the loop will execute based on the value of `t`.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that the loop will definitely execute because `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1.

However, since the task specifies that we should only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (which is just `t` in this case), and `t` is already within the valid range, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state remains as provided:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
