The initial state provides us with several variables and their relationships, but the key point to focus on for this specific print statement is the content of the print statement itself. The print statement is:

```python
print('yes')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'yes'`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `newk`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`) affect the output of this particular print statement because the string `'yes'` is explicitly provided.

Thus, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
