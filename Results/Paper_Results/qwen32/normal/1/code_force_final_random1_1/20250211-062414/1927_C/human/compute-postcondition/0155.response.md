Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 2; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `i` is 3; `newk` is `k // 2`. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains unchanged. `aOnes` is either 0, 1, or incremented by 1 if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`.**
