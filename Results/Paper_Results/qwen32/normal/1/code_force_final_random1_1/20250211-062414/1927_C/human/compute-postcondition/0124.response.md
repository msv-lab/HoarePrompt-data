Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 1; `i` is in both `a` and `b`. If `aOnes` was initially less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is now 1 and `bOnes` is 0. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1.**
