Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `aOnes` is 0; `bOnes` is 1; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 1 and `i` is present in both `a` and `b`; `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`.**

Explanation: The value of `bOnes` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
