To determine what will be printed when the `print(start)` statement is executed, let's break down the initial state provided:

1. `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`.
2. `nums` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr` with the counts of elements from 0 to `start` appropriately decreased.
3. `start` is the last value that had a non-zero count in `nums`.
4. `vis` is a set containing the values from 0 to `start - 1`.

Given this information, the `start` variable holds the last index up to which the counts have been adjusted in the `nums` counter. This means that all elements from `0` to `start` have been processed and their counts in `nums` have been decremented accordingly.

When the `print(start)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `start`.

Since the exact value of `start` is not explicitly provided in the initial state, we can only describe it based on the conditions given. `start` is the highest index for which the count in `nums` was non-zero after processing.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `start` as described.

Output: **start (where start is the last value that had a non-zero count in nums)**
