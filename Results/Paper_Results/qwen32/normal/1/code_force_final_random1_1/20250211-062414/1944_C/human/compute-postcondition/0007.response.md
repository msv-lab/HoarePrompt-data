The code snippet `nums[start + 1] -= 1` decrements the count of the element at index `start + 1` in the `nums` Counter object by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`, with at least one 0 in `arr`.
- `nums` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0]` decreased by 1.
- `start` is 0 and `nums[start + 1]` is greater than 0.
- `vis` is a set containing the value 0.

After executing the code snippet, `nums[start + 1]` (which is `nums[1]`) will be decreased by 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`, with at least one 0 in `arr`; `nums` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0]` decreased by 1 and `nums[1]` decreased by 1; `start` is 0; `vis` is a set containing the value 0.**
