Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob to achieve their respective goals of maximizing and minimizing the MEX of the array `c`.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Strategy Implementation**: The function `func_1` only considers removing elements sequentially from `start` upwards without considering the optimal moves for Alice and Bob. It simply removes elements starting from 0 and increments the `start` whenever possible, which does not account for the strategic choices that both players would make.

2. **Lack of Turn-Based Logic**: The game involves turns where Alice and Bob alternate moves. The current implementation does not simulate these turns and does not account for the fact that Alice wants to maximize the MEX while Bob wants to minimize it.

3. **No Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where certain numbers are missing or where the distribution of numbers allows Bob to force a lower MEX regardless of Alice's moves.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
1
5
0 0 1 1 2
```

The optimal game could be:
- Alice picks 2, `c = [2]`, `a = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
- Bob picks 0, `c = [2]`, `a = [0, 1, 1]`
- Alice picks 1, `c = [2, 1]`, `a = [0, 1]`
- Bob picks 0, `c = [2, 1]`, `a = [1]`
- Alice picks 1, `c = [2, 1, 1]`, `a = []`

The MEX of `[2, 1, 1]` is `0`, but the program might output `3` or some other incorrect value.

Thus, the program does not correctly simulate the game and does not guarantee the optimal MEX for every case. Therefore, it is incorrect.
