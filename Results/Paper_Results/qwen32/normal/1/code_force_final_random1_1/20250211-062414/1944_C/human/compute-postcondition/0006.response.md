Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`, with at least one 0 in `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0]` decreased by 1. `start` is 0 and `nums[start + 1]` is greater than 0. `vis` is a set containing the value 0.**
