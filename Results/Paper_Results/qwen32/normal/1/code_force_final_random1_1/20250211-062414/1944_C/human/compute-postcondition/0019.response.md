Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`, with at least one 0 in `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0]` decreased by 1, `nums[1]` is 1 or more, and `nums[2]` is decreased by 1 if `nums[start + 1]` was non-zero (i.e., `nums[2]` is decreased by 1 if `nums[3]` was non-zero initially). `start` is 2 if `nums[start + 1]` was non-zero, otherwise `start` remains 1. `vis` is a set containing the values 0 and 1. If `nums[start + 1]` was non-zero, the program does not return anything (None); otherwise, the program returns nothing (None).**
