The code snippet `nums[start + 1] -= 1` decrements the count of the element at index `start + 1` in the `nums` Counter object by 1. Given that `start` is 1, this operation affects `nums[2]`.

Since `nums[1]` was initially 2 or more and is now 1 or more, the decrement operation does not affect `nums[1]`. The only change is to `nums[2]`, which is reduced by 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`, with at least one 0 in `arr`; `nums` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0]` decreased by 1, `nums[1]` is 1 or more, and `nums[2]` is decreased by 1; `start` is 1; `vis` is a set containing the values 0 and 1.**
