Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`, with at least one 0 in `arr`; `nums` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0]` decreased by 1 and `nums[1]` initially being 2 or more, now `nums[1]` is 1 or more; `start` is 1; `vis` is a set containing the values 0 and 1.**

Explanation: The value of `nums[start]` (which is `nums[1]`) is decremented by 1. Since `start` is 1 and `nums[1]` was initially 2 or more, after the operation, `nums[1]` becomes 1 or more. All other variables remain unchanged.
