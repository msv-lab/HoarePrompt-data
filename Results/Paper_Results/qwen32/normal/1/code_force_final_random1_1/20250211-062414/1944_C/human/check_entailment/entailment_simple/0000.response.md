### Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by simulating the game between Alice and Bob and calculating the MEX of the resulting array `c`. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Counting Elements**:
   - A `Counter` object `nums` is used to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.

3. **Simulating the Game**:
   - The variable `start` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the current smallest non-negative integer that is being considered.
   - A set `vis` is used to keep track of the integers that have been added to `c` so far.
   - The while loop continues as long as the count of the current `start` value in `nums` is greater than 0.
     - If `start` is present in `nums`, it is added to `vis` and its count in `nums` is decremented.
     - The program then checks if `start + 1` is present in `nums`. If it is, its count is decremented and `start` is incremented.
     - If `start + 1` is not present in `nums`, the program prints `start + 1` and exits the loop. This is because `start + 1` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `vis`, which is the MEX of `c`.

4. **Output**:
   - If the loop completes without finding a missing integer, the program prints `start`. This means that all integers from 0 to `start - 1` are in `vis`, and `start` is the next integer that is not in `vis`, which is the MEX of `c`.

### Analysis:

- The logic correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` by maintaining a count of each element and simulating the game's effect on the array.
- The use of a `Counter` to keep track of the counts of each element ensures that the program efficiently checks the presence and updates the count of elements.
- The while loop correctly handles the game dynamics, ensuring that the smallest missing integer is found after simulating the optimal moves by Alice and Bob.
- The output matches the expected results for the given examples, indicating that the program is functioning as intended.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and produces the desired output for the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
