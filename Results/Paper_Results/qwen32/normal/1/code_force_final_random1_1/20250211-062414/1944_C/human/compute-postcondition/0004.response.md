Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`, with at least one 0 in `arr`; `nums` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0] > 0`; `start` is 0; `vis` is a set containing the value 0.**

Explanation: The variable `vis` is updated to include the value of `start`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
