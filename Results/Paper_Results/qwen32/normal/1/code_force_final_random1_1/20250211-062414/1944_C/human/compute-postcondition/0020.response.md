To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while nums.get(start, 0):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue as long as `nums[start]` is non-zero.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition depends on `nums[start]`.
- `start` can either be 1 or 2 based on the initial conditions:
  - `start` is 2 if `nums[start + 1]` (which is `nums[3]`) was non-zero initially.
  - Otherwise, `start` remains 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `nums[start]` must be non-zero.
- Since `start` can be either 1 or 2, we need to ensure `nums[1]` or `nums[2]` is non-zero.

### Given Information:
- `nums[0]` is decreased by 1.
- `nums[1]` is 1 or more.
- `nums[2]` is decreased by 1 if `nums[start + 1]` was non-zero (i.e., `nums[3]` was non-zero initially).

### Conclusion:
- Since `nums[1]` is explicitly stated to be 1 or more, ensuring `nums[1]` is non-zero is straightforward.
- For `nums[2]`, if it was decreased by 1, it must have been non-zero initially. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure `nums[2]` is non-zero.

### Final State Adjustment:
- Ensure `nums[1]` remains non-zero (it's already stated to be 1 or more).
- Ensure `nums[2]` is non-zero if it was decreased by 1 (it must have been non-zero initially).

Given these points, the state does not need further adjustment since `nums[1]` is guaranteed to be non-zero, and `nums[2]` will be non-zero if it was decreased by 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`, with at least one 0 in `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0]` decreased by 1, `nums[1]` is 1 or more, and `nums[2]` is decreased by 1 if `nums[start + 1]` was non-zero. `start` is 2 if `nums[start + 1]` was non-zero, otherwise `start` remains 1. `vis` is a set containing the values 0 and 1. If `nums[start + 1]` was non-zero, the program does not return anything (None); otherwise, the program returns nothing (None).**
