The given code updates the value of `d2[i]` based on the values in the list `l` and the previously computed value of `d2[i + 1]`. Specifically, `d2[4]` is updated using the values of `l[4]`, `l[3]`, and `d2[5]`.

Given:
- `i` is 4
- `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`, meaning `d2[i]` defaults to 0 if not set.

The new value of `d2[4]` is calculated as:
\[ d2[4] = l[4] - l[3] + d2[5] \]

Since `d2[5]` is not specified and defaults to 0 (as per the defaultdict behavior), the equation simplifies to:
\[ d2[4] = l[4] - l[3] \]

Therefore, the value of `d2[4]` is now `l[4] - l[3]`.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\), `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the differences in the list `l` for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \), `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d2[4]` is `l[4] - l[3]`, `i` is 4**.
