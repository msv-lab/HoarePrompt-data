Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: `i` is `3`, `n` is greater than `4`.

The code snippet modifies the dictionary `d1` by setting the value at key `i + 2` to `1 + d1[i + 1]`. 

Since `i` is `3`, the operation translates to setting `d1[5]` to `1 + d1[4]`.

This means the value at key `5` in `d1` is updated to be one more than the value at key `4` in `d1`.

The value of `i` remains `3`, and the condition `n` is greater than `4` still holds true.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `3`, `n` is greater than `4`, `d1[5]` is `1 + d1[4]`**.
