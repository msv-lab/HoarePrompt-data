Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\), `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the differences in the list `l` for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \), `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is set to 1. Additionally, for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-2 \), the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`.**
