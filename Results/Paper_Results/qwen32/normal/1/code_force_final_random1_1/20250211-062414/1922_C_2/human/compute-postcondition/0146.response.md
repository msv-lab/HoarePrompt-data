The given code modifies the value of `d2[i]` based on the values of `l[i]`, `l[i - 1]`, and `d2[i + 1]`. The value of `i` is initially `n - 4`, and `n` is at least `5`.

Given these conditions, the new value of `d2[i]` will be `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. No other variables are modified in this code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 4` and `n` is at least `5`; `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**
