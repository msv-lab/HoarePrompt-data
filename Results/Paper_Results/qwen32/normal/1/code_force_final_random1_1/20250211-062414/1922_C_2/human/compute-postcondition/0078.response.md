To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means the loop will iterate with `i` starting from `n - 2` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by `1` each time.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is a list of integers
- `d1` has keys from `3` to `n` with values calculated based on the differences in `l`
- `d2` has its value at key `n - 1` set to `1`

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `(n - 2, 0, -1)` is valid. This means `n - 2` should be greater than or equal to `1` (since the loop stops when `i` becomes `0`).
2. **Adjustments Needed**: To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least `3` because if `n` is `2`, `n - 2` would be `0`, and the loop wouldn't execute.

### Conclusion:
- `i` should be `n - 2` (as given).
- `n` must be at least `3` to ensure the loop executes.

The other variables (`l`, `d1`, `d2`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be at least 3, `l` is the same list of integers, `d1` has keys from `3` to `n` with values calculated based on the differences in `l`, `d2` has its value at key `n - 1` set to `1`**
