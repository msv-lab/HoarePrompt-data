Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 3\); `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int` where `d1[i + 2]` is either `1 + d1[i + 1]` if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, or `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]` otherwise; `d2` remains a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
