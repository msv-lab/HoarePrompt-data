Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 3; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`. If `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is less than `l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[2]` is 1 and `d1[i + 2]` is `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. `d2` remains a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`.**
