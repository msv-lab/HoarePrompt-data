Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly compute the minimum cost to travel between cities based on the given rules. The logic for calculating the costs using dictionaries `d1` and `d2` is flawed. Specifically, the dictionaries are supposed to store the minimum cost to reach each city from either direction, but they are incorrectly updated and used.

Here are some key issues with the code:
1. **Initialization and Update of Dictionaries**: The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are not initialized properly to handle all cities. They should store the minimum cost to reach each city from the left and right, respectively.
2. **Cost Calculation Logic**: The logic for updating the dictionaries does not correctly reflect the problem requirements. The cost to move to the closest city should be 1 coin, and moving directly to another city should be the absolute difference in their positions.
3. **Query Handling**: The code attempts to use the dictionaries to answer queries, but due to the incorrect updates, the results are not accurate.

To fix these issues, a different approach is needed. One possible solution involves precomputing the closest city for each city and then using dynamic programming or another method to efficiently answer the queries. However, the current implementation does not achieve this correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is False.
