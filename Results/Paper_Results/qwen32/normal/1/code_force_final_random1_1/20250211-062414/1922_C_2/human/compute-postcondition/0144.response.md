The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 2` down to `1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` should be one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `n - 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by `1`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `(n - 3) - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 4`.

Since `n` is at least `3`, `n - 4` will be at least `-1`, but because the loop condition is `i > 0`, the loop will not execute if `i` becomes `0` or less. Therefore, `n - 4` must be at least `1`, implying that `n` must be at least `5`.

State: **`i` is `n - 4` and `n` is at least `5`**
