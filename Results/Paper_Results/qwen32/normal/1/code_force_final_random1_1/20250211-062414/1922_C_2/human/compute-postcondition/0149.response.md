The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `m`. This means `m` will take the value of whatever integer is input by the user. The values of `i` and `d2` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is `0`; `d2` has been updated for all keys from `1` to `n - 2` based on the conditions `if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]` then `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]` else `d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`; `m` is an input integer.**
