The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration and continues as long as `i` is greater than 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `n - 3`.

The value of `n` remains unchanged, and it must still be at least 3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`i` is `n - 3` and `n` is at least `3`**
