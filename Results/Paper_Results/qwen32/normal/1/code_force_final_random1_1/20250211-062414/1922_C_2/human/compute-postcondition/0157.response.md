The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `m`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` for the next iteration of the loop. According to the `for` loop statement, `j` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration.

Given that `j` is `0` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `1` at the start of the next iteration. The value of `m` does not change; it remains the same as it determines the total number of iterations.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is `0`, `d2` has been updated for all keys from `1` to `n - 2` based on the conditions `if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]` then `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]` else `d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. `m` is greater than `0`, `x` is an input integer, and `y` is an input integer. If `y` is greater than `x`, then `y` remains greater than `x`. Otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`. `j` is `1`**
