In this task, the loop head contains the variable `i` and the range is determined by the input value, which we can denote as `input_value`. The loop counter `j` is not directly part of the loop head but rather keeps track of the number of completed iterations.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, where `j` is equal to `m` (indicating `m` iterations have completed), we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Since `i` is the loop counter in the `for` loop, it should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been `m - 1` (since `j` starts counting from 0). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `m`.

The `input_value` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

State: **The loop has completed `m` iterations, and the loop counter `j` is equal to `m`. The loop counter `i` is equal to `m`. The values of `x` and `y` from the last iteration are available but do not affect the overall state.** 

However, since we are only concerned with the objects in the loop head, we can simplify this to:

State: **`i` is equal to `m`.**
