The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n-2` (inclusive). 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `1` and `n` is greater than `2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by `1`, making it `2`. The value of `n` must still be greater than `3` to allow the loop to continue executing.

State: **`i` is `2`, `n` is greater than `3`**
