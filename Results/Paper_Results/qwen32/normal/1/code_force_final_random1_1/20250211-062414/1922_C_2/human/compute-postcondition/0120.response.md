The given code modifies the value of `d1[i + 2]` based on the current value of `d1[i + 1]`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and the list `l`) remain unchanged.

Given that `d1[i + 2]` is being set to `1 + d1[i + 1]`, we know that the new value of `d1[i + 2]` will be one more than its previous value.

Output State: **`i` is `1`, `n` is greater than `2`, the current value of `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is less than `l[i] - l[i - 1]`, `d1[i + 2]` is `1 + d1[i + 1]`.**
