Postcondition: **`i` is `m + 2`, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`, and `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`. If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[i + 2]` is `1`. Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.**
