To determine what will be printed by the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State Recap:
- `i` is `0`
- `n` is at least `3`
- `l` is a list of integers
- `d1` has keys from `3` to `n` with values calculated based on the differences in `l`
- `d2` has its value at key `n - 1` set to `1` and its values at keys from `n - 2` down to `1` set according to specific conditions in a loop
- `m` is greater than `0`
- `x` is `x_new`
- `y` is `y_new`
- `j` is `2`
- If `y_new` is greater than `x_new`, then `y_new` is greater than `x_new`. Otherwise, `y_new` is less than or equal to `x_new`

### Analysis:
The `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement depends on the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`. To understand these values, we need to know how `d2` is constructed.

From the initial state, we know:
- `d2[n - 1] = 1`
- For keys from `n - 2` down to `1`, the values are set according to conditions in a loop. However, the exact formula or condition isn't provided, so we'll denote these values generally.

Given that `x` is `x_new` and `y` is `y_new`, and considering the condition that if `y_new > x_new`, then `y_new` is greater than `x_new`; otherwise, `y_new` is less than or equal to `x_new`, we can infer that `y` and `x` are keys in the dictionary `d2`.

Without the exact formula for setting `d2` values, we can only say that `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are values associated with keys `y` and `x` respectively in the dictionary `d2`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement will be the difference between the values stored in `d2` at keys `y` and `x`. Since the exact values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` depend on the construction of `d2` within the loop, we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, we can describe the output in terms of the dictionary `d2`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] and d2[x] are the values in the dictionary d2 at keys y and x respectively)**
