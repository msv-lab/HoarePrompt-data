Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 3, `l` remains the same list of integers, `d1` has keys from `3` to `n` with values calculated based on the differences in `l`. `d2` has its value at key `n - 1` set to `1` and its value at key `n - 2` set to `2` if `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`. Otherwise, `d2` has its value at key `n - 2` set to `l[n - 2] - l[n - 3] + 1`.**
