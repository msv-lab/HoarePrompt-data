Postcondition: **`i` is `0`, `n` is at least `3`, `l` remains the same list of integers, `d1` has keys from `3` to `n` with values calculated based on the differences in `l`, `d2` has its value at key `n - 1` set to `1` and its values at keys from `n - 2` down to `1` set according to the conditions specified in the loop, `m` must be greater than `0`, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer, and `y` is greater than `x`.**
