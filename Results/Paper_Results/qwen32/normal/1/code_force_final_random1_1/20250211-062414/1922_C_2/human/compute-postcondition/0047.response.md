To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input.
- There is a dictionary `d1` that is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is assumed to exist and contain keys corresponding to the values of `x` and `y`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables `x` and `y`:**
   - `x` and `y` are integers that have been inputted into the program. Their specific values are not provided, so we'll refer to them as `x` and `y`.

2. **Dictionary `d1`:**
   - `d1` is a dictionary that contains keys which include `x` and `y`.
   - The values associated with these keys (`d1[x]` and `d1[y]`) are not specified, so we'll denote them as `d1[x]` and `d1[y]`.

3. **Expression `d1[y] - d1[x]`:**
   - This expression calculates the difference between the value of `d1` at key `y` and the value of `d1` at key `x`.
   - Since the exact values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` are not provided, we can only express the output in terms of these values.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the difference between the value of `d1` at key `y` and the value of `d1` at key `x`.

### Final Output:
Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1 is a dictionary containing keys x and y with their respective values)**
