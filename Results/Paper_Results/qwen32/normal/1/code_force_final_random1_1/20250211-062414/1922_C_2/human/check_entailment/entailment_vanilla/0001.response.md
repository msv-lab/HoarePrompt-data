### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Step 1: Input Parsing
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, their positions `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.

#### Step 2: Closest City Calculation
- The program uses a function `func_1` to determine the closest city for each city in the list.
- `func_1` calculates the closest city for each city in the list by comparing the distances to the previous and next city.
- It returns a list where each element indicates the cost to travel to the closest city (either 1 if the closest city is the next one, or the actual distance if the closest city is the previous one).

#### Step 3: Prefix Sum Calculation
- The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward directions.
- `pref_sum_f` stores the cumulative cost to reach each city from the start using the closest city strategy.
- `pref_sum_b` stores the cumulative cost to reach each city from the end using the closest city strategy.

#### Step 4: Query Processing
- For each query, the program determines the cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`.
- If `a < b`, it uses `pref_sum_f` to calculate the cost.
- If `a > b`, it uses `pref_sum_b` to calculate the cost.

#### Issues and Corrections:
- The `func_1` function seems to be incorrectly implemented. Specifically, the logic for determining the closest city is flawed.
- The function should return 1 if the next city is closer, otherwise, it should return the distance to the previous city.
- However, the current implementation returns the distance to the next city when it should return 1.

### Correct Implementation of `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999
        forward = 99999999
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(cities[i] - back)
    return prog_cities
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program has an error in the `func_1` function, which affects the correctness of the prefix sum calculations and, consequently, the results of the queries.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
