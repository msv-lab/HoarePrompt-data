To determine the output of the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the implications of the variables involved:

1. **Variables and Initial State:**
   - `i` is initialized to `0`.
   - `n` is at least `3`.
   - `l` is a list of integers.
   - `d1` is a dictionary with keys from `3` to `n`, where the values are calculated based on differences in `l`.
   - `d2` is a dictionary with its value at key `n - 1` set to `1` and its values at keys from `n - 2` down to `1` set according to specific conditions in a loop.
   - `m` must be greater than `0`.
   - `x` is the first input integer.
   - `y` is the second input integer, and `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Understanding `d2`:**
   - `d2[n-1]` is explicitly set to `1`.
   - For keys from `n-2` down to `1`, the values of `d2` are determined by the conditions inside the loop, but these conditions are not explicitly detailed in the problem statement. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of `d2[k]` for `k < n-1` without more information.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print` statement calculates `d2[y] - d2[x]`.
   - Given that `y` is less than or equal to `x`, and without knowing the specific values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` for `y` and `x` less than `n-1`, we can only describe the output in terms of these values.

Since we do not have the exact values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` for `y` and `x` less than `n-1`, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] and d2[x] are values in the dictionary d2 corresponding to the keys y and x respectively)**
