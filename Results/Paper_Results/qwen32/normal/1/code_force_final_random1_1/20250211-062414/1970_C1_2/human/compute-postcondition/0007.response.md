In the given for loop, the loop variable is `_`, and it iterates `x - 1` times. The loop head does not include any other variables that can be directly adjusted within the context of the loop itself. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is the loop counter, which is represented by the range `(x - 1)`.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body (as indicated by the comment `# the loop body is omit`), we only need to ensure that the loop can continue to execute based on the range specified.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have completed one iteration, meaning that the range `(x - 1)` would have been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the range should reflect this decrement.

Given that the loop runs `x - 1` times, after one iteration, the remaining iterations would be `x - 2`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop will run `x - 2` more times.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree, the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed, `x` is at least 2, `y` is an integer, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory where `lst[a]` includes `b` as its last element, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, and `rev[b]` now includes `a` as its last element.**
