The function `bfs` performs a breadth-first search on a tree represented by an adjacency list to find the shortest path from a starting node to a target node. It returns the distance (number of edges) between the start and target nodes if a path exists, 0 if the start and target nodes are the same, and -1 if no path exists between them.
