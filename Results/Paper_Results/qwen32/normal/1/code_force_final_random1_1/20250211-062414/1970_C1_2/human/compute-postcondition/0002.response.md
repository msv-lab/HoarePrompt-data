The given code snippet initializes a new `defaultdict` named `rev` with `list` as its default factory. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, the edges represented by `u` and `v`, the initial node `u_1`, the integers `x` and `y`, or the existing `defaultdict` `lst`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**
