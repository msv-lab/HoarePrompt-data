The function determines the final resting position of a stone on a tree structure after it rolls from an initial node. Given a tree with exactly two leaves, the stone rolls down the tree following the edges until it reaches a leaf node. The function outputs "Hermione" if the stone ends up at one specific leaf and "Ron" if it ends up at the other leaf.
