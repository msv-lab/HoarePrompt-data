Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5; `t` is an integer equal to 1; the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed; `x` is an integer; `y` is an integer; `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node a to lists of nodes b, and `lst[tmp]` is now empty; `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node b to lists of nodes a; `z` is an input integer; `tmp` is the last node from which an element was popped; `one` is True if the number of iterations is even, or False if the number of iterations is odd; `two` is True`.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is the assignment of the boolean value `True` to the variable `two`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
