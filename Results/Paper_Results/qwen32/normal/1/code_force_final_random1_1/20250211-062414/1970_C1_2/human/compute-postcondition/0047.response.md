Postcondition: **Queue is not empty (possibly with one more element), visited set contains all reachable nodes from start (including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in the visited set initially), current is the first element of the tuple popped from the queue, dist is the second element of the tuple popped from the queue, and `tree[current]` must have at least one element. If `neighbor` was not in the visited set, it is now added to the visited set and the queue is updated with one more element.**
