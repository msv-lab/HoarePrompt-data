The given code snippet modifies the list associated with the key `tmp` in the `defaultdict` `lst` by popping its last element. This operation changes the list stored under `lst[tmp]` and updates the variable `tmp` to the value of the popped element.

Here's the detailed breakdown of the changes:

- `tmp` is initially the last element of `lst[z]` before it was popped.
- `tmp` is then updated to the last element of `lst[tmp]` before it was popped.
- After executing `tmp = lst[tmp].pop()`, the list `lst[tmp]` loses its last element, and `tmp` takes the value of that last element.

Given these points, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5; `t` is an integer equal to 1; the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v representing edges of the tree; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the initial node where the stone is placed; `x` is an integer; `y` is an integer; `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node a to lists of nodes b, and `lst[z]` contains at least one element except the last element which was popped; `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing x-1 mappings from node b to lists of nodes a; `z` is an input integer; `tmp` is now the last element of the list `lst[tmp]` before it was popped and has been updated to the last element of the list `lst[tmp]` before it was popped; `one` is False; `lst[tmp]` contains at least one element except the last element which was popped.**

In simpler terms, the list `lst[tmp]` has lost its last element, and `tmp` now holds the value of that last element. All other variables remain unchanged.
