Output State: **Queue is not empty (except it has one less element), visited set contains all reachable nodes from start including `neighbor`, current is the first element of the tuple popped from the queue, dist is the second element of the queue popped from the queue, `tree[current]` must have at least one element, and `neighbor` is not in the visited set anymore.**

Natural Language: After executing the code, the `visited` set now includes the `neighbor` node, which was previously not in the set. All other conditions remain the same: the queue still has one less element than before, `current` and `dist` retain their values from the tuple that was popped from the queue, and `tree[current]` still has at least one element.
