Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), an integer `t` which is always 1, a list of `n-1` pairs of integers `(u, v)` representing the edges of the tree, and a single integer `u_1` representing the initial node where a stone is placed. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. The function returns the node number where the stone will end up after rolling down the tree from the initial node `u_1`.**
