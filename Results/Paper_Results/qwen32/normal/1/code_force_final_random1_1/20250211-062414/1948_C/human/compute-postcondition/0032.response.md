To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

We know that `i` starts at 1 and increments by 2 each iteration until it reaches `n`. The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `t` remains unchanged (irrelevant to the loop head)
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` and `b` are strings input by the user
- `i` is 3

Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `5` (since `3 + 2 = 5`). The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are strings input by the user, `i` is 5**
