Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to `<` with `i + 1 < n`, or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both equal to `<`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain the same. The conditions regarding the characters in strings `a` and `b` are still valid. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
