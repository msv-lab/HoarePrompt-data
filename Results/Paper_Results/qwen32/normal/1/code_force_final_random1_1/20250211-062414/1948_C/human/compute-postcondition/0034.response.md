Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are strings input by the user, `i` is 5 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. It only causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
