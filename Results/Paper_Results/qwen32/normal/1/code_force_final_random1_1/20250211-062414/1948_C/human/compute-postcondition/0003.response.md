The code snippet `a = input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. This means that `a` will now hold the value of the input string. The other variables (`t` and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer (which is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'**.
