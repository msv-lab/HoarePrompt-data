Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a string of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'; `b` is a string. At the current index `i`, either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<' and `i + 1 < n`, or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<'. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that it exits the most internal loop or if statement.
