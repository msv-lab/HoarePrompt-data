In the given initial state, several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) are described, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Let's break it down:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `n` is an even integer between 2 and 400,000 inclusive.
- `a` is a string of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'.
- `b` is a string (its value is not specified).
- `i` is set to the integer value 5.

However, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. It directly prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
