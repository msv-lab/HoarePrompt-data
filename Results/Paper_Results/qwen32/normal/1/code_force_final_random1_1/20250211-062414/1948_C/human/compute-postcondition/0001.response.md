In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use inside the loop. The state before the loop starts includes `t`, `n`, and the two strings representing the rows of the grid.

However, according to the instructions, we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head only involves the variable `_` and `t`. Since `_` is just a placeholder and its value doesn't affect the loop's execution, the only variable we need to consider adjusting is `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. Given that the problem states `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, the condition for the loop to execute is already satisfied by the provided constraints. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself.

Thus, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute. Here is the final state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; each of the two strings representing the rows of the grid consists of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'**
