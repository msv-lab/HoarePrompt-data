Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains unchanged; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string input by the user; `b` is a string input by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
        print('No')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are strings input by the user. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to `<`, or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both equal to `<`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur regarding the control flow.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are strings input by the user, `i` is 3. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are strings input by the user, `i` is 5. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes occur to the control flow.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
