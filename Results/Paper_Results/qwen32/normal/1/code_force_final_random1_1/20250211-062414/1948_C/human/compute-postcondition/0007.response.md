Given the initial state, we have several variables and conditions described:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- `n` is an even integer within the range 2 to 2 Â· 10^5.
- `a` is a string of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'.
- `b` is a string.
- At any index `i`, either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<' with the condition `i + 1 < n`, or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<'.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. It directly prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **No**
