To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how it processes each test case.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b`, each of length `n`. The inner loop checks pairs of characters in the strings `a` and `b` starting from index 1 and incrementing by 2 (i.e., it checks indices 1, 3, 5, ..., up to `n-1`). If any pair of characters violates the condition (either `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'`), it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop. If no violations are found, it prints "Yes".

Given the output states after the first three iterations:
- After the first iteration, the loop printed "Yes".
- After the second iteration, the loop again printed "Yes".
- After the third iteration, the loop also printed "Yes".

This indicates that for the first three test cases, no violations were found, and thus "Yes" was printed for each.

Since the loop runs `t` times, and we have the output for the first three iterations, we can infer that for the remaining `t-3` iterations, the same logic applies. If no violations are found in those iterations, "Yes" will be printed for each of them as well.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop will be a series of "Yes" outputs corresponding to each of the `t` test cases.

Output State: **The loop will print "Yes" for each of the t test cases.**
