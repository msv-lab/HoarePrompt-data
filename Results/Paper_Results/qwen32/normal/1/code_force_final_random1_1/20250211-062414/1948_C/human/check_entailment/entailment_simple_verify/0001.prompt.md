You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The robot starts at position (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n) by moving according to the rules:
1. It can move left, right, up, or down.
2. After moving, it must follow the direction of the arrow in the cell it lands in.

The key observation here is that the robot must eventually cross from the first row to the second row and reach the last column. To achieve this, the robot must find a path that allows it to switch rows at some point and then move right until it reaches the last column.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution iterates through the columns of the grid, checking pairs of columns (i, i+1) for certain conditions involving the arrows. Specifically, it checks if there are two consecutive columns where both arrows point left (`<`) in such a way that it would trap the robot, preventing it from reaching (2, n).

However, the logic in the provided code is not sufficient to fully determine if the robot can reach (2, n). Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incomplete Check for Trapping**: The code only checks for specific patterns of arrows that might trap the robot, but it does not consider all possible scenarios that could prevent the robot from reaching the goal.
   
2. **Ignoring Other Movement Options**: The robot can move up or down at any point, which the code does not account for. For example, if there is a sequence of arrows that allows the robot to switch rows and then move right, the code might incorrectly conclude that the robot cannot reach the goal.

3. **Not Considering All Paths**: The code only checks a limited set of conditions and does not explore all possible paths the robot could take.

### Example Counter-Case

Consider the following test case:
```
2
4
><>>
><>>
```

For this input, the robot can start at (1, 1), move right to (1, 2), follow the arrow to (2, 2), move right to (2, 3), and finally follow the arrow to (2, 4). However, the provided code would likely output "NO" because it does not correctly handle this scenario.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly determine if the robot can reach (2, n) for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
