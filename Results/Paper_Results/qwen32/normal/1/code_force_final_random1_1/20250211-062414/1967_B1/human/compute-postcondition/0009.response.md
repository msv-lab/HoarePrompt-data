Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2)`, and `g` is less than `countmins`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
