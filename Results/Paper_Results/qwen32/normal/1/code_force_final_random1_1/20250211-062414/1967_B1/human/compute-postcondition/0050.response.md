The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`. Given the initial state, `g` is initially `int(n / 2)` and `countmins` is 1. After executing `g -= countmins`, `g` becomes `int(n / 2) - 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` and `m` are the input integers where `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`; `i` is 0; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
