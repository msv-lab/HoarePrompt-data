### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements and the function summary.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`. It then iterates while `count` is less than or equal to `m` and performs some calculations involving `g` and `countmins`. Finally, it prints `ans`.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program logic:
1. Initialize `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`.
2. While `count` is less than or equal to `m`:
   - Set `countmins` to `count - 1`.
   - Compute `g` as the integer division of `n` by `count`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, break out of the loop.
   - Subtract `countmins` from `g`.
   - Add the integer division of `g` by `count` plus 1 to `ans`.
   - Increment `count` by 1.
3. Print `ans`.

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **GCD Calculation**: The program does not explicitly compute the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\). Instead, it uses `g` which is computed as `n // count`, and this does not directly relate to the gcd condition.
2. **Logic Mismatch**: The logic used to compute `ans` does not align with the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. **Incorrect Counting**: The program seems to be counting something related to multiples but does not correctly account for the gcd condition.

#### Counterexample:
Let's take the example provided in the problem statement:
```
1
2 3
```
Expected Output: `3` (Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\))

Actual Output of Provided Code: Incorrect

#### Verification Using Function Summary:
The function summary states that the function processes multiple test cases and calculates a value `ans` based on the given logic. However, the logic described in the summary does not match the problem's requirement of checking the gcd condition.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis and the counterexample, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used in the program does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
