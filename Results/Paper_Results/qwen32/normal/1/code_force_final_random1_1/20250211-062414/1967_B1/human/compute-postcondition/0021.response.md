The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` was 2, so now `count` is 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 2, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + int(g / 3) + 1 + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`.**
