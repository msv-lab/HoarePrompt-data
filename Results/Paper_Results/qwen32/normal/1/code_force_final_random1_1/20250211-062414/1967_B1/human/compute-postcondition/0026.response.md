Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `count` is 3, `countmins` is 2, and `g` is `int(n / 3)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without modification to the variables.**
