The value of `g` is decreased by the value of `countmins`. Given that `g` was initially `n // 2` and `countmins` is 1, `g` now becomes `n // 2 - 1`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` and `m` are the input integers where `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n`; `i` is 1; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n // 2 - 1`.**
