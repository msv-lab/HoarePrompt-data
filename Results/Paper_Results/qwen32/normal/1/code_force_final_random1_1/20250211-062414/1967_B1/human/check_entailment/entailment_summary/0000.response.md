### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\),
- \(1 \le b \le m\),
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution attempts to solve this problem using an iterative approach. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `count` is initialized to 2.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`, which means it starts counting from the number of pairs where \(b = 1\).

2. **Iterative Adjustment**:
   - The loop runs while `count` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - For each `count` (which represents the current value of \(b\)):
     - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
     - `g` is calculated as `int(n / count)`, which gives the maximum possible value of `a` divided by `b`.
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks because further values of `b` won't satisfy the condition.
     - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
     - `ans` is incremented by `int(g / count) + 1`, which seems to be an attempt to count the valid pairs for the current `b`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all possible values of `b` up to `m`, the result `ans` is printed for each test case.

#### Issues with the Provided Solution:
- **Logic Error**: The core logic for counting valid pairs does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- **Incorrect Counting**: The formula used to calculate `ans` does not accurately reflect the number of valid pairs. It appears to be an oversimplified or incorrect interpretation of the problem requirements.
- **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases properly, especially when `b` is greater than 1.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds true. This can be done using nested loops, but optimizations might be necessary due to the constraints.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided solution does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
