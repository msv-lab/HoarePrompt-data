The value of `g` is assigned the integer division of `n` by `count`. Given that `count` is 2, `g` will be the integer part of `n / 2`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2)`**.
