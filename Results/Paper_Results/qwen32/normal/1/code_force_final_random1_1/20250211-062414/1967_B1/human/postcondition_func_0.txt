The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value `ans` based on the given logic. The value `ans` is derived by iteratively adjusting `n` and `m` according to the rules defined within the function until a certain condition is met.
