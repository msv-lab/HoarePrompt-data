Let's analyze the given program and compare it against the problem statement to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`. It then enters a loop that continues as long as `count` is less than or equal to `m`.

Inside the loop:
- It calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`.
- It calculates `g` as the integer division of `n` by `count`.
- If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
- Otherwise, it adjusts `g` by subtracting `countmins` from it.
- It increments `ans` by the integer division of `g` by `count` plus 1.
- It increments `count` by 1.

Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Verification Against Problem Statement:
The provided program seems to be attempting to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) but the logic inside the loop does not directly match the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement for clarity:
- For the test case (10, 8), the valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2). There are 14 such pairs.

However, the provided program's logic does not seem to correctly identify these pairs. Specifically, the program's logic appears to be counting something else, possibly related to multiples of `count` within `n`, but it doesn't align with the problem's requirement involving the gcd condition.

### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch between the program's logic and the problem's requirements, we can conclude that the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
