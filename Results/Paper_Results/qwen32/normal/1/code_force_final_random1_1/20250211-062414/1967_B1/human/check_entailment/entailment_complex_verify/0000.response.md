### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using the following steps:
1. Initialize `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`.
2. Iterate while `count` is less than or equal to `m`:
   - Calculate `countmins` as `count - 1`.
   - Compute `g` as the integer division of `n` by `count`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, break out of the loop.
   - Subtract `countmins` from `g`.
   - Add the integer division of `g` by `count` plus 1 to `ans`.
   - Increment `count` by 1.
3. Print the final value of `ans`.

#### Key Points:
- The program does not explicitly compute the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\).
- The logic used to compute `ans` does not directly relate to checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Counterexample:
Let's verify the correctness using the provided counterexample:
- **Test Case**: `1 2 3`
- **Expected Output**: `3`
  - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\)
- **Actual Output of Provided Code**: Incorrect

#### Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:
- **Initialization**: `count = 2`, `ans = n`
- **First Iteration (`count = 2`)**:
  - `countmins = 1`
  - `g = n // 2`
  - If `g < 1`, break.
  - Otherwise, `g -= 1`
  - `ans += (g // 2) + 1`
  - `count += 1`
- **Second Iteration (`count = 3`)**:
  - `countmins = 2`
  - `g = n // 3`
  - If `g < 2`, break.
  - Otherwise, `g -= 2`
  - `ans += (g // 3) + 1`
  - `count += 1`

The provided logic does not correctly reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The program seems to be attempting a different approach that does not match the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The logic used to compute `ans` does not align with the condition specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
