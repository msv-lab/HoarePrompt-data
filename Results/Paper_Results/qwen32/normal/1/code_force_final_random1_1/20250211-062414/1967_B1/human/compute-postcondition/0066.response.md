The code snippet `ans = n` assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. This means the previous value of `ans` (which was `n + sum of contributions from each iteration where `g >= countmins`) is overwritten by just `n`.

Other variables (`t`, `m`, `count`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` and `m` are the input integers; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n`; `i` is 1.**
