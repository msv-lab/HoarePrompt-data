The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`. Given that `g` was initially set to `int(n / count)` and `countmins` is 1, `g` is now `int(n / count) - 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, `i`, `countmins`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` and `m` are the input integers where `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is equal to `n`; `i` is 0; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `int(n / count) - 1`.**
