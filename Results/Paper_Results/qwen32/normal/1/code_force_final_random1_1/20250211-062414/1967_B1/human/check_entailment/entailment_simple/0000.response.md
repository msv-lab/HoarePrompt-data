### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

This means that there exists an integer \(k\) such that:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

Let's denote \(\gcd(a, b) = d\). Then we can write:
\[ a = dx \]
\[ b = dy \]
where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). Substituting these into the condition, we get:
\[ dx + dy = k \cdot dy \cdot d \]
\[ dx + dy = k \cdot d^2 y \]
\[ x + y = k \cdot d y \]
\[ x = (k \cdot d - 1) \cdot y \]

This implies that \(x\) must be a multiple of \(y\), but since \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), the only possibility is \(x = k \cdot d - 1\) and \(k = 1\). Therefore, we have:
\[ x = d - 1 \]
\[ a = d(d - 1) \]
\[ b = d \]

Thus, for each \(d\) from 1 to \(\min(n, m)\), we need to check if \(d(d - 1) \leq n\) and \(d \leq m\).

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve this problem using a different approach. Let's break down the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
```

- `ans = n` initializes the answer with the number of pairs where \(b = 1\).
- The loop starts with `count = 2` and goes up to `m`.
- For each `count`, it calculates how many valid `a` values exist for the current `b = count`.

However, the logic inside the loop does not correctly reflect the derived mathematical condition. Specifically, the calculation `g = int(n / count)` and subsequent adjustments do not accurately count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the derived condition \(a = d(d - 1)\) and \(b = d\).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution based on the derived mathematical condition. It seems to follow a different logic that does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
