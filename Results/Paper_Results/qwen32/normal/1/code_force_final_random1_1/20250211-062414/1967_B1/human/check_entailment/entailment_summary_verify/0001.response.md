### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem requirements and the function summary.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through possible values of \(b\) and calculating the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\). Here is the breakdown of the program logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n  # Incorrect initialization
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Initialization of `ans`:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that we need to count all valid pairs starting from zero.

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - The program uses a loop to iterate over possible values of `b` (starting from 2) and calculates the number of valid `a` for each `b`.
   - The calculation `g = int(n / count)` and subsequent adjustments do not correctly reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The condition `if g < countmins` and the subsequent logic do not accurately determine the number of valid pairs.

3. **Handling of \(b = 1\):**
   - The program starts the loop from `count = 2`, thus missing the case when \(b = 1\). When \(b = 1\), every \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) is a valid pair because \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\).

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Initialize `ans` to 0.
2. Iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
3. For each \(b\), iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the valid pairs and print the result for each test case.

#### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
