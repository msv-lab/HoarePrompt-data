Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `m` must be at least 3, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + int(g / 3) + 1 + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `int(n / 3)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
