Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. It processes each test case and returns a result for each `n`. Specifically, if `n` is within the range 1 to 2 Â· 10^5 for each test case, the function performs some operation (not detailed here) and returns a corresponding result for each `n`.**
