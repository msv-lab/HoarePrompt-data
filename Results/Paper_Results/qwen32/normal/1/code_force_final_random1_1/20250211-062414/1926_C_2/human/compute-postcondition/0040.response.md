Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t - (t-1) â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to 200000.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will have been decremented to 0, meaning the loop has executed exactly `t` times. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last input integer provided during the loop's final iteration. The variables `N` and `pd` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
