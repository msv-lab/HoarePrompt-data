To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop works. The loop iterates over each digit of the integer `i` (which starts as `n + 2`) and adds the integer value of each digit to `pd[i]`.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
   - `N` is 200001.
   - `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to `n` except `pd[n + 2]` which is initially `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1]`.
   - `i` is initialized to `n + 2`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each digit `j` in the string representation of `i`, the loop adds `int(j)` to `pd[i]`.

Since `i` is `n + 2`, the loop will iterate over each digit of `n + 2`. Let's denote the digits of `n + 2` as `d_k, d_{k-1}, ..., d_1, d_0` where `d_k` is the most significant digit and `d_0` is the least significant digit. The loop will add each of these digits to `pd[n + 2]`.

Therefore, after the loop completes, `pd[n + 2]` will be updated to:
\[ pd[n + 2] = pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1] + \sum_{m=0}^{k} d_m \]
where \( \sum_{m=0}^{k} d_m \) is the sum of the digits of `n + 2`.

### Final Output State
The final state of the variables will be:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `N` remains unchanged.
- `pd` will have `pd[n + 2]` updated to include the sum of the digits of `n + 2`.
- `i` remains `n + 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to `n` except `pd[n + 2]` which is now `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1] + sum_of_digits(n + 2)`, `i` is `n + 2`.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is that `pd[n + 2]` will have been incremented by the sum of the digits of `n + 2`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
