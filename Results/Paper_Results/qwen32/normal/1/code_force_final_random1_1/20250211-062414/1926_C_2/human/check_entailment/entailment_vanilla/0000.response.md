Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Precomputation**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` set to 0.
   - It then iterates over all integers from 1 to 200,000.
   - For each integer `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits using the function `func_1`.
   - It adds this digit sum to the cumulative `sum`.
   - It appends the current value of `sum` to the list `A`.

2. **Handling Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
   - It prints the value at index `n-1` of the precomputed list `A`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an integer `num` and returns the sum of its digits.
   - It does this by repeatedly taking the last digit of `num` (using `num % 10`), adding it to `a`, and then removing the last digit from `num` (using integer division by 10).

### Evaluation

- **Precomputation**:
  - The program precomputes the cumulative sum of digit sums for all integers from 1 to 200,000.
  - This means `A[i]` will contain the sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `i+1`.
  - This precomputation is done outside any input handling, which means it will be executed once before any test cases are processed.

- **Handling Input**:
  - For each test case, the program simply looks up the precomputed result in `A[n-1]`.
  - This lookup is very fast (O(1) time complexity), which is necessary given the constraints (up to 10,000 test cases).

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - This function correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given integer.
  - It uses a simple loop that runs in O(d) time, where d is the number of digits in the number.

### Conclusion

- The program efficiently precomputes the required values and handles each test case in constant time.
- Given the constraints, this approach is both correct and efficient.
- The program should produce the correct output for all valid inputs within the given time limits.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
