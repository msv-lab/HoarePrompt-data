The code divides `num` by 10 and assigns the integer part of the result back to `num`. This effectively removes the last digit of `num`. Since `a` was initially the last digit of `num`, after the operation, `a` remains unchanged, but `num` is now the integer formed by removing its last digit.

Given the initial state, `num` was an integer between 1 and 2 · 10^5, and `a` was the last digit of `num`.

After executing the code, `num` is now an integer with the last digit removed, and `a` retains its original value.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `num` < 2 · 10^5 (with the last digit removed), `a` is the last digit of the original `num`.**
