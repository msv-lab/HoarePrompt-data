The code snippet provided is `pd[i] += int(j)`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, which means `pd[2]` will be updated. Since `pd[2]` was already increased by `int(j)` once as per the initial state, adding `int(j)` again will further increase `pd[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where the first `t` elements are the cumulative sums of the digits of their respective indices up to `i`, with `pd[1]` increased by `int(j)` and `pd[2]` increased by `2 * int(j)`, `i` is 2.**
