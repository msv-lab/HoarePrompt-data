To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is just `j`. The loop iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation of `i`.

Given:
- `i` is `n + 2`
- `j` is the next digit in the string representation of `i`

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been the last digit of the string representation of `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be the next digit in the string representation of `i`.

Let's break it down:

1. Convert `i` to its string representation.
2. Identify the current `j` as the last digit processed.
3. Determine if there are more digits left in the string representation of `i`.

Since `i` is `n + 2`, let's denote the string representation of `i` as `str_i`. The variable `j` would be the next digit in `str_i` that hasn't been processed yet.

If `j` was the last digit processed in the previous iteration, then `j` should now be the next digit in `str_i`. If there are no more digits left, the loop will terminate.

However, since the task specifies that we need to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we assume there is at least one more digit to process.

Let's assume `str_i` has more than one digit. After processing the last digit, `j` should now be the next digit in `str_i`.

### Example Calculation:
If `i` is `n + 2` and `n` is some integer, let's say `n = 5`, then `i` would be `7`. The string representation of `7` is `"7"`. If `j` was the last digit processed, there are no more digits left, and the loop would terminate. But if we assume `i` is a larger number, like `123`, then `str_i` is `"123"`. If `j` was `'1'` in the previous iteration, then `j` should now be `'2'`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to `n` except `pd[n + 2]` which is now `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1] + 2 * int(j)`, `i` is `n + 2`, `j` is the next digit in the string representation of `i`**

Since `j` was the last digit processed, `j` should now be the next digit in the string representation of `i`. If `i` is `n + 2` and `j` was the last digit, then `j` should be the next digit in `str(n + 2)`.

For example, if `n` is `5`, then `i` is `7`, and `str_i` is `"7"`. If `j` was `'7'`, there are no more digits. If `n` is `121`, then `i` is `123`, and `str_i` is `"123"`. If `j` was `'1'`, then `j` should now be `'2'`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration, assuming there is a next digit, would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to `n` except `pd[n + 2]` which is now `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1] + 2 * int(j)`, `i` is `n + 2`, `j` is the next digit in the string representation of `i`**

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` or the exact digits, we can generalize:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for `i` from 1 to `n` except `pd[n + 2]` which is now `pd[n + 2] + pd[n + 1] + 2 * int(j)`, `i` is `n + 2`, `j` is the next digit in the string representation of `i`**
