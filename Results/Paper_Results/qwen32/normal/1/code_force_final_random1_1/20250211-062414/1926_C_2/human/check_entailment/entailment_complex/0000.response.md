### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by precomputing the cumulative sum of the digit sums for numbers from 1 to 200,000 and storing these cumulative sums in an array `A`. For each test case, it simply retrieves the precomputed result from this array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Precomputation**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` to 0.
   - It iterates over each number `i` from 1 to 200,000.
   - For each number `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits using the `func_1` function.
   - It adds this digit sum to `sum` and appends the current value of `sum` to the list `A`.
   
2. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
   - It prints the value at index `n-1` of the precomputed list `A`.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Precomputation**:
  - The `func_1` function correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number.
  - The cumulative sum of these digit sums is stored in the list `A`, which allows for quick lookup later.

- **Test Case Handling**:
  - Since the list `A` is precomputed up to 200,000, any valid input `n` within the range 1 to 200,000 can be handled efficiently by simply indexing into `A`.
  - The program uses `A[n - 1]` to get the correct cumulative sum for the first `n` numbers, which matches the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem constraints and the provided code, the program is both correct and efficient. It precomputes the necessary values and handles each test case in constant time, ensuring it meets the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
