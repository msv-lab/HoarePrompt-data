### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify whether the generated sequence `a` for each test case meets the specified conditions:

1. **No Subsequence Sums to `k`:** The sequence `a` must not have any subsequence whose sum equals `k`.
2. **Subsequences Sum to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`:** For every integer `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`), there must exist a subsequence of `a` whose sum equals `v`.

Let's analyze the logic of `func_14` to see if it satisfies these conditions:

#### Case 1: \( k = 1 \)

- When \( k = 1 \), the function handles two sub-cases:
  - If \( n = 2 \), it returns `[1, 2]`. This sequence satisfies the conditions because:
    - No subsequence sums to 1.
    - The subsequences `[1]` and `[2]` sum to 1 and 2 respectively, but since 1 is excluded, only 2 is required, and it is present.
  - For \( n > 2 \), the function returns `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`. This ensures that:
    - No subsequence sums to 1.
    - All sums from 2 to \( n \) can be formed using the powers of 2 and the additional numbers 2 and 3.

#### Case 2: \( k \neq 1 \)

- For \( k \neq 1 \), the function constructs the sequence as follows:
  - It starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
  - It appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence.
  - It continues appending powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
  
This construction ensures that:
- No subsequence sums to `k` because the specific values `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` are strategically chosen to avoid forming `k` through any combination of subsequences.
- All sums from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed using the powers of 2 and the additional numbers.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_14` appears to correctly generate sequences that satisfy the problem's requirements for both cases \( k = 1 \) and \( k \neq 1 \).

### Conclusion:

Since `func_14` correctly handles both cases and `func_15` properly processes multiple test cases, the entire program is correct.

**Correctness:** **True**
