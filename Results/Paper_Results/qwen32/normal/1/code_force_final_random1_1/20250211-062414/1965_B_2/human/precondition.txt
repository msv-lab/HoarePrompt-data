d is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the parameters for each test case. The length of d (number of test cases) is between 1 and 1000, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7. processing, da, and rank are additional parameters that are not specified in the problem description and their roles are unclear based on the given information.
