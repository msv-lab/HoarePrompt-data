The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable, and the range is determined by the return value of `func_10()`. According to the problem statement, `func_10()` returns 1, meaning the loop will run exactly once because `range(1)` generates a sequence with a single element (0).

Since `func_10()` always returns 1, the loop will not execute more than once. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any state for the loop to execute another iteration because the loop will terminate after the first iteration.

However, if we were to strictly follow the instruction to adjust the state at the start of the next iteration assuming the loop could potentially run more times (which it cannot given the current implementation), we would consider the following:

- The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted since it is a throwaway variable and its value does not affect the loop's continuation.
- The return value of `func_10()` does not change, so the range remains `range(1)`.

Given this, the state at the start of the "next" iteration (which doesn't exist in this case) would be the same as the end of the previous iteration, except that the loop would not actually start again.

State: **The value returned by `func_14()` is written to the standard output as a string followed by a newline. `func_10()` returns 1.**
