Based on the provided information, we know that `func_10()` returns 1, meaning the loop will only iterate once. Therefore, the loop will not execute more than 3 times because the condition for the loop is based on `func_10()` which is 1. Since the loop only runs once, the output state after all the executions of the loop (which is just one iteration) is the same as the output state after the first iteration.

Output State: **The value returned by `func_14()` is written to the standard output as a string followed by a newline.**

In natural language, this means that the function `func_14()` is called once, and whatever value it returns is printed to the console as a string with a newline character following it.
