To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop behaves and how many times it will run based on the given conditions.

### Analysis:
- The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = l - 1`, where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
- For the loop to execute at least 3 times, `l` must be at least 5 (since `i` starts at 2 and goes up to `l-1`).
- Given that `ans` starts as `[2, 3]`, and each iteration appends `2 ** i` to `ans`, we can deduce that the final `ans` list will contain `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2 starting from `2^2` up to `2^(l-1)`.

### Calculation:
Let's assume `n` is such that its binary representation has a length `l`. The loop will append `2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^(l-1)` to `ans`.

### Example:
If `n` is 16 (binary `10000`), then `l` is 5. The loop will run for `i = 2` to `i = 4`, appending `2^2, 2^3, 2^4` to `ans`.

Thus, `ans` will be `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16]`.

### General Case:
For any `n` with binary length `l`, the final `ans` will be `[2, 3] + [2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^(l-1)]`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state will depend on the specific value of `n`, but the structure of `ans` will always follow the pattern described above.

### Final Output State:
Assuming `n` is such that its binary representation length `l` is 5 (as per the example with `n = 16`):

Output State: **[2, 3, 4, 8, 16]**

This means that if `n` is chosen such that its binary representation has a length of 5, the final state of `ans` after the loop completes will be `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16]`. If `n` has a different binary length, the final `ans` will include additional powers of 2 accordingly.
