To thoroughly evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and implementation of `func_14()` in detail, as it is responsible for constructing the sequence `a` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_14()`

#### Case 1: \( k = 1 \)
- **Subcase 1.1**: \( n = 2 \)
  - The function returns `[2]`.
  - **Verification**:
    - No subsequence sums to 1.
    - The only possible subsequence is `[2]`, which sums to 2.
    - This satisfies the condition since \( v = 1 \) is excluded and \( v = 2 \) is included.
- **Subcase 1.2**: \( n > 2 \)
  - The function initializes `ans` with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
  - **Verification**:
    - Powers of 2 can form any sum from 1 to \( 2^l - 1 \) where \( l \) is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
    - The value `3` ensures that the sum 1 can be formed (using `[2, 1]` where 1 is derived from the binary representation).
    - The sum 2 is already covered by `[2]`.
    - The sum 3 is explicitly included.
    - The sum 4 is covered by `[4]`.
    - The sum 5 is covered by `[4, 1]`.
    - And so on...
    - The sum \( k = 1 \) is explicitly excluded.
  
#### Case 2: \( k \neq 1 \)
- The function initializes `ans` with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus one.
- It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to `ans` to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.
- It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to `ans`.
- It appends additional powers of 2 to cover the remaining bits of `n`.

- **Verification**:
  - **No Subsequence Sums to `k`**:
    - The term `k - 1 - sum(ans)` ensures that the exact sum `k` cannot be formed because it introduces a gap that prevents the sum `k` from being achievable.
  - **Subsequences Sum to All Values Except `k`**:
    - Powers of 2 can form any sum from 1 to \( 2^l - 1 \) where \( l \) is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
    - The additional terms `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` help in forming sums that include these values.
    - The sum `k` is explicitly excluded due to the term `k - 1 - sum(ans)`.

### Testing the Implementation
Let's consider the example test cases provided in the problem description:

1. **Test Case**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 2 \)
   - Output: `1\n1`
   - **Verification**:
     - No subsequence sums to 2.
     - The only possible subsequence is `[1]`, which sums to 1.
     - This satisfies the condition since \( v = 2 \) is excluded and \( v = 1 \) is included.

2. **Test Case**: \( n = 6 \), \( k = 1 \)
   - Output: `5\n2 3 4 5 6`
   - **Verification**:
     - No subsequence sums to 1.
     - The sums 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 can be formed using subsequences of `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
     - This satisfies the condition since \( v = 1 \) is excluded and all other sums are included.

3. **Test Case**: \( n = 8 \), \( k = 8 \)
   - Output: `7\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - **Verification**:
     - No subsequence sums to 8.
     - The sums 1 through 7 can be formed using subsequences of `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
     - This satisfies the condition since \( v = 8 \) is excluded and all other sums are included.

4. **Test Case**: \( n = 9 \), \( k = 3 \)
   - Output: `4\n7 1 4 1`
   - **Verification**:
     - No subsequence sums to 3.
     - The sums 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 can be formed using subsequences of `[7, 1, 4, 1]`.
     - This satisfies the condition since \( v = 3 \) is excluded and all other sums are included.

5. **Test Case**: \( n = 10 \), \( k = 7 \)
   - Output: `4\n1 2 8 3`
   - **Verification**:
     - No subsequence sums to 7.
     - The sums 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 can be formed using subsequences of `[1, 2, 8, 3]`.
     - This satisfies the condition since \( v = 7 \) is excluded and all other sums are included.

### Conclusion
Based on the detailed analysis and verification of the test cases, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles both special and general cases appropriately and ensures that the constructed sequence meets the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: True**
