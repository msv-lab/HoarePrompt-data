Precondition: **This function does not have any parameters in its signature, so there are no variables to describe. However, it implies that it relies on other functions (`func_10` and `func_14`) which are not provided here. Based on the context, `func_10` likely returns the number of test cases, and `func_14` computes and returns the result for each test case.**
