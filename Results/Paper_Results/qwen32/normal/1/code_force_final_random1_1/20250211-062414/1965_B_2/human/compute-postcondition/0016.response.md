The code snippet assigns the binary representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix) to the variable `bk`. This means `bk` now holds the binary form of `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`.
- `k` is not equal to 1.
- `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
- `l` is the length of `b`.

After executing the code `bk = bin(k)[2:]`:
- `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.

No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`; `k` is not equal to 1; `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of `b`; `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**
