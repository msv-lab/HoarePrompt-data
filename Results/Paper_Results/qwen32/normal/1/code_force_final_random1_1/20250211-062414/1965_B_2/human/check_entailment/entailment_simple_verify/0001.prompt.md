You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Recap
We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. It then constructs a sequence `a` for each test case according to the rules specified in the problem statement.

#### Key Functions
- `func_7()`: Reads a line of input and returns a list of integers.
- `func_10()`: Reads a single integer from input.
- `func_14()`: Constructs the sequence `a` for a given `n` and `k`.
- `func_15()`: Handles multiple test cases by calling `func_14()` for each one.

#### Sequence Construction Logic (`func_14()`)
1. **Binary Representation**: The function converts `n` and `k` into their binary representations.
2. **Case when `k == 1`**:
   - If `n == 2`, it returns `[2]`.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `ans` with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 until the length of the binary representation of `n` is reached.
3. **General Case (`k != 1`)**:
   - Initializes `ans` with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus one.
   - Appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to `ans` to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - Appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to `ans`.
   - Appends additional powers of 2 to cover the remaining bits of `n`.

### Verification
To verify the correctness of the program, we need to check if the constructed sequence satisfies both conditions for every possible `n` and `k` within the given constraints.

1. **No Subsequence Sums to `k`**:
   - The logic ensures that specific values are added to prevent the sum `k` from being achieved. For example, `k - 1 - sum(ans)` ensures that the exact sum `k` cannot be formed.
   
2. **Subsequences Sum to All Values Except `k`**:
   - The inclusion of powers of 2 and carefully chosen additional values ensures that all sums from `1` to `n` except `k` can be formed using subsequences of `a`.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the special case when `k == 1` separately and uses a combination of powers of 2 and carefully chosen additional values to meet the requirements for general cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
