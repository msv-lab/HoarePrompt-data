The code multiplies `tem` by `arr[i]`. Given the initial state, `tem` is initially `arr[1]` and `i` is `0`. Therefore, `tem` is updated to `arr[1] * arr[0]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is a list containing `arr[1]`, `tem` is `arr[1] * arr[0]`, `i` is `0`**.
