The code appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Since `i` is `x`, the list `p` will now contain two elements: the initial `0` and the value of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x]`; `c` is a list containing a single element `[0]`; `i` is `x`; `j` is 1 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains 0.**
