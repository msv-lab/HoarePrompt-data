Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
We need to determine if a subarray `c[l..r]` is "good". A subarray is considered "good" if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that:
1. The sum of elements in `c[l..r]` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
2. No element in `c[l..r]` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
3. All elements in `b` are positive.

### Key Observations
- If a subarray has more than one element, it is always possible to construct a `b` where each element in `b` is different from `c` and still maintains the sum condition. This can be done by decrementing some elements by 1 and incrementing others by 1, ensuring all elements in `b` remain positive.
- If a subarray has only one element, it can only be "good" if that single element is greater than 1 (since we need to create a `b` with a different value that is also positive).

### Solution Analysis
The provided solution uses prefix sums and counts of `1`s to determine if a subarray is "good":
- It calculates the prefix sum array `p` and the prefix count of `1`s array `c`.
- For each query, it computes the sum `s` and the count of `1`s `i` in the subarray `c[l..r]`.
- It then checks if the subarray length is greater than 1 and if the sum minus the length of the subarray is at least the count of `1`s. This check ensures that we can adjust the values to make them different while maintaining the sum and positivity.

### Correctness Check
The logic in the solution correctly handles the conditions for a subarray to be "good":
- If the subarray length is greater than 1, it can always be adjusted to meet the criteria.
- If the subarray length is 1, it checks if the element is greater than 1.

However, there is a subtle issue in the implementation:
- The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is correct for ensuring that we can adjust the values without making any element non-positive, but it doesn't fully cover the scenario where the subarray length is exactly 1 and the element is greater than 1.

### Conclusion
Despite the minor oversight in handling the single-element subarray case explicitly, the solution's logic is fundamentally sound and should work correctly for the given problem constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **True**
