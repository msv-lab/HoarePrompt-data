The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which iterates over the elements in the list `l`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `x` changes.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` ≥ 0
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element
- `p` is `[0, i]`
- `c` is `[0, j]`
- `i` is `x`
- `j` is 1 if `x` equals 1; otherwise, `j` is 0

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` took the value of the current element in the list `l`. For the next iteration, `x` will take the value of the next element in the list `l`.

Let's denote the current position of `x` in the list `l` as `k`. After the previous iteration, `x` was `l[k]`. In the next iteration, `x` will be `l[k+1]`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k` or the specific elements in `l`, we can only say that `x` will be the next element in the list `l`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `t` remains the same
- `n` remains the same
- `m` remains the same
- `l` remains the same
- `p` remains the same (it is not affected by the loop variable `x`)
- `c` remains the same (it is not affected by the loop variable `x`)
- `i` will be updated to `x` (the next element in the list `l`)
- `j` will be updated based on the new value of `x`: `j` is 1 if `x` equals 1; otherwise, `j` is 0

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` ≥ 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i]`, `c` is `[0, j]`, `i` is the next element in the list `l`, `j` is 1 if the next element in the list `l` equals 1; otherwise, `j` is 0**
