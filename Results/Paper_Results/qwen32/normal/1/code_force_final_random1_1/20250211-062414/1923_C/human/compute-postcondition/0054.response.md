The code snippet provided is:

```python
c = [0]
```

This line reassigns the variable `c` to a new list containing only the integer `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing `[0]`, `c` is a list containing `[0]`, `i` and `j` are integers that represent the final count of `1`s in the last processed sublist and the total count of `1`s in the original `l` respectively after the last iteration.**
