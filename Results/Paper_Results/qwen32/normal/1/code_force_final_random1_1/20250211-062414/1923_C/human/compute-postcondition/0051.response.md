The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The initial state indicates that `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, and `j` have specific values or conditions. However, the code only affects `n` and `m`.

Since the code does not modify any other variables and simply updates `n` and `m` with new values from the input, the output state will reflect these changes while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is a list containing `[0]` followed by the cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in `l`, `i` and `j` are integers that represent the final count of `1`s in the last processed sublist and the total count of `1`s in `l` respectively after the last iteration. The loop has executed `m + 1` times.**
