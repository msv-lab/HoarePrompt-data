The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means the values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the input provided. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m-1` are integers read from the input with `m-1` greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is a list containing `[0]` followed by the cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the additional condition holds. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.**
