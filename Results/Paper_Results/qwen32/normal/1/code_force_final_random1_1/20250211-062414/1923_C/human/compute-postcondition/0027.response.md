The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This operation does not affect the previously defined variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, and `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is a list containing `[0]` followed by the cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in `l`, `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
