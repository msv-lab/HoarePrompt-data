The code snippet provided initializes two variables, `i` and `j`, both to `0`. This means that the final count of `1`s in the last processed sublist (`i`) and the total count of `1`s in the original list `l` (`j`) are reset to `0`.

Given the initial state, the only changes are to the variables `i` and `j`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`) retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing `[0]`, `c` is a list containing `[0]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0.**
