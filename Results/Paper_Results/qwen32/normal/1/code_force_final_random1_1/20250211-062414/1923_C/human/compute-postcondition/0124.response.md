The code appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`. No other variables are modified.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `c` now includes an additional element which is the current value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input; `m` is the second integer read from the input; `l` is a non-empty list of integers; `p` is `[0, i, i, i]`; `c` is `[0, j, j, j]`; `i` is `i + 2*x + x`; `j` is incremented by 1 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `a` and `b` are the most recent integers read from the input; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
