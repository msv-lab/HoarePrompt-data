Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing `[0]`, `c` is a list containing `[0]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `x` equals 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `j` has been incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
