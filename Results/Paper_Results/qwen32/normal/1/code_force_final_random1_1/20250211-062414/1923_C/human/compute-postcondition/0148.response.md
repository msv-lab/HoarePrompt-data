Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is 0 (since `m` is decremented by 1 in both the if and else parts), `l` is the list of integers read from the input, `p` is `[0] + [cumulative sums of elements in l]`, `c` is `[0] + [cumulative counts of 1s in l]`, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) ≥ i`, the condition holds as specified in the if part. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 ≤ 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.**
