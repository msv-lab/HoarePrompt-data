The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` is initially set to 2 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` is 1. After the increment, if `j` was initially 1, it becomes 2, and if `j` was initially 2, it becomes 3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x, 2 * x]`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j, j]`; `i` is `2 * x`; `j` is 2 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` is 2 if `j` was 1, or `j` is 3 if `j` was 2; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
