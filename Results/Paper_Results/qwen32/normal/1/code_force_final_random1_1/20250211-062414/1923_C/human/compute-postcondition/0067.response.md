Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` ≥ 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i, i]`, `c` is `[0, j]`, `i` is the next element in the list `l` plus `x`. If `x` equals 1, then `j` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `j` remains 1 if the next element in the list `l` equals 1; otherwise, `j` remains 0.`**

Explanation: The list `p` has been updated to include the value of `i` at the end, making its new value `[0, i, i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
