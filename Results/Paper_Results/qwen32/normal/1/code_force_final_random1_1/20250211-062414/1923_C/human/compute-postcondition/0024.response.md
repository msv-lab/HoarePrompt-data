The code appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Given the initial state, `c` originally contains the elements `[0, j, j]`. After appending `j` again, `c` will contain `[0, j, j, j]`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x, 2 * x, 3 * x]`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j, j, j]`; `i` is `3 * x`; `j` is 2 if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
