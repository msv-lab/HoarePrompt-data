The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `l`. This means the list `l` is now updated with new values read from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `s`) are not directly modified by this code snippet. However, since `l` has changed, the cumulative sums in `p` and the cumulative counts of 1s in `c` would need to be recalculated if they depend on `l`. Similarly, the sum of all elements in `l` (`i`), the count of 1s in `l` (`j`), and the values derived from `a` and `b` (`i` and `s`) would also need updates, but these are not performed in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is the list of integers read from the input, `p` is [0] followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is [0] followed by the cumulative counts of 1s encountered in `l` up to each point in the list, `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, `a` and `b` are the most recent integers read from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.**
