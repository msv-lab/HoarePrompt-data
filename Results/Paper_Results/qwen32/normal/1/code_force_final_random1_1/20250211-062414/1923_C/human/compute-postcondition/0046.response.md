Let's break down the given initial state and analyze the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` and `m-1`: Integers read from the input, with `m-1` being greater than or equal to 0.
   - `l`: A list of integers read from the input.
   - `p`: A list containing `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c`: A list containing `[0]` followed by the cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in `l`.
   - `a` and `b`: Integers read from the input.
   - `s`: Calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, representing the sum of elements in `l` from index `a-1` to `b-1`.
   - `i`: Calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, representing the count of `1`s in `l` from index `a-1` to `b-1`.
   - `j`: The total count of `1`s in `l`.

2. **Condition:**
   - The additional condition checks if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`.
   - If this condition holds, something specific happens (though it's not explicitly stated what that is in the provided code snippet). 
   - If the condition does not hold, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

### Analysis:

Given the print statement `print('YES')`, it is clear that the code will always print "YES" regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m-1`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `i`, or `j`.

The condition mentioned in the initial state does not affect the print statement directly because the print statement is outside any conditional block and will execute unconditionally.

### Conclusion:

The print statement will output "YES" without any dependency on the values of the variables or the condition specified.

Output: **YES**
