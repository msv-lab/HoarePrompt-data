To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is just `x`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `l`, so `x` will take on the value of the next element in the list.

Let's break down the adjustments needed:

1. **`x`**: This variable will be updated to the next element in the list `l`.
2. **`i`**: This variable is calculated based on the current value of `x` and the next element in the list `l`. Since `x` changes, `i` will also change.
3. **`j`**: This variable is determined based on the value of `x` and the next element in the list `l`. Since `x` changes, `j` will also change.
4. **`p`**: This list is updated based on the new value of `i`.
5. **`c`**: This list is updated based on the new value of `j`.

However, since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head (which is just `x`), we will focus on updating `x` and infer the implications for `i` and `j` based on the given conditions.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **Determine the current position in the list `l`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the current element being processed.
   - Therefore, `x` needs to be updated to the next element in the list `l`.

2. **Adjust `x`**:
   - Let's denote the current index of `x` in the list `l` as `current_index`.
   - The next value of `x` will be `l[current_index + 1]`.

3. **Infer `i` and `j`**:
   - `i` is the next element in the list `l` plus `x`. Since `x` is now the next element, `i` will be recalculated.
   - `j` depends on the value of `x` and the next element in the list `l`. Since `x` changes, `j` will also be recalculated.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- **`x`**: The next element in the list `l`.
- **`i`**: The next element in the list `l` plus the new `x`.
- **`j`**: Determined based on the new `x` and the next element in the list `l`.

Since we can only adjust `x`, we will express the new state in terms of `x`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` ≥ 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i, i]` where `i` is the next element in the list `l` plus `x`, `c` is `[0, j, j]` where `j` is determined based on the new `x` and the next element in the list `l`, `x` is the next element in the list `l`**.

This captures the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, focusing only on the variable `x` in the loop head.
