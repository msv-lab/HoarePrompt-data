Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers read from the input with m ≥ 0, l is a list of integers read from the input, p is [0] followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in l, c is [0] followed by the cumulative counts of 1s encountered in l up to each point in the list, i is the sum of all elements in l, j is the count of 1s in l.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
    s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers with `m` being greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is [0] followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is [0] followed by the cumulative counts of 1s encountered in `l` up to each point in the list, `a` and `b` are integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, then the conditions of the if part hold. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1 or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is `m - 1`, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is [0] followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is [0] followed by the cumulative counts of 1s encountered in `l` up to each point in the list, `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the if part executes; otherwise, the else part executes. In both cases, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is the original value of `m` (before decrementing), `l` is a list of integers, `p` is [0] followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is [0] followed by the cumulative counts of 1s encountered in `l` up to each point in the list, `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the if part executes; otherwise, the else part executes. Regardless of which part executes, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
