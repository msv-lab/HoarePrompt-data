Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a non-empty list of integers, `p` is [0, i], `c` is [0, j], `i` is `i + x`, `j` is `j + 1`, `a` and `b` are the most recent integers read from the input, and `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is that the value of `j` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
