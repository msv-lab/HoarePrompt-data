Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input with `m` greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is a list containing `[0]` followed by the cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in `l`, `i` and `j` are integers that represent the final count of `1`s in the last processed sublist and the total count of `1`s in `l` respectively after the last iteration. The loop has executed `m` times, and for each iteration, `a` and `b` were integers read from the input, `s` was the sum of elements in `l` from index `a` to `b`, and `i` was the count of `1`s in the sublist of `l` from index `a` to `b`. For each iteration, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, 'YES' was printed; otherwise, 'NO' was printed.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the program has processed `m` queries. For each query, it checked a specific condition related to the sum and count of `1`s in a sublist of `l` and printed 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged throughout the loop, while `i` and `j` reflect the final counts of `1`s as determined by the last processed sublist and the entire list `l`, respectively.
