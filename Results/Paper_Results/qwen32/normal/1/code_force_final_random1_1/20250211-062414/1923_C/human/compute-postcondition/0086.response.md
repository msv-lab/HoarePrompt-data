The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This changes the values of `a` and `b` from their initial states to the new values provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is `m - 1`, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is [0] followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is [0] followed by the cumulative counts of 1s encountered in `l` up to each point in the list, `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.**
