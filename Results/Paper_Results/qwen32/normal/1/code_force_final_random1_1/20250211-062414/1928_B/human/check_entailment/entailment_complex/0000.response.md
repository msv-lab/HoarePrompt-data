### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in an array after adding a permutation to it. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`t`) using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`) using `func_3()`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The array is deduplicated and sorted using `sorted(list(set(arr)))`. This step ensures that we only consider unique elements in the array in ascending order.
   - The variable `m` is set to the maximum value in the array, but it is not used further in the logic.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the maximum frequency of any number after adding a permutation.

3. **Finding Maximum Frequency:**
   - The program iterates over each unique element in the sorted array.
   - For each element `arr[i]`, it calculates the index `a` where `arr[i] + n` would fit in the sorted array using `bisect_left(arr, arr[i] + n)`.
   - The difference `d = a - i` represents the number of elements in the range `[arr[i], arr[i] + n - 1]` in the sorted array.
   - The variable `ans` is updated to the maximum value between `ans` and `d`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements for a test case, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the maximum frequency of any number after adding a permutation.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Handling Unique Elements:** By deduplicating the array, the program avoids unnecessary calculations and focuses only on unique elements.
- **Using `bisect_left`:** The use of `bisect_left` efficiently finds the position where `arr[i] + n` would fit, allowing the calculation of the number of elements in the range `[arr[i], arr[i] + n - 1]`.
- **Iterating Over Unique Elements:** The loop iterates over each unique element, ensuring that all possible ranges are considered.
- **Updating Maximum Frequency:** The variable `ans` keeps track of the highest frequency encountered during the iterations.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding a permutation. It efficiently handles the constraints and provides the correct output for the given examples.

### Your Response:
Reasoning: The program correctly deduplicates and sorts the array, uses binary search to find the appropriate ranges, and efficiently calculates the maximum frequency of any number after adding a permutation.
Correctness: **True**
