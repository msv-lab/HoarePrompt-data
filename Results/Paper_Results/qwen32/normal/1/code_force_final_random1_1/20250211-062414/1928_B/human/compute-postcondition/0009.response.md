The code multiplies the variable `tem` by `arr[i]`. Given the initial state, `tem` is initially `arr[1] * arr[0]` and `i` is `0`. Therefore, `tem *= arr[i]` translates to `tem = tem * arr[0]`, which means `tem` becomes `(arr[1] * arr[0]) * arr[0]` or `arr[1] * arr[0] * arr[0]`.

The values of `arr`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. Only `tem` is updated.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is a list containing `arr[1]` and `arr[1] * arr[0]`, `tem` is `arr[1] * arr[0] * arr[0]`, `i` is `0`**.
