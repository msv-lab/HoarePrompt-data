The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` was initially 1, so after the increment, `j` becomes 2. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer; `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at least 3; `count` is either 2 or 3; `flag` is True if the character at index `j` of `s` is '0' and the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is 2; `i` is `i + 1`.**
