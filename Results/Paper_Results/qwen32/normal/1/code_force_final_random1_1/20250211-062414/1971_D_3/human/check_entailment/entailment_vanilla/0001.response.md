### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of pieces a binary string needs to be cut into so that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

#### Key Observations:
- If the string is already sorted, no cuts are needed.
- Every time we encounter a transition from '1' to '0', it indicates that a cut is necessary because this transition cannot be resolved by rearranging the pieces without cutting.
- The number of such transitions plus one will give us the minimum number of pieces required.

#### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Counting Transitions**: For each string `s`, it initializes a counter `count` to zero.
3. **Iterating Through String**: It iterates through the string from the first character to the second last character.
   - If the current character is '1' and the next character is '0' (`int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1])`), it increments the `count`.
4. **Calculating Result**: After the loop, it prints `count + 1`. This is because the number of pieces is always one more than the number of transitions from '1' to '0'.

This approach correctly identifies the number of necessary cuts based on the transitions between '1' and '0', which aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces required to sort the binary string.

**Correctness:** **True**
