Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer; `s` is the input string; `count` is the number of transitions between different characters in `s` minus 1 if `flag` is True, otherwise it remains the same; `flag` is True if there is at least one '0' followed by a '1' in `s`; otherwise, it remains False; `j` is `len(s) - 1`.**
