Output State: **`t` is the input integer; `s` is a non-empty string; `count` is 2; `flag` is True; `j` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`; the character at index `j` of `s` is '0'; the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is '1'.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the variable `flag` has been set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values.
