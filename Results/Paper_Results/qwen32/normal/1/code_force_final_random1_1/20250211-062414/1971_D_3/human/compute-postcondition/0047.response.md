Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer; `s` is a non-empty string with a length of at least 3; `count` is either 2 or 3; `flag` is True if the character at index `j` of `s` is '0' and the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is 1; `i` is `i + 1`. Specifically, if the character at index `j` of `s` is '0' and the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is '1', then `flag` is True. Otherwise, `flag` remains False.**
