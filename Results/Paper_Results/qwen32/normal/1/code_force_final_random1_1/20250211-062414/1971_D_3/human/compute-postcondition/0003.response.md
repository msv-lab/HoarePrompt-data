The given code snippet initializes a variable `count` to 1. This does not affect the values of `t` or `s`. Therefore, the values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input (within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `s` is the new string input consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500; `count` is 1.**
