The code snippet `b = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
