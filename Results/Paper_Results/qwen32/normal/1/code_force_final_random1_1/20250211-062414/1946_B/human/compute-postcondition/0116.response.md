The code appends the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]` to the list `suf`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, the new element added to `suf` is the sum of the `i-th` elements of `suf` and `l`.

Since `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is incremented by 1, the precondition `n > 0` remains valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `suf` has a new element appended which is the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]`.**
