The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `suf`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `l`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `b[0]`; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `suf` is an empty list.**
