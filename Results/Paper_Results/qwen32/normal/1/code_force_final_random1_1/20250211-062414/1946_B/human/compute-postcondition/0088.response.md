The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `suf` is a list containing elements `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is a list containing `n+1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that point, `i` is 1, `j` is `j + n`. If `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm == -111`, then `sm` is updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]`.**
