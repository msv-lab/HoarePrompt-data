The code snippet `suf.append(0)` appends the integer `0` to the end of the list `suf`. Since `suf` was initially an empty list, after executing this line, `suf` will contain one element, which is `0`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `suf` is a list containing `[0]`; `smin` needs to be recalculated based on the new `l`; `i` is `n + 1`; `j` is `j + 1`; the condition for `sm` remains unchanged.**
