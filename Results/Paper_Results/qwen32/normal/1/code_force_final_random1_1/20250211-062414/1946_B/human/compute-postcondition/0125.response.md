To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `suf` is a list `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `smin` is `[0, suf[i + 1]]` if `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`, otherwise `smin` is `[0, 0]`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Since `i` is currently `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would terminate because the range function generates values from `0` to `n-1`. To start the next iteration, `i` needs to be reset to the first value in the range, which is `0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `0`.
- `n` remains the same (`n` must be greater than 0).

The values of `suf` and `smin` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head variables alone.

State: **`suf` is a list `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `i` is `0`, `smin` is `[0, suf[i + 1]]` if `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`, otherwise `smin` is `[0, 0]`, and `n` must be greater than 0**.
