The given code modifies the value of `sm` using the formula `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm`. Let's break down the changes:

1. The original value of `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for `0 <= i <= n`.
2. The new value of `sm` is calculated as `2 ** k * sm - sm`.

This simplifies to:
\[ \text{new\_sm} = (2^k - 1) \times \text{original\_sm} \]

Thus, the new value of `sm` is `(2 ** k - 1) * sm`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `suf` is a list containing elements `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is a list containing `n+1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that point, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `j + n`, `sm` is `(2 ** k - 1) * sm`.**
