To determine the output of the `print(sm)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and how the variable `sm` is updated based on the conditions provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Maximum Value Calculation**: The maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n` is maintained. This means there is some calculation involving arrays `suf` and `smin` to determine this maximum value, but it does not directly affect the value of `sm`.

2. **Condition-based Update of `sm`**:
   - If `sm < 0`, then `sm` is updated to `sm * 2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * 10`.
   - Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(sm * 2 + suf[n]) % 10`.

### Analysis:
- The value of `sm` after the update depends on its initial value and the value of `suf[n]` and `a`.
- Since the exact initial value of `sm`, `suf[n]`, and `a` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `sm` after the update.
- However, we can describe the updated value of `sm` based on the given conditions.

### Description of the Output:
- If `sm < 0` initially, the new value of `sm` will be `sm * 2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * 10`.
- If `sm >= 0` initially, the new value of `sm` will be `(sm * 2 + suf[n]) % 10`.

Given the lack of specific values for `sm`, `suf[n]`, and `a`, we can only describe the updated value of `sm` in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **sm (where sm is updated to `sm * 2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * 10` if `sm < 0`, otherwise `sm` is updated to `(sm * 2 + suf[n]) % 10`)**
