The code snippet modifies the value of `sm` by adding `(a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)` to it. The values of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n` and the relationship between `sm` and `suf[n]` remain unchanged. The value of `a` is also unchanged.

Given the initial state, `sm` was initially calculated as `sm * 2 + suf[n]`. After executing the code, `sm` is updated to `sm + (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

Output State: **The maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n` is maintained; `sm` is `sm * 2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)`; `a` is `(-sm) // (10`.**
