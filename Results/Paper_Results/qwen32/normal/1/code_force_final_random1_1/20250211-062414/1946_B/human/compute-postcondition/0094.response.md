To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies its variables based on the given conditions.

### Loop Analysis

The loop iterates over the range `n + 1` (from `i = 0` to `i = n`). During each iteration, it checks if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or if `sm == -111`. If either condition is true, it updates `sm` to `suf[i] - smin[i]`.

### Initial State Recap

- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n`: The integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0
- `k`: The integer value of `b[1]`
- `b`: A list of strings obtained from the input
- `l`: A new list of integers obtained from the input
- `suf`: A list containing cumulative sums of `l` starting from 0
- `smin`: A list containing the minimum values of `suf` up to each index
- `sm`: Initially set to -111
- `j`: Initially set to `j + n`
- `i`: Starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration

### Iteration Details

1. **First Iteration (`i = 0`)**:
   - Since `sm` is -111, `sm` gets updated to `suf[0] - smin[0]`.
   
2. **Second Iteration (`i = 1`)**:
   - If `suf[1] - smin[1] > sm`, `sm` gets updated to `suf[1] - smin[1]`.
   
3. **Third Iteration (`i = 2`)**:
   - If `suf[2] - smin[2] > sm`, `sm` gets updated to `suf[2] - smin[2]`.

### Final Iteration (`i = n`)

- The loop will continue until `i = n`.
- For each `i`, `sm` will be updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]` if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm`.

### Conclusion

After all iterations, `sm` will hold the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n`.

### Output State

- `t`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `suf`, `smin`, `j` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.
- `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes.
- `sm` will be the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for `0 <= i <= n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `suf` is a list containing elements `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is a list containing `n+1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that point, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `j + n`, `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for `0 <= i <= n`.**

In simpler terms, the loop calculates the maximum difference between the cumulative sum and the minimum cumulative sum up to each index and stores it in `sm`. All other variables remain as they were initially except for `i` which increments to `n + 1` and `sm` which holds the computed maximum difference.
