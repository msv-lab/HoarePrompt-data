The code snippet modifies the value of `sm` by adding `(a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0
- `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`
- `a` is the integer value `abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)`

After executing the line `sm += (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)`, the new value of `sm` is the old value of `sm` plus `(a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `a` is the integer value `abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)`; `sm` is updated to its previous value plus `(a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)`**.
