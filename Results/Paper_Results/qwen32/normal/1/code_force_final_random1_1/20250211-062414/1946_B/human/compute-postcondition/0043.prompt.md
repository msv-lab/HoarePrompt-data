Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `suf` is a list containing the integers 0, `l[0]`, `l[0] + l[1]`, ..., `l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]`; `smin` is a list containing `n+1` integers where each element is either the smallest cumulative sum encountered so far or the previous smallest cumulative sum; `sm` is -111.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111:
        sm = suf[i] - smin[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `suf` is a list containing the integers 0, `l[0]`, `l[0] + l[1]`, ..., `l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]`; `smin` is a list containing `n+1` integers where each element is either the smallest cumulative sum encountered so far or the previous smallest cumulative sum; if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm == -111`, then `sm` is updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `suf` is a list containing the integers 0, `l[0]`, `l[0] + l[1]`, ..., `l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]`; `smin` is a list containing `n+1` integers where each element is either the smallest cumulative sum encountered so far or the previous smallest cumulative sum; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm == -111`, then `sm` is updated to the difference `suf[i] - smin[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `suf` is a list containing the integers 0, `l[0]`, `l[0] + l[1]`, ..., `l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]`; `smin` is a list containing `n+1` integers where each element is either the smallest cumulative sum encountered so far or the previous smallest cumulative sum; `i` is 4; if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm == -111`, then `sm` is updated to the difference `suf[i] - smin[i]`. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
