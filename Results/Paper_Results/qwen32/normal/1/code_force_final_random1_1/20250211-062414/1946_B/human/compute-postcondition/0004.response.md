The code snippet assigns the integer value of `b[1]` to the variable `k`. This means the value of `k` changes to whatever integer `b[1]` represents. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `b[0]`; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
