To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variable `sm` evolves throughout the loop. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n`, and in each iteration, it checks if `suf[i] - smin[i]` is greater than the current value of `sm` (or if `sm` is still `-111`). If the condition is met, `sm` is updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]`.

Given the initial state and the outputs after the first three iterations, we can infer that `sm` will hold the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` encountered during the loop's execution.

Let's summarize the steps:
1. Initially, `sm` is `-111`.
2. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `n`, the loop checks if `suf[i] - smin[i]` is greater than `sm`.
3. If it is, `sm` is updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]`.
4. After all iterations, `sm` will be the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n`.

Thus, the final output state of `sm` will be the maximum difference between corresponding elements of `suf` and `smin` arrays.

Output State: **the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `sm` will hold the largest value obtained by subtracting the corresponding element of `smin` from `suf` for all valid indices `i`.
