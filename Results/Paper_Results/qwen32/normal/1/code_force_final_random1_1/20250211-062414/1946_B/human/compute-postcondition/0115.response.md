The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `suf` has a new element appended which is `suf[i] + l[i]`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1, we need to adjust `i` to reflect this increment. Therefore, `i` should be set to the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

Since `n` must be greater than 0 and we are only adjusting `i`, the state of `n` remains unchanged. The state of `suf` and `l` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted according to the rules given.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**
