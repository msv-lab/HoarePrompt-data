The given code snippet appends the value of `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Given that `i` is initialized to 0, `smin.append(suf[i + 1])` means `smin.append(suf[1])`.

Let's break down the changes:

- `smin` initially contains one element `[0]`.
- After the operation, `smin` will contain two elements: `[0, suf[1]]`.

No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of `b[0]` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `suf` is a list containing elements `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`; `smin` is a list containing elements `[0, suf[1]]`; if `sm` is less than 0, `a` is set to the absolute value of `sm` divided by 10. Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10^9 + 7)` and `a` remains unchanged; `j` is `j + 1`; `i` is 0**.
