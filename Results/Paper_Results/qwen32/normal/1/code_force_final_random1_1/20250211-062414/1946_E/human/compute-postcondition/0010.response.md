To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
```

This line of code calls a function `func_1` with two arguments: `b` and `a % b`. The function returns two values which are assigned to the variables `c` and `d`.

Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that `c` and `d` will be the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
- `b` is greater than 0.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
- `a` is not divisible by `b`.

After the function call, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and new variables `c` and `d` are introduced with the values returned by `func_1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers, `b` is greater than 0, `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, `a` is not divisible by `b`, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`.**
