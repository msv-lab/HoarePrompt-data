To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to understand the problem it's supposed to solve and how the program attempts to solve it.

### Problem Understanding

The problem involves determining the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific indices for their prefix and suffix maximums. A prefix maximum at index `i` means that the element at that index is greater than all elements before it. Similarly, a suffix maximum at index `i` means that the element at that index is greater than all elements after it.

The solution involves combinatorial mathematics, specifically calculating the number of ways to arrange numbers such that the specified indices are prefix and suffix maximums. This often involves using modular arithmetic due to the potentially large numbers involved.

### Program Analysis

The provided code consists of two functions:

1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function appears to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `a` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. The modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `a` is a value `x` such that `(b * x) % a == 1`. This is useful for division under modular arithmetic.

2. **func_2(a, b)**: This function uses `func_1` to compute `(a / b) % 1000000007`, which is effectively computing the division of `a` by `b` under modulo `1000000007`.

However, the provided code does not directly address the problem of counting permutations with specific prefix and suffix maximums. It only provides utility functions for modular arithmetic, which are necessary but not sufficient to solve the problem.

### Missing Components

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to:
- Parse the input to get the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
- For each test case, determine the number of valid permutations that satisfy the conditions of having specific prefix and suffix maximums.
- Use combinatorial techniques and possibly dynamic programming to count these permutations efficiently.
- Output the results modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Since the provided code does not include any logic to handle the actual problem-solving part (i.e., counting permutations), it cannot be considered correct for the given problem.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided code is incomplete and does not solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description is:

Correctness: **False**
