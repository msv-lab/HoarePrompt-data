Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code includes two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) but does not implement the main logic required to solve the problem described. The problem requires calculating the number of permutations that match given prefix and suffix maximums, which is not addressed by the current code.

The given functions seem to be related to modular arithmetic operations (likely for computing modular inverses), but they do not handle the core logic of counting valid permutations based on the prefix and suffix maximums.

To solve the problem, we would need to implement a function that:
1. Parses the input for each test case.
2. Uses combinatorial methods to count the number of permutations that satisfy the conditions on prefix and suffix maximums.
3. Outputs the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Since the provided code does not include this logic, it cannot be considered correct for the given problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
