Given the initial state and the code snippet, we know:

- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
- `b` is greater than 0.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
- `a` is divisible by `b` (i.e., `a % b == 0`).

The code snippet is:
```python
return 1, -(a // b - 1)
```

We need to determine the values being returned based on these conditions.

Since `a` is divisible by `b`, `a // b` gives the exact quotient without any remainder. Let's denote `a // b` as `q`. Therefore, `q` is an integer.

The expression `-(a // b - 1)` simplifies to `-(q - 1)`, which is equivalent to `1 - q`.

Thus, the return statement will return the tuple `(1, 1 - q)`.

Given that `q = a // b`, we can substitute back to get the final return values.

Output State: **The program returns (1, 1 - (a // b))**, where `a // b` is the integer quotient of `a` divided by `b`.
