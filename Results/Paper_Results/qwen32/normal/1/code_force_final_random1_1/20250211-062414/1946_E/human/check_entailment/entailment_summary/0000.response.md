### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximums, as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness based on the provided functions and their execution summaries.

#### Key Points to Consider:

1. **Factorial Precomputation**:
   - The program precomputes factorials up to `200001` modulo `10^9 + 7` and stores them in the `facts` list. This is necessary for calculating combinations efficiently later in the program.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
   - It also reads the indices of the prefix maximums `p` and the indices of the suffix maximums `s`.

3. **Initial Checks**:
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index `p[-1]` matches the first suffix maximum index `s[0]`, if the first prefix maximum index `p[0]` is `1`, and if the last suffix maximum index `s[-1]` is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, the program outputs `0` because no valid permutation exists under these circumstances.

4. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of valid permutations by computing combinations using the precomputed factorials.
   - It uses `func_2` to compute modular inverses for division operations, which is crucial for calculating combinations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

5. **Combination Calculations for Suffix Maximums**:
   - For each suffix maximum index `x` in `s`, the program calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements before `x` and updates the total count `ans` accordingly.

6. **Combination Calculations for Prefix Maximums**:
   - Similarly, for each prefix maximum index `x` in `p` (excluding the first and last), the program calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements between consecutive prefix maximums and updates `ans`.

7. **Final Adjustments**:
   - The program multiplies `ans` by the factorial of the gaps between consecutive prefix and suffix maximums to account for all possible arrangements within these gaps.

8. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the result `ans` for each test case.

#### Verification Against Provided Functions:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - This function computes the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity for two numbers `a` and `b`. It is used to find the modular inverse in `func_2`.
  - The execution summary correctly describes its functionality.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - This function computes the modular inverse of `b` modulo `10^9 + 7` using `func_1` and multiplies it by `a` modulo `10^9 + 7`.
  - The execution summary accurately reflects its purpose and implementation.

### Conclusion:

Given the detailed breakdown and verification of the program's logic and the provided functions, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. It handles the input constraints, performs necessary calculations, and outputs the correct results based on the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
