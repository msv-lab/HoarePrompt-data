a is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple containing three integers (n, m1, m2) representing the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums respectively, followed by two lists of integers p and s of lengths m1 and m2 respectively, representing the indices of the prefix and suffix maximums in increasing order. Each test case satisfies 1 ≤ m1, m2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all n across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
