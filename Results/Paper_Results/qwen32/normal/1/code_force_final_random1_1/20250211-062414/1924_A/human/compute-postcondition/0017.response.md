The only variable in the loop head is `ss`, which represents each character in the string `s` during each iteration of the loop. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `ss` and how it changes as the loop progresses.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `m` is the third integer from the input.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `s`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string.

Since `ss` iterates over each character in `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `ss` should be the next character in the string `s`.

Let's denote the current character of `ss` at the end of the previous iteration as `s[j]`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `ss` should be `s[j+1]`.

However, since we don't know the exact position `j` of `ss` in the string `s` from the given state, we can generalize that `ss` should be the next character in the sequence. If `ss` was the last character in the string `s` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have terminated, so we assume `ss` is not the last character.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `ss` is now the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1` if previously true, otherwise unchanged, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1` otherwise 0, `ans` is `s` if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1` otherwise an empty string**.

Since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, and `ss` is the only variable in the loop head that changes, we can simplify this to:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`**.
