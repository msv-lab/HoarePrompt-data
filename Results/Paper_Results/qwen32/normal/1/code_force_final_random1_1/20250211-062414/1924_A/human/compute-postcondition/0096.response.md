Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\), `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input, `s` is the string provided as input, `cnt` is the number of complete subsets of `k` unique characters found in `s` and is less than `n`, `cur` is 0 if the last subset was completed; otherwise, it reflects the incomplete subset, `ans` is the string containing the last character of each complete subset of `k` unique characters, `tmp` is an empty string, and the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0**
