t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The string s is of length m and consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 10^6, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
