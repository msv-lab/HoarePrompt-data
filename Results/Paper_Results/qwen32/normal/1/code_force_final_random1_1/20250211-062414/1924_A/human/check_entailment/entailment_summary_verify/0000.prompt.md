You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        cnt = 0
        cur = 0
        ans = ''
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
                ans += ss
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                    break
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` non-overlapping sequences of `k` unique characters. If it does, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string by appending the smallest missing character and enough 'a's to reach `n` sequences, then prints this constructed string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in the logic used to determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s`. The current implementation incorrectly counts the number of unique combinations of the first `k` letters found in `s`, but it does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are present as subsequences.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Counting Mechanism**: The variable `cur` is used to track the presence of the first `k` letters in `s` using bit manipulation. However, this mechanism does not help in checking if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences. It merely checks if all `k` letters appear in `s`.

2. **Subsequence Check**: The problem requires checking if all possible strings of length `n` (which is `k^n` in total) are subsequences of `s`. The current implementation does not perform this check correctly. It only counts how many times all `k` letters appear consecutively in `s` and does not consider the order or the exact sequence required.

3. **Generating Missing Subsequence**: Even if the code could correctly determine if all subsequences are present, the logic for generating a missing subsequence is flawed. The generated string might not be a valid missing subsequence because it does not account for the actual subsequences present in `s`.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
- **Expected Output**: `NO aa`
- **Actual Output**: `NO ab`

In this case, the string `aa` is not a subsequence of `abb`, but the program incorrectly outputs `ab` as the missing subsequence. This is because the program does not properly check for all possible subsequences of length `n`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we would need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` letters and check if each one is a subsequence of `s`. If we find a string that is not a subsequence, we output `NO` followed by that string. If all strings are subsequences, we output `YES`.

Given the complexity of this approach, especially considering the constraints, a more efficient method involving dynamic programming or bitmasking might be necessary to handle the large input sizes. However, the provided code does not implement such a solution.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
