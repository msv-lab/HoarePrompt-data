The given code snippet modifies the value of `cur` by performing a bitwise left shift operation on `1` by the number of positions specified by `cur_ss`, and then adds the result to `cur`. 

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `cur`, which is incremented by `1 << cur_ss`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `ss` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `ss`, `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), `cur` is incremented by `1 << cur_ss`.**
