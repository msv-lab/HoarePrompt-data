Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `s`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string.**
