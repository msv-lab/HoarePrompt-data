Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is incremented by 1; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`; `cur` is either 0 or `(1 << k) - 1` depending on the last set of characters; `ans` contains the accumulated characters `ss` when `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`; `tmp` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`. If `cur & 1 << i` equals 0, then `cur` remains unchanged and `tmp` is set to `'a'`, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string and `cur` remains unchanged. `ans` contains the accumulated characters `ss` when `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`. If `cur & 1 << i` equals 0, then `cur` remains unchanged and `tmp` is set to `'a'`, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string and `cur` remains unchanged. `ans` contains the accumulated characters `ss` when `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`. If `cur & (1 << i) == 0`, then `tmp` is set to 'c' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `tmp` or the control flow.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
