The code snippet sets `cur` to 0. This means that regardless of its previous value, `cur` is now explicitly set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\), `ss` is the next element in the list `s`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, `ans` remain unchanged, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
