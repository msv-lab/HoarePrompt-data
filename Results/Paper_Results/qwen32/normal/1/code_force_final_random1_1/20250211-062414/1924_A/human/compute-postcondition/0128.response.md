Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, `ans` is `ss`, and `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of the character `ss` in the alphabet; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `cur` remains unchanged, `ans` remains an empty string, and `cur_ss` remains the zero-based index of the character `ss` in the alphabet.**
