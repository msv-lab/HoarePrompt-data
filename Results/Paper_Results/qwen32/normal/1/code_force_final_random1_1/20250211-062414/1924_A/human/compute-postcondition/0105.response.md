The given code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `tmp`. Specifically, it sets `tmp` to the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the value of `i`.

Given the initial state, `i` is 2. Therefore, `tmp` will be set to `chr(ord('a') + 2)`, which is `chr(97 + 2)` or `chr(99)`, resulting in the character `'c'`.

No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `i` is 2; `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input; `s` is the string provided as input; `cnt` is the number of complete subsets of `k` unique characters found in `s` and is less than `n`; `cur` is 0 if the last subset was completed; otherwise, it reflects the incomplete subset; `ans` is the string containing the last character of each complete subset of `k` unique characters; `tmp` is `'c'`.**
