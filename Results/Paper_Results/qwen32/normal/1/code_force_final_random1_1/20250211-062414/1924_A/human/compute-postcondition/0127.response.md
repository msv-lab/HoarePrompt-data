The code `ans += ss` appends the value of `ss` to the string `ans`. Since `ans` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `ans` will be equal to the value of `ss`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is 1; `cur` is 0; `ans` is `ss`; `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of the character `ss` in the alphabet.**
