The given code snippet modifies the value of `cur` by performing a bitwise left shift operation on `1` by the amount specified by `cur_ss` and then adding the result to `cur`. Here's the updated state:

- `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cnt`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\), `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input, `s` is a non-empty string provided as input, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur` is `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`, `cnt` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**
