The code snippet calculates the ASCII value difference between the character `ss` and the character `'a'`, and assigns this difference to the variable `cur_ss`. 

Given that `ss` is the next element in the list `s`, and assuming `ss` is a lowercase letter (since it's being compared to `'a'`), `ord(ss) - ord('a')` will give an integer value between 0 and 25 (inclusive).

Therefore, the updated value of `cur_ss` will be this calculated integer.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\), `ss` is the next element in the list `s`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans` remain unchanged, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet.**
