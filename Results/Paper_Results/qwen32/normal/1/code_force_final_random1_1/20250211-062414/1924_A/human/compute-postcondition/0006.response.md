The given code snippet initializes a new variable `ans` and assigns it an empty string. None of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`) are modified.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is the string provided by the input, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string.**
