The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the character stored in `ss` to the string `ans`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, and `cur_ss`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to include `ss` at the end, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `ss` in the alphabet.**
