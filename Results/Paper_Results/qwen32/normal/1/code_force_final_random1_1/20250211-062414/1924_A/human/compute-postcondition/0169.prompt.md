Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    ans = ''
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
            ans += ss
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                break
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\). `i` is 0 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k`. `n`, `k`, `m` remain the integers provided as input. `s` remains the string provided as input. `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively in `s`. `cur` is 0 or holds the bit representation of the last incomplete sequence of unique characters. `ans` contains the last character of each sequence of `k` unique characters. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is extended by 'a' repeated (`n - cnt - 1`) times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input; `s` is the string provided as input; `cnt` is the number of complete subsets of `k` unique characters found in `s`; `cur` is 0 if the last subset was completed; otherwise, it reflects the incomplete subset; `ans` is the string containing the last character of each complete subset of `k` unique characters. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is set to 1. Otherwise, `i` is set to \(k-1\) if the \(k-1\)-th bit of `cur` is 0, and `ans` is updated to include `tmp` plus 'a' repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times, where `tmp` is the character `'a' + (k-1)` if the \(k-1\)-th bit of `cur` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `cur` remains either 0 or `(1 << k) - 1` depending on the last set of characters, and `ans` contains the accumulated characters `ss` when `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`. Otherwise, `i` is set to `k-1`, `tmp` is `'a'`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + 'a' + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
