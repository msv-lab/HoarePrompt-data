The code snippet calculates the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a', and assigns this difference to `cur_ss`. 

Given that `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `ss`, and assuming `ss` is a lowercase letter (since the calculation involves subtracting the ASCII value of 'a'), `cur_ss` will be an integer between 0 and 25 inclusive.

The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged. Only `cur_ss` is newly defined.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `ss`, `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z').**
