The given code snippet appends the value of `tmp` to the string `ans`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\).
- `i` is \(k-1\) if the \(k-1\)-th bit of `cur` is 0.
- `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input.
- `s` is the string provided as input.
- `cnt` is the number of complete subsets of `k` unique characters found in `s` and is less than `n`.
- `cur` is 0 if the last subset was completed; otherwise, it reflects the incomplete subset.
- `ans` is the string containing the last character of each complete subset of `k` unique characters.
- `tmp` is the character `'a' + (k-1)` if the \(k-1\)-th bit of `cur` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.

After executing the line `ans += tmp`, the value of `ans` will be updated to include the value of `tmp` at the end of the existing string.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `i` is \(k-1\) if the \(k-1\)-th bit of `cur` is 0; `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input; `s` is the string provided as input; `cnt` is the number of complete subsets of `k` unique characters found in `s` and is less than `n`; `cur` is 0 if the last subset was completed; otherwise, it reflects the incomplete subset; `ans` is the string containing the last character of each complete subset of `k` unique characters plus `tmp`; `tmp` is the character `'a' + (k-1)` if the \(k-1\)-th bit of `cur` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.**
