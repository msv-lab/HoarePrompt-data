The code snippet initializes a new variable `cur` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, or `cnt`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `cur` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `n`, `k`, and `m` are the integers read from the input; `s` is a string read from the input; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0.**
