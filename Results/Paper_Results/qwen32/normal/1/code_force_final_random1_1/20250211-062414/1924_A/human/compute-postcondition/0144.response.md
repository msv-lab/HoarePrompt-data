Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` in the previous iteration, `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `ans` includes `ss` at the end. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged and `ans` remains unchanged. `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `ss` in the alphabet. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1` in the current iteration, `cur` is reset to 0 and `ans` includes `ss` appended to it.**
