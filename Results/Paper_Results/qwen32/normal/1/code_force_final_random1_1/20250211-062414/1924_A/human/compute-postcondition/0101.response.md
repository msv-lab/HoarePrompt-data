The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `tmp`. Specifically, `tmp` is set to the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the value of `i`. This means if `i` is 1, `tmp` becomes `'b'`, if `i` is 2, `tmp` becomes `'c'`, and so on.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `tmp`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `i` is 1; `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input; `s` is the string provided as input; `cnt` is the number of complete subsets of `k` unique characters found in `s` and is less than `n`; `cur` is 0 if the last subset was completed; otherwise, it reflects the incomplete subset; `ans` is the string containing the last character of each complete subset of `k` unique characters; `tmp` is the character 'a' + `i`.**
