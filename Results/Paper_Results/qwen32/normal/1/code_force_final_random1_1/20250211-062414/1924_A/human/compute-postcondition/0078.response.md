Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\), `i` is 1 if `cnt + 1` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input, `s` is a non-empty string provided as input, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, `ans` is unchanged, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `cur` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
