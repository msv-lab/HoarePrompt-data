Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `i` is 2; `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input; `s` is the string provided as input; `cnt` is the number of complete subsets of `k` unique characters found in `s` and is less than `n`; `cur` is 0 if the last subset was completed; otherwise, it reflects the incomplete subset; `ans` is the string containing the last character of each complete subset of `k` unique characters; `tmp` is `'c'` if the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string. If the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
