Given the initial state, let's analyze the provided Python code snippet:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\).
- `i` is set to 1 because `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.
- `n`, `k`, `m` are integers provided as input.
- `s` is a string provided as input.
- `cnt` is the number of complete subsets of `k` unique characters found in `s` and is greater than or equal to `n`.
- `cur` is 0 if the last subset was completed; otherwise, it reflects the incomplete subset.
- `ans` is the string containing the last character of each complete subset of `k` unique characters.

The code snippet contains only one line:
```python
print('YES')
```

This line does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
