Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `i` is `k + 1`; `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input; `s` is a non-empty string provided as input; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0; `ans` is an empty string; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. Additionally, the bitwise AND operation between `cur` and `1 << cur_ss` results in 0, indicating that the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is not set.**
