The given code modifies the value of `cur` by performing a bitwise left shift operation on `1` by `cur_ss` positions and then adding the result to `cur`. 

Given that `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `ss` in the alphabet, the value of `1 << cur_ss` will be `2` raised to the power of `cur_ss`.

Since `cur` is incremented by this value, the new value of `cur` will be its previous value plus `2^cur_ss`.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cnt`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur` is incremented by `2^cur_ss`, `cnt` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `ss` in the alphabet**.
