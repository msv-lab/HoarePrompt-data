Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is 1; `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`; `ans` is an empty string; `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of the character `ss` in the alphabet.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
