The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the value of `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is the third integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `ss`, `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is incremented by `1 << cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
