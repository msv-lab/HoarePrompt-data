The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the current state:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\)
- `i` is 0
- `n`, `k` remain the integers provided as input with `k` greater than 0
- `m` remains the integer provided as input
- `s` remains the string provided as input
- `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively in `s` and `cnt` is less than `n`
- `cur` is 0 or holds the bit representation of the last incomplete sequence of unique characters with the `i`-th bit not set if the `i`-th bit was not set, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged
- `ans` contains the last character of each sequence of `k` unique characters
- `tmp` is 'a' if the `i`-th bit of `cur` was not set, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\), `i` is 1, `n`, `k` remain the integers provided as input with `k` greater than 0, `m` remains the integer provided as input, `s` remains the string provided as input, `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively in `s` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0 or holds the bit representation of the last incomplete sequence of unique characters with the `i`-th bit not set if the `i`-th bit was not set, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged, `ans` contains the last character of each sequence of `k` unique characters, `tmp` is 'a' if the `i`-th bit of `cur` was not set, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string**
