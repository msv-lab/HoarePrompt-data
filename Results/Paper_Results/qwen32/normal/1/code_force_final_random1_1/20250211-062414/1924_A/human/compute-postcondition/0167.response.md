To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the operations performed on the variables.

### Initial State:
- `i` is set to `k-1`.
- `tmp` is set to the string `'a'`.
- `ans` is updated to `ans + 'a' + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`.

### Analysis:
The key variable here is `ans`. The expression `ans + 'a' + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` modifies the value of `ans` by appending a specific string pattern to it.

Let's break down the expression:
- `'a'`: This is a single character string.
- `'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`: This creates a string consisting of `(n - cnt - 1)` number of `'a'` characters.

So, the entire expression `ans + 'a' + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` appends one `'a'` followed by `(n - cnt - 1)` number of `'a'` characters to the current value of `ans`.

### Output Description:
The final value of `ans` after the update will be the original `ans` concatenated with a string that starts with one `'a'` and is followed by `(n - cnt - 1)` additional `'a'` characters.

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact initial value of `ans`, but we know how it is modified. Therefore, the output will be described in terms of this modification.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the original value of ans concatenated with 'a' followed by (n - cnt - 1) additional 'a' characters)**
