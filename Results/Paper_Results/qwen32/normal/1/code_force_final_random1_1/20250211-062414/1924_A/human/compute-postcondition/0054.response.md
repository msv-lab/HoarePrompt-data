The code snippet `ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` appends a string of 'a's to the variable `ans`. The length of the string of 'a's is determined by the expression `(n - cnt - 1)`. 

Given the initial state, `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively in `s` and is less than `n`. Therefore, `(n - cnt - 1)` will be a non-negative integer.

After executing the code, `ans` will now include the previously stored characters plus the newly added string of 'a's.

Output State: **t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000; i is k; n, k, m remain the integers provided as input; s remains the string provided as input; cnt is the number of times k unique characters were found consecutively in s and cnt is less than n; cur is 0 or holds the bit representation of the last incomplete sequence of unique characters; ans contains the last character of each sequence of k unique characters plus 'a' repeated (n - cnt - 1) times; tmp is ''.**
