Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= \(10^5\); `n`, `k`, `m` are the integers provided as input; `s` is the string provided as input; `cnt` is the number of complete subsets of `k` unique characters found in `s`; `cur` is 0 if the last subset was completed; otherwise, it reflects the incomplete subset; `ans` is the string containing the last character of each complete subset of `k` unique characters. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is set to 1. Otherwise, `i` is set to \(k-1\) if the \(k-1\)-th bit of `cur` is 0, and `ans` is updated to include `tmp` plus 'a' repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times, where `tmp` is the character `'a' + (k-1)` if the \(k-1\)-th bit of `cur` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.**
