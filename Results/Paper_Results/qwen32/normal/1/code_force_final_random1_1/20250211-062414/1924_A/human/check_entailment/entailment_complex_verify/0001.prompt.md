You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: `t` is 0; `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` are the values from the last iteration; `cnt` is the number of complete sequences of `k` unique characters found in the last `s`; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence was complete, otherwise it holds the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence; `ans` contains the last character of each complete sequence of `k` unique characters, or is extended with the smallest missing character and enough 'a's to reach `n` sequences if `cnt` is less than `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` non-overlapping sequences of `k` unique characters. If it does, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string by appending the smallest missing character and enough 'a's to reach `n` sequences, then prints this constructed string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appear as subsequences in a given string `s`. If not, we need to find one such string that does not appear as a subsequence.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the string `s` and keeping track of the unique characters encountered so far using a bitmask (`cur`). The bitmask helps in determining if we have seen all `k` characters at least once. However, this approach does not correctly address the requirement of checking all possible combinations of length `n`.

#### Key Issues:

1. **Bitmask Usage**: The bitmask `cur` is used to track the presence of characters, but it does not help in checking subsequences of length `n`. It only checks if all `k` characters are present at least once in the sequence.

2. **Counting Subsequences**: The variable `cnt` is incremented when all `k` characters are seen, but this does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present. It only counts sequences where all `k` characters appear at least once.

3. **Generating Missing Subsequence**: The logic for generating a missing subsequence is flawed. It tries to append characters that haven't been seen yet, but this does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid missing subsequence.

4. **Efficiency Concerns**: The approach might not be efficient enough given the constraints, especially since it doesn't correctly handle the generation of all possible subsequences of length `n`.

### Correctness

Given the issues mentioned above, the provided solution is incorrect. It fails to properly check for all possible subsequences of length `n` and incorrectly generates a missing subsequence.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**

The solution does not correctly implement the required functionality to solve the problem as described. A more appropriate approach would involve generating all possible subsequences of length `n` and checking their presence in `s`, which can be computationally expensive given the constraints. Alternatively, a more efficient algorithmic approach might be needed to handle the problem within the given limits.
