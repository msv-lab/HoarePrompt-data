To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[i]` is `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is its original value minus `2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is its original value minus `2 * opNum`, and all other elements of `a` remain unchanged.
- `opNum` is equal to the original value of `a[i]`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- If `a[i]` was less than 0 before the operation, `stop` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains False.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(0, n - 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

The variable `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[i]` is `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is its original value minus `2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is its original value minus `2 * opNum`, and all other elements of `a` remain unchanged; `opNum` is equal to the original value of `a[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `stop` remains False unless `a[i]` was less than 0 before the operation.** 

However, focusing only on the variables in the loop head (`i` and `n`):

State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` remains the same.**
