### Reasoning:

The provided code snippet attempts to solve the problem by checking certain conditions related to the first two and last two elements of the array. However, the logic implemented in the code does not fully capture the requirements of the problem. Here's why:

1. **Operation Constraints**: The operation can only be applied on indices \( i \) such that \( 2 \leq i \leq n-1 \). This means that the first and last elements cannot be directly modified by the operation.

2. **Parity and Values Check**: The code checks if the first element is odd and the second element is not exactly 2 more than the first, or if the last element is odd and the second last element is not exactly 2 more than the last. These checks do not ensure that the entire array can be reduced to zeros through the allowed operations.

3. **General Case Handling**: The problem requires determining if the entire array can be reduced to zeros using the specified operation any number of times. The provided solution does not address how the intermediate elements can be manipulated to achieve this goal.

4. **Counterexample**: Consider the test case `[0, 1, 3, 3, 1]` which the code correctly identifies as "YES". However, the logic does not generalize to other cases where the array can still be reduced to zeros but does not meet the specific parity and value conditions checked by the code.

### Conclusion:

The current implementation does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the allowed operations. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
