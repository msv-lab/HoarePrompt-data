Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input. If the current element `a[i]` is less than 0, `stop` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains False.**
