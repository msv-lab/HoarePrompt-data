Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: `i` is 4, `n` is at least 6, `opNum` is `a[4]`, and if `a[4]` is less than 0, `stop` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Code Snippet:
```python
a[i] -= opNum
```

Since `i` is 4, the operation `a[i] -= opNum` translates to `a[4] -= a[4]`. This means `a[4]` is being subtracted from itself, resulting in `a[4]` becoming 0.

The value of `opNum` is `a[4]`, and since `a[4]` is now 0, `opNum` is also 0. The condition `if a[4] is less than 0` is no longer relevant because `a[4]` is now 0, not less than 0. Therefore, the `stop` variable remains unchanged (it was not explicitly set to False, so it retains its previous state, which could be either True or False depending on the initial conditions).

The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is at least 6, `a[4]` is 0, `opNum` is 0, and `stop` retains its previous value (either True or False).**
