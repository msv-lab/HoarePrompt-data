Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is at least 6, `opNum` is `a[4]`, and if `a[4]` is less than 0, `stop` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The value of `opNum` is now set to the value of `a[4]`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
