The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `b`. This means that the value of `b` changes from its initial state to the newly read list of integers.

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. The conditions related to the elements of `b` (whether they are odd and satisfy certain differences) are not affected by the current code snippet since it only updates the value of `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is the input integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
