The given code snippet modifies the value of `a[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `opNum` from it. Here's the updated state of the variables after the operation:

- `i` remains `i + 1` as no operation affects its value.
- `n` remains an integer read from input such that \(3 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `stop` remains True if `a[i]` was less than 0 before the operation; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- `opNum` remains `a[i]` before the operation.
- `a[i]` is set to 0 as per the initial state.
- `a[i + 1]` is modified to `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`.

Given these points, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `stop` is True if `a[i]` was less than 0 before the operation, `opNum` is `a[i]` before the operation, `a[i]` is 0, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`.**
