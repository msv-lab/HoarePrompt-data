The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `b`. The variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is an input integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
