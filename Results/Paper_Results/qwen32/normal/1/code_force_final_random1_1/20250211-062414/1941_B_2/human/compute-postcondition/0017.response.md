The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be exactly what is specified in the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is described as an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, this variable is not referenced in the `print` statement.
2. **Variable `a`**: It is described as an input integer. Again, this variable is not referenced in the `print` statement.
3. **Variable `b`**: It is described as a list of integers obtained from the input. This variable is also not referenced in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement only contains the string `'NO'`, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **NO**
