Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` must be greater than or equal to 1; for each test case, `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `stop` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 2):
    if a[i] < 0:
        print('NO')
        stop = True
        break
    opNum = a[i]
    a[i] -= opNum
    a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
    a[i + 2] -= opNum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[i]` is 0, `a[i + 1]` is its original value minus `2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is its original value minus `opNum`, and all other elements of `a` remain unchanged; `stop` is True if `a[i]` was less than 0 before the operation, otherwise `stop` remains False; `opNum` is equal to the original value of `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[i]` is `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is its original value minus `2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is its original value minus `2 * opNum`, and all other elements of `a` remain unchanged; `opNum` is equal to the original value of `a[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` was less than 0 before the operation, `stop` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` remains the same; `a[i]` is 0; `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged; `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged; `opNum` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
