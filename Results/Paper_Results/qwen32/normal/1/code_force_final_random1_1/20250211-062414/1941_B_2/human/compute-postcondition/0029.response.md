The code assigns the value of `a[i]` to `opNum`. No other variables are modified by this line of code. The conditions regarding `stop` and breaking out of loops remain unchanged unless `a[i] < 0` is true, which is not specified here.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` remains the same; `opNum` is `a[i]`.**
