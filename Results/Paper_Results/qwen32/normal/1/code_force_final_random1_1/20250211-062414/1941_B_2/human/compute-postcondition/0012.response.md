In this task, the initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but the `print` statement does not depend on these variables. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Let's break down the given information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will always output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
