Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from input such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first `n-2` elements are 0, and the last two elements are unchanged; `stop` is True.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration in a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
