Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is an input integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the first element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second element minus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second-to-last element minus 2, then the if block's postcondition holds. Otherwise, the else block's postcondition holds, which is identical to the initial state.**
