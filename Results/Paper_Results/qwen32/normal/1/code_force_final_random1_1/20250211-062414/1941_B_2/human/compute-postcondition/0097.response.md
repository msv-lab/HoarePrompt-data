To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and the conditions that control the loop's execution.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(0, n - 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the description, we know:
- `_` is incremented by 1 (though this variable is not explicitly used in the loop head, it does not affect our analysis).
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution directly).
- `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution directly).
- `n` is at least 3 (this is part of the loop condition).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where specific elements are modified based on `opNum`.
- `opNum` is `a[i]`.
- `stop` remains False unless `a[i] < 0`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is part of the loop condition and does not change within the loop.
- The other variables (`t`, `numTest`, `a`, `opNum`, `stop`) are not part of the loop head and do not need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[i]` is `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`, and `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - opNum`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `stop` remains False unless `a[i] < 0`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

However, since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head, the final adjusted state is:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is at least 3**.
