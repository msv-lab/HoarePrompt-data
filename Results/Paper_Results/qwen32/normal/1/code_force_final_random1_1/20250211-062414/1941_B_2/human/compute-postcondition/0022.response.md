Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks specific conditions related to the parity and values of the first two and last two elements of the list `a`. It prints 'YES' if the conditions are met, otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
