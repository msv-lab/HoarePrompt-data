#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of strings, where each string b in s consists of lowercase Latin letters and represents the encoded result of some original string s, with the total length of all strings in s not exceeding 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    i, j = 0, len(unique_chars) - 1
    for char in s:
        if char in unique_chars:
            s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
            j -= 1
        else:
            unique_chars.insert(i, char)
            i += 1
            j += 1
        
    #State: `s` is a list of strings where each character has been replaced by a character from `unique_chars` in reverse order, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of all unique characters from the original `s`, `i` is the count of new unique characters added, and `j` is -1.
    return ''.join(unique_chars)
    #The program returns a string that is the concatenation of all unique characters from the original list `s`, sorted in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of strings `s`, where each string consists of lowercase Latin letters. It processes the list to identify all unique characters present across all strings in `s`. The function then returns a single string containing these unique characters sorted in ascending order.
