Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the problem description. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**: The code attempts to replace each character in the encoded string `s` with its corresponding symmetric character from the sorted list of unique characters. However, the replacement is done incorrectly because it replaces all occurrences of a character in the string `s` at once, which is not the intended behavior. Instead, each occurrence of a character in the encoded string should be replaced with its corresponding symmetric character from `r`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Characters**: The code maintains a list `unique_chars` and tries to insert characters into it, but this logic is flawed. The list `unique_chars` should only contain unique characters from the encoded string `s`, sorted alphabetically. The insertion logic (`unique_chars.insert(i, char)`) is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem at hand.

3. **Symmetric Character Mapping**: The code does not create a mapping between characters in `r` and their symmetric counterparts. Instead, it attempts to replace characters directly without establishing this mapping, leading to incorrect results.

To fix these issues, we need to:
- Extract the unique characters from the encoded string `s` and sort them to form `r`.
- Create a mapping between each character in `r` and its symmetric counterpart.
- Replace each character in the encoded string `s` with its mapped symmetric character from `r`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = decode_string(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def decode_string(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    r = unique_chars
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-i-1] for i in range(len(r))}
    decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded
```

This corrected version ensures that each character in the encoded string `s` is replaced with its symmetric character from `r` correctly, thus decoding the string as required by the problem description.
