Output State: **`s` is a list of strings where each occurrence of `char` has been replaced with `unique_chars[j]`; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found in the strings of `s`; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is either `len(unique_chars) - 2` or `len(unique_chars) - 3`; `char` is the next character in the list `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is decremented by 1. Given that `j` was initially either `len(unique_chars) - 1` or `len(unique_chars) - 2`, after decrementing, `j` becomes `len(unique_chars) - 2` or `len(unique_chars) - 3`, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
