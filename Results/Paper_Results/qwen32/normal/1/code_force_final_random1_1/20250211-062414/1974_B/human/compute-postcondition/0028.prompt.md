You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of strings, where each string b in s consists of lowercase Latin letters and represents the encoded result of some original string s, with the total length of all strings in s not exceeding 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    i, j = 0, len(unique_chars) - 1
    for char in s:
        if char in unique_chars:
            s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
            j -= 1
        else:
            unique_chars.insert(i, char)
            i += 1
            j += 1
        
    #State: `s` is a list of strings where each character has been replaced by a character from `unique_chars` in reverse order, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of all unique characters from the original `s`, `i` is the count of new unique characters added, and `j` is -1.
    return ''.join(unique_chars)
    #The program returns a string that is the concatenation of all unique characters from the original list `s`, sorted in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a list of strings. Each string in the list consists of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a single string that contains all unique characters from the list `s`, sorted in ascending order.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string that is the concatenation of all unique characters from the original list `s`, sorted in ascending order.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
