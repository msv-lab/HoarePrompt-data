Postcondition: **`s` is a list of strings, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found in the strings of `s`, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is either `len(unique_chars) - 1` or `len(unique_chars) - 2`. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, each occurrence of `char` in `s` is replaced with `unique_chars[j]`, `i` is set to 0, and `j` is decreased by 1. If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `char` is inserted at the beginning of `unique_chars`, `i` is set to 1, and `j` is updated to the new length of `unique_chars` minus 1.**
