### Reasoning:

The program's goal is to maximize the sum of an array by performing a series of operations where each operation sets a subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of that subarray. The program uses recursion to break down the problem into smaller subarrays and applies the operations accordingly.

Let's analyze the key functions:

1. **func_1(a, l, r, ops)**:
   - This function is designed to handle the case when the subarray is reduced to a single element (`l == r`). If the element is not zero, it sets it to zero and records the operation.
   - For longer subarrays (`l != r`), it recursively processes the subarray starting from `l+1` to `r`. If the current element `a[l]` is not equal to the length of the subarray (`r - l + 1`), it sets the entire subarray to `r - l + 1` and records the operation. Then, it recursively processes the subarray again from `l+1` to `r`.

2. **func_2(a)**:
   - This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array.
   - After processing, it returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

3. **recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)**:
   - This function calculates the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - If the sum is less than or equal to the square of the length of the subarray (`(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`), it calls `func_1` to set the subarray to its MEX and records the operation.
   - If the sum is greater, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays before and after this maximum value.

4. **func_3()**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and operations, and prints them.

### Issues in the Program:
- The variable `ops` is used in `recursive_maximize_sum` but is not defined within this function. It should be passed as a parameter or defined globally.
- The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined in the provided code snippet. It seems like there might be a missing definition or a typo.
- The logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` needs to correctly compute the MEX of the subarray and apply the operations to maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program as written is not correct. The missing definitions and incorrect usage of variables suggest that the program will not execute as intended.

**Correctness: False**
