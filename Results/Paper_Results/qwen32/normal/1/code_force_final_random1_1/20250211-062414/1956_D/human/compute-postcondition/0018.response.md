Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a). `s` is the sum of the elements from index l to r (inclusive) in the list a, and s > (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1). `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist a[l:r + 1]. `pos` is the index of `mx` in the list `a`. The function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called. Additionally, `pos` is not equal to `l` and `pos` is not equal to `r`.**

Explanation: The function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called, but no changes have been made to the values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos` themselves. The only change is that the function call `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has now been executed.
