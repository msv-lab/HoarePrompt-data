### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify whether the program meets the requirements of the problem statement and produces the expected results for the given examples.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Maximizing the Sum**: The program should maximize the sum of the array elements by performing the allowed operations.
2. **Operation Constraints**: The program should not exceed the maximum allowed number of operations (5 * 10^5).
3. **Correctness of Operations**: The operations performed should correctly change the array to achieve the maximum sum.
4. **Output Format**: The output should match the format specified in the problem statement.

#### Analysis of Functions:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - This function is designed to recursively modify the array `a` within a given range `[l, r]`.
  - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is non-zero and sets it to 0, recording the operation.
  - If `l != r`, it recursively calls itself to process the subarray `[l+1, r]`.
  - If the current subarray's MEX (smallest missing non-negative integer) is not equal to `r-l+1`, it sets the entire subarray to `r-l+1` and records the operation.
  - This logic ensures that the subarray is maximized to the highest possible value without exceeding the constraints.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array.
  - It returns the sum of the modified array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

- **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
  - This function handles input and output.
  - It reads the input array, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and operations, and prints them in the required format.

- **Recursive Function (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**:
  - This function recursively divides the array into subarrays and processes each subarray to maximize its sum.
  - If the sum of a subarray is less than or equal to the square of its length, it sets the entire subarray to the length of the subarray.
  - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of this maximum element.
  - This approach ensures that the array is divided optimally to maximize the sum.

#### Verification Against Examples:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `2\n0 1`
  - Expected Output: `4 1\n1 2`
  - The program sets the entire array to 2, achieving the maximum sum of 4 with one operation.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `3\n1 3 9`
  - Expected Output: `13 0\n`
  - The initial sum is already 13, and no operations are needed.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `4\n1 100 2 1`
  - Expected Output: `105 2\n3 3\n3 4`
  - The program sets `a[3]` to 0 and then sets `a[3]` and `a[4]` to 2, achieving the maximum sum of 105 with two operations.

- **Example 4**:
  - Input: `1\n0`
  - Expected Output: `1 1\n1 1`
  - The program sets `a[1]` to 1, achieving the maximum sum of 1 with one operation.

Based on the analysis and verification against the examples, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the array while adhering to the constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
