Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`. `s` is the sum of the elements from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) in the list `a`. If `s` is equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, then `ops` includes the tuple `(l, r)` and all elements `a[i]` in the range `[l, r]` are set to `r - l + 1`. Otherwise, `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, and the maximum value `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` has been identified at index `pos`. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called.**
