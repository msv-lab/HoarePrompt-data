Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis of the Code

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, l, r, ops)`
- This function seems to be designed to handle the case when the subarray from index `l` to `r` needs to be modified to maximize the sum.
- If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not zero. If not, it sets `a[l]` to zero and records the operation.
- For the general case (`l < r`), it recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`. After returning from the recursion, it checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1` (which is the MEX of the subarray). If not, it sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
- However, the logic here seems flawed because it doesn't correctly compute the MEX of the subarray and directly assigns `r - l + 1` without ensuring that it is indeed the smallest missing non-negative integer.

#### Function 2: `func_2(a)`
- This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array.
- It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

#### Function 3: `recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`
- This function is supposed to recursively maximize the sum of the subarray from index `l` to `r`.
- It calculates the sum of the subarray and checks if it is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If true, it calls `func_1` to modify the subarray and sets all elements to `r - l + 1`.
- Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of the maximum element.
- The issue here is that the condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is not a reliable way to determine whether the subarray needs modification. Also, `func_1` is called incorrectly since it expects `ops` to be passed as an argument.

#### Function 4: `func_3()`
- This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.

### Issues Identified
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The functions do not correctly calculate the MEX of a subarray. They simply assign `r - l + 1` to the subarray, which is not necessarily the smallest missing non-negative integer.
2. **Incorrect Use of `ops`**: The `ops` list is not properly passed to `recursive_maximize_sum`, leading to undefined behavior.
3. **Flawed Logic for Maximizing Sum**: The logic used to decide whether to modify a subarray and how to do it is flawed and does not guarantee the maximum possible sum.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
