### Reasoning

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, l, r, ops)`
- **Purpose**: To handle the case when the subarray from index `l` to `r` needs to be modified to maximize the sum.
- **Logic**:
  - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not zero. If not, it sets `a[l]` to zero and records the operation.
  - For the general case (`l < r`), it recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`. After returning from the recursion, it checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If not, it sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
- **Annotations**:
  - The annotations suggest that `func_1` modifies the subarray to set all elements to `r - l + 1` if they are not already equal to this value.
- **Issues**:
  - The main issue is that `r - l + 1` is not necessarily the MEX of the subarray. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, which may not be `r - l + 1`.
  - The annotations do not mention the incorrect assumption about the MEX, but they do reflect the logic of setting the subarray to `r - l + 1`.

#### Function 2: `func_2(a)`
- **Purpose**: To initialize the operations list and call `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array.
- **Logic**:
  - Initializes `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum`.
  - Returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
- **Annotations**:
  - The annotations indicate that `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum` and returns the required values.
- **Issues**:
  - The annotations do not highlight any issues with `func_2` itself, but they rely on the correctness of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

#### Function 3: `recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`
- **Purpose**: To recursively maximize the sum of the subarray from index `l` to `r`.
- **Logic**:
  - Calculates the sum of the subarray and checks if it is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If true, it calls `func_1` to modify the subarray and sets all elements to `r - l + 1`.
  - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of the maximum element.
- **Annotations**:
  - The annotations reflect the logic of checking the sum and calling `func_1` or recursively processing subarrays.
- **Issues**:
  - The condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is not a reliable way to determine whether the subarray needs modification.
  - The annotations do not mention the incorrect assumption about the MEX or the flawed logic for maximizing the sum.

#### Function 4: `func_3()`
- **Purpose**: To read the input, call `func_2` to get the result, and print the sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.
- **Logic**:
  - Reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results.
- **Annotations**:
  - The annotations indicate that `func_3` reads the input, processes it, and prints the results.
- **Issues**:
  - The annotations do not highlight any issues with `func_3` itself, but they rely on the correctness of `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum`.

### Conclusion
The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the program:
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The functions do not correctly calculate the MEX of a subarray. They simply assign `r - l + 1` to the subarray, which is not necessarily the smallest missing non-negative integer.
2. **Incorrect Use of `ops`**: The `ops` list is not properly passed to `recursive_maximize_sum`, leading to undefined behavior.
3. **Flawed Logic for Maximizing Sum**: The logic used to decide whether to modify a subarray and how to do it is flawed and does not guarantee the maximum possible sum.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
