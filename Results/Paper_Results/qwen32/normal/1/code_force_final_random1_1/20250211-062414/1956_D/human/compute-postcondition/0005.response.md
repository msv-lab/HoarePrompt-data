To determine what will be printed by the `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and see if we can derive the values of `l` and `r`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`a`**: This is a list of integers.
2. **`n`**: This is an input integer.
3. **`s`, `m`, and `ops`**: These are values returned by the function `func_2(a)`. 
   - `ops` is specifically mentioned to contain at least one tuple.

### Key Points:
- The exact contents of `a` and the value of `n` are not provided.
- The function `func_2(a)` returns three values: `s`, `m`, and `ops`.
- `ops` contains at least one tuple, but the structure and contents of this tuple are not specified.
- The variables `l` and `r` are not explicitly defined in the given initial state.

### Analysis:
Given the information provided, we cannot directly determine the values of `l` and `r` because they are not defined in the initial state or in the provided code snippet. However, we can make an educated guess based on common programming practices and typical function behaviors.

#### Common Practices:
- Functions often return multiple values that are used in subsequent operations.
- If `ops` contains tuples, it might be used in a loop or conditional statements to derive other variables like `l` and `r`.

Since `l` and `r` are not defined in the given context, we can assume they are derived from `ops` or other parts of the program that are not shown here. For the purpose of this task, we need to express the output in terms of `l` and `r` as they are.

### Conclusion:
The `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement will print the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`. Since `l` and `r` are not explicitly defined in the given initial state, we describe them as variables derived from the function `func_2(a)` and the operations involving `ops`.

Output: **l + 1, r + 1 (where l and r are variables derived from the function `func_2(a)` and the operations involving `ops`)**
