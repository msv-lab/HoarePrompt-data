Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that prevent it from meeting the problem's requirements. Let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_2`**: This function calls `recursive_maximize_sum` but does not pass the `ops` list to it. This means that the operations performed in `recursive_maximize_sum` will not be recorded.

2. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**: This function is supposed to recursively maximize the sum of the array segment from index `l` to `r`. However, it uses a local variable `s` to store the sum of the segment, which is unnecessary and does not affect the global state of the array `a`. Additionally, it attempts to modify the `ops` list directly, but `ops` is not passed as an argument to the function, leading to a `NameError`.

3. **Function `func_1`**: This function is intended to perform operations to maximize the sum of the array segment from index `l` to `r`. However, it incorrectly modifies the array elements to `0` when `l == r` and `a[l] != 0`, which contradicts the goal of maximizing the sum. Furthermore, it incorrectly sets all elements in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1` without considering the MEX value.

4. **Overall Logic**: The overall logic of the program is flawed because it does not correctly calculate the MEX value for any segment of the array. Instead, it uses heuristics like setting elements to `r - l + 1`, which does not guarantee the maximum possible sum.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
3
1 3 9
```

**Expected Output:**
```
13 0
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will likely produce incorrect results due to the issues mentioned above.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality and thus is incorrect.
