### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that the program meets the problem's requirements. Specifically, the program should maximize the sum of the array `a` by performing the allowed operations and should output the maximum sum along with the sequence of operations.

Let's analyze the provided functions step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to modify the array `a` within the range `[l, r]` by setting the subarray to a specific value if necessary.
   - It recursively calls itself with the next index (`l + 1`) until `l == r`.
   - If `a[l]` is not `0`, it sets `a[l]` to `0` and records the operation.
   - After the recursive call, it checks if the current element `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If not, it sets the entire subarray from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
   - However, there is a logical flaw here. The function does not correctly compute the MEX value for the subarray and instead uses `r - l + 1` as the target value. This is incorrect because the MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes the list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array.
   - It returns the sum of the modified array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - The function seems to rely on `recursive_maximize_sum` to correctly modify the array and record operations.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function is intended to maximize the sum of the array by potentially replacing segments with a constant value.
   - It calculates the sum of the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`.
   - If the sum is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it calls `func_1` and sets the subarray to `r - l + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and splits the array into two parts around this maximum value, recursively calling itself on these parts.
   - Similar to `func_1`, this function does not correctly compute the MEX value for the subarray. Instead, it uses `r - l + 1` as the target value, which is incorrect.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, processes the array using `func_2`, and prints the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.
   - The function is correctly structured to read input, process it, and produce the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The primary issue with the program lies in the incorrect computation of the MEX value. Both `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` use `r - l + 1` as the target value instead of computing the actual MEX value of the subarray. This results in incorrect modifications of the array and, consequently, an incorrect maximum sum.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem's requirements.
