Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Undefined Variables**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` uses the variable `a` and `ops` without defining them within its scope. These variables should be passed as arguments to the function.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**: The logic in `func_1` seems flawed. Specifically, the condition `if a[l] != r - l + 1:` might not always be the correct way to determine whether an operation should be performed. The MEX value should be calculated based on the current subarray, not just the length of the subarray.

3. **Incorrect Logic in `recursive_maximize_sum`**: The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):` is not a reliable way to decide whether to perform an operation. The MEX value should be calculated, and if it's greater than the current maximum value in the subarray, then an operation should be performed to set all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.

4. **Unnecessary Operations**: The program might perform unnecessary operations because it doesn't correctly identify when an operation is needed.

5. **Incorrect Output Handling**: The operations are being printed with indices starting from 1, which is correct, but the operations themselves might not be optimal or even correct.

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly calculate the MEX value for each subarray and perform operations based on that value. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def mex(subarray):
    mex_value = 0
    while mex_value in subarray:
        mex_value += 1
    return mex_value

def maximize_sum(a, l, r, ops):
    if l > r:
        return
    subarray = a[l:r+1]
    current_mex = mex(subarray)
    if current_mex > max(subarray):
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = current_mex
    else:
        max_value = max(subarray)
        max_pos = subarray.index(max_value) + l
        if max_pos > l:
            maximize_sum(a, l, max_pos - 1, ops)
        if max_pos < r:
            maximize_sum(a, max_pos + 1, r, ops)

def main():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ops = []
    maximize_sum(a, 0, n - 1, ops)
    print(sum(a), len(ops))
    for l, r in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)

main()
```

This corrected version calculates the MEX value for each subarray and performs operations only when necessary. It also ensures that the operations are recorded and printed correctly.
