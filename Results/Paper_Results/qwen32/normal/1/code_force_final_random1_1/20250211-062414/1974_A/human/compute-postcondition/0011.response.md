The value of `z` is updated to `(y + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `z`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are the integers read from the input, `a` is greater than 0, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, `m` is an integer equal to 15 * z - 4 * y, `i` is incremented by 1**.
