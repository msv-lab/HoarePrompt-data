#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of rows (N) in the field such that 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd, b is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field such that 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns a tuple where the first element is the sum of `a` and `b`, and the second element is twice the value of `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are tuples. It returns a tuple where the first element is the sum of the first elements of `a` and `b`, and the second element is the sum of the second elements of `a` and `b`.
