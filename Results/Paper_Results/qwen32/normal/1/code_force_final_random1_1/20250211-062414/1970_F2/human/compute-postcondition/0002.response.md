Given the initial state, we know:
- `a` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, inclusive.
- `b` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, inclusive.
- `x` is equal to `a`.
- `y` is equal to `b`.
- `dx` is equal to `b`.
- `dy` is equal to `b`.

The code snippet returns the tuple `(x + dx, y + dy)`. Substituting the known values, we get `(a + b, b + b)` which simplifies to `(a + b, 2b)`.

Output State: **The program returns a tuple where the first element is the sum of `a` and `b`, and the second element is twice the value of `b`.**
