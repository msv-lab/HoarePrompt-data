To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1()` does. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine its exact impact on the variables. However, based on the given initial state and the call to `func_1()`, we can infer that `t` remains unchanged unless `func_1()` modifies it.

Given that `func_1()` is called without any parameters and its definition is not provided, we assume that `func_1()` does not modify `t` unless explicitly stated otherwise. Therefore, the value of `t` remains the same.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.**
