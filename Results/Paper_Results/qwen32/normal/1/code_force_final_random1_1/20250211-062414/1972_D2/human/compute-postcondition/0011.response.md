To determine the new value of `cnt`, we need to evaluate the expression `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` using the given initial state.

Given:
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `m` must be at least 6.
- `x` is 1.
- `y` is 2.
- `cnt` is the smaller of `n / 2` and `m // 2` if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1.

First, let's compute the gcd of `x` and `y`. Since `x` is 1 and `y` is 2, their gcd is 1. Therefore, the initial value of `cnt` is the smaller of `n / 2` and `m // 2`.

Next, we evaluate the expression `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`:

- `x + y` equals `1 + 2` which is `3`.
- `(x + y) * x` equals `3 * 1` which is `3`.
- `(x + y) * y` equals `3 * 2` which is `6`.
- `n / ((x + y) * x)` equals `n / 3`.
- `m // ((x + y) * y)` equals `m // 6`.

Thus, the expression `min(n / 3, m // 6)` needs to be evaluated.

Since `n` is at least 3 and `m` is at least 6, the minimum value of `n / 3` is `1` (when `n` is exactly 3) and the minimum value of `m // 6` is `1` (when `m` is exactly 6). However, without specific values for `n` and `m`, we can only express the updated `cnt` in terms of `n` and `m`.

The new value of `cnt` is the old value of `cnt` plus the minimum of `n / 3` and `m // 6`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is the smaller of `n / 2` and `m // 2` plus the minimum of `n / 3` and `m // 6`.**
