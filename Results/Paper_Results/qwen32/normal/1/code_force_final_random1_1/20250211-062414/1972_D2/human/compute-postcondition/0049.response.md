To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m
```

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be at least 15
- `m` is at least 15
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 3
- `cnt` is 4 if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains 3.

Let's substitute the values of `x` and `y` into the loop condition:
- `(x + y) * x = (3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18`
- `(x + y) * y = (3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18`

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true:
1. `18 <= n`
2. `18 <= m`

Since `n` must be at least 15 and `m` is at least 15, these values need to be adjusted to at least 18 to satisfy the loop condition.

No other variables (`x`, `y`, `cnt`) need to be adjusted because they do not appear directly in the loop condition.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` must be at least 18, `m` must be at least 18, `x` is 3, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is 4 if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains 3**
