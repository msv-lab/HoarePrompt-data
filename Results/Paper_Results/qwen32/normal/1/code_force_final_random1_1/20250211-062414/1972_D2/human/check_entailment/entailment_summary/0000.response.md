### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to see if it meets the requirements.

#### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**: This function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, then calculates the number of valid pairs \((x, y)\) under certain conditions.
  - It iterates over possible values of `x` starting from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
  - For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1, checking the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
  - If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, it increments the count by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
  - Finally, it prints the count of valid pairs.

- **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Key Points to Consider:
- The main logic lies in `func_1`. We need to verify if the logic correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) according to the problem statement.
- The condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` needs to be satisfied for a pair to be counted.
- The provided code seems to be counting pairs \((x, y)\) where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and certain conditions are met, but it does not directly check the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.

#### Issues in the Provided Code:
- The provided code does not directly implement the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`. Instead, it uses a different approach involving `gcd(x, y) == 1` and some derived conditions.
- The logic in `func_1` seems to be an attempt to optimize the solution by reducing the number of iterations, but it does not align with the direct interpretation of the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Given that the provided code does not directly implement the required condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` and instead uses a different approach that may not be equivalent, we cannot confirm that the program is correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
