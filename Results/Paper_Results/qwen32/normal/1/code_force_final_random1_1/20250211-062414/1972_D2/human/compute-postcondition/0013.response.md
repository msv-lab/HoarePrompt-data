The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `y` is 2, so after the increment, `y` becomes 3. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is the smaller of `n / 2` and `m // 2` plus the minimum of `n / 3` and `m // 6` if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains the smaller of `n / 2` and `m // 2`.**
