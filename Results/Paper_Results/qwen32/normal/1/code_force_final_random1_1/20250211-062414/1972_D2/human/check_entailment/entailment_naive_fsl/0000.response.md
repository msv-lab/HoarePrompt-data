Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop Conditions and Logic**: The main issue lies in the `func_1` function. The loop conditions and the logic inside the loops do not correctly iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check whether they satisfy the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Count**: The count is calculated incorrectly using `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`. This formula does not accurately count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition.

3. **Handling of GCD Condition**: The condition `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:` checks only for coprime pairs `(x, y)`, which is not sufficient to cover all valid pairs `(a, b)`.

4. **Loop Boundaries**: The loops do not cover all possible values of `a` and `b` within their respective ranges. Specifically, the loop boundaries and the way `x` and `y` are incremented do not ensure that all pairs `(a, b)` are checked.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The only valid pair `(a, b)` is `(2, 3)` because `3 * gcd(2, 3) = 3 * 1 = 3` is a multiple of `2 + 3 = 5`. However, the provided program does not correctly identify this pair.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect. A correct implementation would need to properly iterate through all pairs `(a, b)` and check the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` for each pair.
