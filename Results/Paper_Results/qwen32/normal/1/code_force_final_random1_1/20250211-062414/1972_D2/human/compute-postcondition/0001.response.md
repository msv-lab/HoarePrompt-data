In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate over the range specified by `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`.

Since `t` is already described as an input integer representing the number of test cases with the constraint `1 <= t <= 10^4`, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself to ensure the loop executes. The loop will execute `t` times as long as `t` is within the specified range.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute, given the constraints on `t`.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
