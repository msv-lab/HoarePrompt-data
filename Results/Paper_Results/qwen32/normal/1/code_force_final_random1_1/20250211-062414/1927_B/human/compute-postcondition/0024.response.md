To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `j` and `l`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1.
- `l` must be greater than the current value of `j` + 1.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Variable `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

2. **Variable `l`:**
   - The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `l` must be greater than `j + 1`. Since `j` has already been incremented, we need to ensure that `l` remains greater than this new value of `j`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value, say `j_prev`.
- After incrementing `j`, `j` becomes `j_prev + 1`.
- For the loop to execute again, `l` must be greater than `j_prev + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `l > j_prev + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` must be greater than `j + 1`; `array` is a new list of integers read from input; `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']; `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`; `ans` is a list with two additional lowercase letters, the last of which is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`; `j` is incremented by 1**

Since `j` has been incremented by 1, the new state for `j` is `j + 1` from the previous state. And `l` must still satisfy the condition `l > j + 1`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` must be greater than `j + 1`; `array` is a new list of integers read from input; `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']; `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`; `ans` is a list with two additional lowercase letters, the last of which is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`; `j` is `j + 1`**
