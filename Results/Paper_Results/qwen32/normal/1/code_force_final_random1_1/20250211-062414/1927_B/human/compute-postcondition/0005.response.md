The code snippet initializes an empty list named `ans`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `l`, `array`, `alp`, or `rev_array`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is an input integer; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters; `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`; `ans` is an empty list.**
