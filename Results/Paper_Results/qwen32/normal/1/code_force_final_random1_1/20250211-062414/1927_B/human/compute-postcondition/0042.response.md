Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; l is the length of the input list array; array is a new list of integers read from input; rev_array is the reverse of the new array; alp is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters; ans contains l characters where each character is alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1] for j from 0 to l-1; i is equal to t; j is l-1.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, we have processed `t` test cases. For each test case, we have:
- Read an integer `l` which represents the length of the array.
- Read a list `array` of `l` integers.
- Created a reversed version of `array`, named `rev_array`.
- Constructed a list `ans` of `l` characters, where each character is determined by counting how many times the corresponding element appears in the remaining part of `rev_array` (starting from that element), subtracting one, and using that count as an index into the list `alp` of lowercase English letters.
- The loop variable `i` has completed all `t` iterations, so it equals `t`.
- The inner loop variable `j` has completed its last iteration for the final test case, so it equals `l-1`.
