To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its effect on the variables.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `l` must be greater than the current value of `j` + 1
- `array` is a new list of integers read from input
- `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters ['a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'z']
- `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`
- `ans` is a list with one additional lowercase letter
- `j` is incremented by 1

Code snippet:
```python
ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
```

This line of code does the following:
- It counts the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist `rev_array[j:]`.
- It subtracts 1 from this count.
- It uses this result as an index to access an element in the `alp` list.
- It appends this character to the `ans` list.

Let's denote the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` as `count_j`. Then, the character appended to `ans` is `alp[count_j - 1]`.

Thus, the updated state of `ans` will include this new character, and `j` has already been incremented by 1 before this line was executed, so no further change is needed for `j` in this context.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` must be greater than the current value of `j` + 1; `array` is a new list of integers read from input; `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']; `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`; `ans` is a list with two additional lowercase letters, the last of which is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`; `j` is incremented by 1**
