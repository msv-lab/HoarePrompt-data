To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `l`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `l-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `0` and `i` was incremented by `1`.

Since `j` is the variable being incremented in the loop, it needs to be updated to reflect the start of the next iteration. The value of `l` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `0`.
2. **Loop Head**: The loop increments `j` by `1` in each iteration.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration to start, `j` should be incremented by `1` from its current value.

Thus, `j` should be `1` at the start of the next iteration.

Variables `t`, `l`, `array`, `rev_array`, `alp`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l` must be greater than or equal to 1, `array` is a new list of integers read from input, `rev_array` is the reverse of the new `array`, `alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabet characters, `ans` contains two additional characters which are `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` and `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`, `j` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1**
