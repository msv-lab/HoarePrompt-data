To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(n):`, which means we need to ensure that `n` is set appropriately.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range is determined by `n`.
2. **Determine Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute.
3. **Adjust State**: Given that `n` is the first integer read from the input representing the number of rows, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Since `t` (the number of test cases) and the contents of the grid (`gr`) are not directly related to the execution of this specific loop, they do not need to be adjusted in this context.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input representing the number of columns, followed by n lines of m characters each, where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `gr` is an empty list**.
