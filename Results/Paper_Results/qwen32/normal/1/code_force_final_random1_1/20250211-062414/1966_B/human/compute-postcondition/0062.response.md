The only variable in the loop head is `j`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `j` currently holds its previous value and the loop runs for `j` in the range from `0` to `m-2` (since the range is `range(m - 1)`), we need to increment `j` by 1 to move to the next iteration.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- The loop condition is `for j in range(m - 1)`, meaning `j` should take values from `0` to `m-2`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` retains its previous value, so it needs to be incremented to proceed to the next iteration.
- Since `i` is equal to `n-1` and `tc` is incremented by 1, these values do not affect the loop directly.
- The conditions involving `gr`, `ans`, and `impossible` do not influence the loop control variable `j`.

Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration, we simply increment `j` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is equal to `n-1`, `j` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 'YES', `tc` is incremented by 1, and the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the character at position `j` of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1` of the first string, or the character at position `j` of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1` of the last string, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` retains its value of True.**
