Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B`. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `i` is `n-2`, `j` is `m-2`, `impossible` is True if any `gr[i][0]` is different from `gr[i+1][0]` or `gr[i][m-1]` is different from `gr[i+1][m-1]` for any `i` in the range `n-1`, otherwise `impossible` is False, and `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.**
