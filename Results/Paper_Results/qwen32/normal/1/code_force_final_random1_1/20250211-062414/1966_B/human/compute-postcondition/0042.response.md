Postcondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer greater than 1, m is an integer greater than 1, gr is a list containing n lines of m characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B', i is n-2, j is m-2, impossible is True if any gr[i][0] is different from gr[i+1][0] or gr[i][m-1] is different from gr[i+1][m-1] for any i in range(n-1), otherwise impossible is False, and ans is 'NO'.**
