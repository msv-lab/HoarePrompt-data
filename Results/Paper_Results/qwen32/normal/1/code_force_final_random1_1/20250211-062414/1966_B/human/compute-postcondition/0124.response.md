To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each an input string)
- `i` is 0 (at the start of the first iteration, it would be 0; after each iteration, it increments by 1)
- `j` is `m-2`
- `tc` is incremented by `n * (m-1)`
- `ans` is 'YES' if the first character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`, or the `m-1`-th character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the `m-1`-th character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'NO'.
- The first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`.
- `impossible` is False if the first character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`, or the `m-1`-th character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the `m-1`-th character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.

Since `i` is the variable that changes in each iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 to move to the next iteration. The variable `n` does not change within the loop.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each an input string), `i` is 1, `j` is `m-2`, `tc` is incremented by `n * (m-1)`, `ans` is 'YES' if the first character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`, or the `m-1`-th character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the `m-1`-th character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'NO', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `impossible` is False if the first character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`, or the `m-1`-th character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the `m-1`-th character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**
