### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine whether it's possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using the specified operations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid and then reads the grid itself.

2. **Initial Assumption**: The program assumes that it is possible to make all squares the same color (`ans = 'YES'`).

3. **Check Corner Colors**: It checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid have different colors. If they do, it proceeds to check if there is any variation along the top row or the bottom row, and similarly along the leftmost column and the rightmost column.

4. **Detailed Checks**:
   - If the top-left and bottom-right corners are different, the program checks if there is any variation in the top row or the bottom row. If there is no variation in either row, it sets `impossible` to `True`.
   - Similarly, it checks for variations in the leftmost and rightmost columns. If there is no variation in either column, it again sets `impossible` to `True`.

5. **Final Decision**: If `impossible` remains `True` after checking both rows and columns, it means that the only way to change the colors would be to change the entire row or column, which is not possible if there are variations within those rows or columns. Hence, it sets `ans` to `'NO'`.

6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis:

The key idea here is that if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different, and there is no variation within the top/bottom rows or left/right columns, then it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color because the middle part of the grid cannot be changed independently of the edges.

However, the program does not correctly handle all edge cases. Specifically, it fails to consider scenarios where the grid has more complex patterns that could still allow uniform coloring through a series of operations. For instance, a checkerboard pattern with alternating colors might still be reducible to a single color under certain conditions, but the current logic would incorrectly mark it as impossible.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program does not cover all possible scenarios and thus may produce incorrect results for some inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
