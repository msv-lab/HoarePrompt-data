The code appends a new input string to the list `gr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `impossible`, `ans`, and `tc` remain unchanged except for `gr` which now contains one more element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than `i`, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing three elements (the original input string, the previously appended input string, and the newly appended input string), `i` is incremented by 1, `j` retains its previous value, `impossible` retains its previous value, `ans` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by 1.**
