The code reads two integers from the input, which represent the number of rows (`n`) and columns (`m`) of a grid. These values replace the previous values of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input representing the number of rows, `m` is the second integer read from the input representing the number of columns, followed by n lines of m characters each, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
