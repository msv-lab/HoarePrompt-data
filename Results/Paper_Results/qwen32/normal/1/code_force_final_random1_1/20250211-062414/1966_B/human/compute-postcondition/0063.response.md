Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is equal to `n-1`, `j` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 'YES', `tc` is incremented by 1, and the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. `impossible` is False.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the variable `impossible` is set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
