The given code snippet only changes the value of the variable `impossible`. It sets `impossible` to `False`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first line (`gr[0][0]`) is different from the last character of the last line (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, `impossible` is False, and at least one of the following is true: `gr[0][j]` is different from `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is different from `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`.**
