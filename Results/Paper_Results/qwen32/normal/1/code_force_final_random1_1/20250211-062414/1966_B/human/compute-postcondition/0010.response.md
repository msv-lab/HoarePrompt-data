Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input representing the number of columns, `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is equal to `n`**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `gr` will be a list containing all `n` lines of `m` characters each, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'. The variable `i` will have been incremented up to `n`, reflecting that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `t` and `m` remain unchanged as they were initially set.
