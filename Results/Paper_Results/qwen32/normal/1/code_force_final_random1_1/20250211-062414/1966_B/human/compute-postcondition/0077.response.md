The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n-2` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n-1`.

Given that `i` is currently `n-1`, we need to decrement `i` to `n-2` to allow the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is equal to `n-2`, `j` is `m - 2`, `tc` is incremented by 1, and the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the first character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`, or the last character of the `i-th` string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the `(i+1)-th` string in `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True. `ans` is 'NO' in both cases.**
