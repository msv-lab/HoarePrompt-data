The code appends a new input string to the list `gr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, and `tc` remain unchanged. The only change is that `gr` now contains one more element, which is the newly appended input string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing three elements (the original string, the previously appended input string, and the newly appended input string), `i` is `n`, `j` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by 1.**
