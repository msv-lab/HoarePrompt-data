Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m - 2`, `tc` is incremented by `n-1`. If `impossible` is `True`, it indicates that at least one pair of consecutive strings in `gr` had differing first or last characters, and `ans` is 'NO'. If `impossible` is `False`, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `j`, and `tc` remain as specified, but `ans` remains unchanged as 'NO'.**
