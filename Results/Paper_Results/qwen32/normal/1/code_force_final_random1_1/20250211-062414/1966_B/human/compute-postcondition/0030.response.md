Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is equal to `n`, the first character of the first line (`gr[0][0]`) is different from the last character of the last line (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `j` is `m - 2`, `impossible` is True, `ans` is 'NO', and either `gr[i][0]` is different from `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is different from `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`.**
