To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `n`.

Given the for loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 because `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

The variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function and does not need to be set beforehand. It will take on the values from 0 to `n-1` during each iteration of the loop.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

The other variables (`t`, `m`, `gr`, `j`, `impossible`, `ans`, `tc`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is an empty list `[]`, `i` retains its previous value, `j` retains its previous value, `impossible` retains its previous value, `ans` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by 1**
