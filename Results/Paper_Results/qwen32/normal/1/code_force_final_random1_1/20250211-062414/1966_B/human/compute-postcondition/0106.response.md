To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `m`.

Given the loop:
```python
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is at least 2
- `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each an input string)
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` retains its previous value
- `tc` is incremented by `n`
- `ans` is 'YES'
- The first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`
- `impossible` is False if either the character at position `j` in the first string of `gr` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1` in the first string of `gr`, or the character at position `j` in the last string of `gr` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1` in the last string of `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.

In the loop `for j in range(m - 1):`, `j` is the loop variable that iterates from `0` to `m-2`. After each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.

Since `j` retains its previous value at the end of the previous iteration, it means that at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Therefore, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `tc`, `ans`, `impossible`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each an input string), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `j + 1` (where `j` is the value at the end of the previous iteration), `tc` is incremented by `n`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, and `impossible` is False if either the character at position `j` in the first string of `gr` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1` in the first string of `gr`, or the character at position `j` in the last string of `gr` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1` in the last string of `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**
