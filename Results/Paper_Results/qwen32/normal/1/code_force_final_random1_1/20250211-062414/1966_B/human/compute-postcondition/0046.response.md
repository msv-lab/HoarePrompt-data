The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This means that the values of `n` and `m` will be updated based on the input, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `n` and `m` were previously defined as integers greater than 0. After executing the code snippet, `n` and `m` will take on the new values provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is `n-2` if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, `j` is `m-2` if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, `impossible` is True if any `gr[i][0]` is different from `gr[i+1][0]` or `gr[i][m-1]` is different from `gr[i+1][m-1]` for any `i` in the range `n-1`, otherwise `impossible` is False, and `ans` is 'NO' if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]` or `impossible` is True, otherwise `ans` remains 'YES'. `tc` is incremented by 1.**
