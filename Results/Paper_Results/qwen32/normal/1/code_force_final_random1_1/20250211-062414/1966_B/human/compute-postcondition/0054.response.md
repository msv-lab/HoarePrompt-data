Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is equal to `n-1`, `j` retains its previous value, `impossible` retains its previous value, `ans` retains its previous value, `tc` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `gr` will contain exactly `n` input strings. The loop index `i` will have reached `n-1`, meaning it has iterated through all `n` elements. All other variables (`t`, `m`, `j`, `impossible`, `ans`, and `tc`) will retain their initial values or have been updated as per their respective rules outside the loop.
