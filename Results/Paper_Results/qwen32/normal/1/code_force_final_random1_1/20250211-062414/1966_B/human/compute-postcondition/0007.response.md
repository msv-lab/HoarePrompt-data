The code appends a new line of input to the list `gr`. This means that `gr` now contains one more element, which is the newly read line of `m` characters (each being either 'W' or 'B'). The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but since the increment operation is mentioned in the initial state and not in the code snippet, we only reflect the change caused by the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input representing the number of columns, `gr` is a list containing two lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is incremented by 1**.
