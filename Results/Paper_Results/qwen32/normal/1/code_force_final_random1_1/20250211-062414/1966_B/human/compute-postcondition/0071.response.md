Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is equal to `n-1`, `j` is `m - 2`, `tc` is incremented by 1, and the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If `impossible` is True, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` retains its value of 'YES'.**
