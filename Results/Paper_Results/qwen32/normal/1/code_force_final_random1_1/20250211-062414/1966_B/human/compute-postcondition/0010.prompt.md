Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input representing the number of rows, `m` is the second integer read from the input representing the number of columns, followed by n lines of m characters each, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `gr` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    gr.append(input())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input representing the number of columns, `gr` is a list containing one line of `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input representing the number of columns, `gr` is a list containing two lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is incremented by 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input representing the number of columns, `gr` is a list containing three lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is incremented by 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
