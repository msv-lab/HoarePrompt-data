Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input representing the number of rows, `m` is the second integer read from the input representing the number of columns, followed by n lines of m characters each, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `gr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `gr` is initialized as an empty list. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, and the grid of characters) remain unchanged.
