To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which is `i` in this case.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the description, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was equal to `n`. However, since the loop runs from `0` to `n-2` (inclusive), `i` cannot be `n` at the start of the loop. This indicates that the loop has already completed all its iterations, and the state provided might be after the loop has ended.

However, if we assume the task is to describe the state right before the loop starts, we need to set `i` to `0` because that's where the loop begins.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `i` should be `0` because the loop starts from `0`.
- Other variables like `t`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `j`, `impossible`, and `ans` do not change based on the loop head and thus remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the loop would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` lines of `m` characters where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `i` is 0, `j` is `m - 2`, `impossible` is False if either `gr[i][0]` is different from `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is different from `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, otherwise `impossible` remains True, and `ans` is 'NO'**. 

Since the condition for `impossible` depends on the initial values of `gr`, we keep it as described without changing its value.
