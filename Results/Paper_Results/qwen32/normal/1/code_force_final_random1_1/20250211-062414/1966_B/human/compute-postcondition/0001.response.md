In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of `t`, where `t` represents the number of test cases. The loop variable is `tc`, which will take values from 0 to `t-1`.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to consider the variable `t` since it directly influences the number of iterations. The variables `n`, `m`, and the grid of characters ('W' or 'B') are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to make the loop execute. They are part of the input data for each test case inside the loop.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute because `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 500, followed by n lines of m characters each, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.** 

Since the loop will execute given the constraints on `t`, no further adjustments are necessary for the loop to start executing.
