Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each being an input string), `i` is equal to `n-1`, `j` retains its previous value, `impossible` retains its previous value, `ans` is 'YES', `tc` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is set to the string `'YES'`. All other variables retain their previous values, and `tc` is incremented by 1.
