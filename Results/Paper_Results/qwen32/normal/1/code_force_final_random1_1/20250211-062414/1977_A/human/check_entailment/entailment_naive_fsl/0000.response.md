Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if it's possible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Each move consists of adding or removing exactly one cube.
- The initial number of cubes in the tower is zero.

### Key Points:
- The difference between `n` (number of moves) and `m` (desired number of cubes) must be such that we can reach `m` cubes using exactly `n` moves.
- Since each move changes the number of cubes by exactly one, the parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m` must match for it to be possible to reach `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program checks several conditions:
1. If `n == m`, it prints "Yes".
2. If `m > n`, it prints "No".
3. If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes".
4. If both `m` and `n` are even, it prints "Yes".
5. If both `m` and `n` are odd, it prints "Yes".
6. Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Issues in the Program:
- The condition `if m == n - 1: print('Yes')` is unnecessary and incorrect. It does not align with the logic that the parity of `n` and `m` must match.
- The conditions `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:` and `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:` are sufficient to cover all valid cases where `m` cubes can be achieved with `n` moves.

### Counterexample:
Consider the case where `n = 4` and `m = 2`. According to the problem description, this should be possible because we can add one cube, remove one cube, add one cube, and remove one cube again, ending up with 2 cubes. However, the program would print "No" because it doesn't account for the parity condition correctly.

### Correctness:
The program is incorrect due to the unnecessary and incorrect condition `if m == n - 1: print('Yes')`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly handles certain cases and includes unnecessary conditions that do not align with the problem description. Specifically, the condition `if m == n - 1: print('Yes')` is incorrect and leads to wrong results for some inputs. The correct approach should only check the parity of `n` and `m`.
