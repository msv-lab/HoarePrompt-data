Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

### Variables and Objects:
- `t`, `n`, and `m` are integers derived from the input, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
- `i` is set to 1, but it is also not used in the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. It will always print the string `'No'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
