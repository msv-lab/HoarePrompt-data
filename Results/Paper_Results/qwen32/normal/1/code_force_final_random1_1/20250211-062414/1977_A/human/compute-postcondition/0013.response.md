The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides several conditions and constraints about the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the content of the `print` statement itself.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` and `m` are integers with specific constraints:
  - `n` is the first integer from the input.
  - `m` is the second integer from the input.
  - `n` is not equal to `m`.
  - `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
  - `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.
  - Both `m` and `n` are even.

Despite these constraints, they do not affect the execution of the `print` statement, which simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Yes**
