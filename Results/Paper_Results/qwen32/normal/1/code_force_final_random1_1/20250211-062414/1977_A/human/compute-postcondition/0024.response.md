The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 1.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` do not change based on the loop head and the conditions provided do not affect the loop's continuation directly. They only influence the behavior inside the loop body, which is omitted here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input. If `n` is equal to `m`, they retain their original values. Otherwise, if `m` is greater than `n`, they retain their original values. If `m` is less than or equal to `n` and `m` equals `n - 1`, they retain their original values. If `m` is less than or equal to `n` and `m` does not equal `n - 1`, at least one of `m` or `n` becomes even if at least one of them is not even.**
