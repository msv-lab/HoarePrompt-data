Let's analyze the logic of the given program against the problem statement:

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move. Therefore, after `n` moves, the difference between the number of moves (`n`) and the final number of cubes (`m`) must be even because each pair of an addition and a removal operation results in no net change, and any leftover operations must be additions or removals in pairs (or just one of each if `n` is odd).

Here's the correct logic:
- If `n >= m`, then it is possible to reach `m` cubes if `n - m` is even. This is because we can perform `m` additions and `(n - m)` operations which can be paired as removals and additions, leaving us with `m` cubes.
- If `n < m`, it is impossible because we cannot create more cubes than the number of moves.

The provided program does not correctly implement this logic. Specifically:
- It incorrectly checks if `n == m` and directly prints 'Yes', which is correct but incomplete.
- It checks if `m > n` and prints 'No', which is correct.
- It checks if `m == n - 1` and prints 'Yes', which is incorrect. It should check if `n - m` is even.
- It checks if both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd and prints 'Yes', which is also incorrect. This does not cover all valid cases where `n - m` is even.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

Given these observations, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
