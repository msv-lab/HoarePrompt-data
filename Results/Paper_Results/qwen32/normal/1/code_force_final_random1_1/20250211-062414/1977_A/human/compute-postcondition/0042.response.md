The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`), but these variables are not used within the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.

Since the `print` statement is simply `print('Yes')`, it will output the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`.

Output: **Yes**
