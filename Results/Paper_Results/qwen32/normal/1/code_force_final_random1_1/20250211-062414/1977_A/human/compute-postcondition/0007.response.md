The initial state provides us with several variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` and `m` are integers where `n` is not equal to `m` and `m` is greater than `n`.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **No**
