Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, and `n` is not equal to `m`. If `m` is greater than `n`, then `m` and `n` retain their original values. If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `m` equals `n - 1`, then `m` and `n` retain their original values. If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `m` does not equal `n - 1`, then at least one of `m` or `n` becomes even if at least one of them is not even.**
