Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- It is specified that `n` is equal to `m`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. The statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
