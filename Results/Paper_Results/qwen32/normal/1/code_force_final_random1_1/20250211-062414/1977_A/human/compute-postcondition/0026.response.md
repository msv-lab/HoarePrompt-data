In this task, the initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`, but the `print` statement only contains the string `'Yes'`. This means that the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` and `m` are integers derived from the input, but they are not used in the `print` statement.

Given this, the `print` statement will simply output the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
