In the given initial state, the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` are described with specific constraints or roles. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not reference any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable Descriptions**:
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `i`: Set to the integer value 2.
   - `n`: The first integer from the input.
   - `m`: The second integer from the input.

2. **Print Statement Analysis**:
   - The `print('Yes')` statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'` without referencing any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`.

Output: **Yes**
