The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This means the values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the input, while the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` and `m` are reassigned to the new values read from the input.
- `t` and `i` retain their original values.

The conditions related to the values of `n` and `m` (whether they are equal, whether `m` is greater than `n`, etc.) are not affected by the code snippet itself, as these conditions are only described and not enforced or altered by the provided code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input.**
