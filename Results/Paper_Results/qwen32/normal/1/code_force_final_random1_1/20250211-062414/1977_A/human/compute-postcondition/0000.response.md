The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means `t` will now hold the specific integer value provided by the user, which is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The initial state mentioned that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and this condition remains valid after the code execution. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.**
