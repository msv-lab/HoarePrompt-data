Given the initial state, we have several variables defined with specific constraints:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `i` is set to 0.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, with the following conditions:
  - `n` is not equal to `m`.
  - `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
  - `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.
  - Both `m` and `n` are odd numbers.

The Python code snippet provided is simply:

```python
print('Yes')
```

This print statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. It directly prints the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **Yes**
