To determine what will be printed by the statement `print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))`, let's break down the components involved:

1. **`time`**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state provided. However, based on the context, it likely represents the current time or turn number in the game. Since it is used in the print statement, we can assume it holds an integer value representing the current time/turn.

2. **`player`**: This variable is determined based on the following logic:
   - If `obj` (the first element of `command`) is a player, then `player` is set to `obj`.
   - Otherwise, `player` is set to the element at the new position `nxt` in the grid.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `obj` is the first element of `command`.
- `nxt` is the new position tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, where `pos` is the current position of `obj` in the grid, and `mov[com]` provides the movement vector based on the command `com`.

Since the exact values of `time`, `obj`, `com`, and the grid configuration are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:
- The current `time` (an integer).
- The `player` (either `obj` if `obj` is a player, or the element at the new position `nxt` in the grid).

Output: **time player ELIMINATED (where time is the current time/turn and player is either obj if obj is a player, or the element at the new position nxt in the grid)**
