The only variable in the loop head is `ind`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `ind` and the length of `line`. If `ind` is less than the length of `line`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `ind` was some value, let's call it `x`, such that `x < len(line)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `x + 1`.

Given that `line` must have at least one element, and assuming `ind` was previously `x`, the new state should reflect `ind` being `x + 1`. However, since we don't know the exact value of `x`, we can generalize this by saying `ind` is now `ind + 1`.

State: **`line` must have at least one element. If the element at index `ind` is not '..', then `elements[line[ind]]` is `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is a player, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. If `line[ind]` is not a player and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is either 0 or 1 and `goal[tmp]` includes the additional element `(i, ind)`. `ind` is `ind + 1`**
