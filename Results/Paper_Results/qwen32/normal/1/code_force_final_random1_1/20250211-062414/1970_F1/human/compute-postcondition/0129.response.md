To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `time`: This variable holds the current time value, but its exact value is not specified in the initial state.
   - `GoalName`: This is a list (or similar data structure) that maps team indices (0 or 1) to their respective goal names. Since the exact values are not provided, we'll refer to it as `GoalName[team]`.
   - `team`: This variable holds either 0 or 1, indicating which team's goal position `pos` corresponds to. The exact value is not specified but is determined based on the position `pos`.

2. **Contextual Information:**
   - The `print` statement is part of a larger logic where a player (`obj`) moves to a new position (`nxt`) and reaches a goal position (`pos`).
   - The function `goalIn(pos)` returns a value indicating which team's goal position `pos` corresponds to, and this value is used to set `team`.
   - The `print` statement formats the output to include the current time (`time`), the goal name corresponding to the team (`GoalName[team]`), and the word "GOAL".

Given these details, the `print` statement will output the current time followed by the goal name of the team that scored, and the word "GOAL".

Therefore, the output will be formatted as:
Output: **time GoalName[team] GOAL (where time is the current time and GoalName[team] is the goal name of the team that scored)**

However, since we don't have the exact values of `time` and `GoalName[team]`, we can only describe them in terms of the variables:

Output: **time GoalName[team] GOAL**
