Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each being a list of strings (`line`); `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' string in any `line` to its position `(i, ind)` for all `i` in `range(n)` and `ind` in `range(len(line))`, with `elements[obj]` updated to `nxt` if `obj` is a player and `com` is not 'T'. If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is specifically set to `False` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1 if `pos` is a goal position; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player in any `line` to `False`; `goal` is a list of two lists where each list contains tuples `(i, ind)` for goals of the respective team; `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0] with `points[team]` incremented by 1 if `pos` is a goal position and `com` is 'T'; `line` is the last read list of strings from input, `elements` maps each non-'..' string in `line` to its position `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers` maps each player in `line` to `False`, `goal` includes tuples for all goal markers in `line`, categorized by team; `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `command` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the stripped input line, and the length of `command` is not equal to 3; `obj` is the first element of `command`; `com` is the second element of `command`; `pos` is the position tuple `(i, ind)` of `obj` in the grid; `nxt` is the new position tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. Additionally, either `obj` is not '.B' or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is not a player, and if `obj` is a player, then `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`.**
