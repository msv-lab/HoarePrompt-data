Postcondition: **`line` must have at least `ind + 2` elements, `ind` is `ind + 1`, `elements[line[ind]]` is `(i, ind)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. Otherwise, if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` includes the additional element `(i, ind)`**.
