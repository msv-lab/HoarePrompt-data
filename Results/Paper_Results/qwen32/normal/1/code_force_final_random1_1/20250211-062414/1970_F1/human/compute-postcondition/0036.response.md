Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`; `elements` is a dictionary with the values {'B': (-1, -1)}. If `line[1]` is not '..', `elements` includes `line[1]` with the value (i, 1). If `line[2]` is not '..', `elements` also includes `line[2]` with the value (i, 2). If `isPlayer(line[1])` is True, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the value `{line[1]: False}`. If `isPlayer(line[2])` is True and `line[1]` is also a player, `allPlayers` includes `line[2]: False`. If `isPlayer(line[1])` is False and the second character of `line[1]` is 'G', `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, 1)`. If `isPlayer(line[2])` is False and the second character of `line[2]` is 'G', `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, 2)`. If `isPlayer(line[1])` is False and the second character of `line[1]` is not 'G', `goal` remains a list of two empty lists. If `isPlayer(line[2])` is False and the second character of `line[2]` is not 'G', `goal` remains unchanged. `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings with at least one string; `ind` is 2.**
