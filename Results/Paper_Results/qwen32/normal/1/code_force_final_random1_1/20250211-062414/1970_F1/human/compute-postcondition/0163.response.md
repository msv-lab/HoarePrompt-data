Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each being a list of strings (`line`). If `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `points` is a list of two integers where one of the integers is incremented by 1, and `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`. If `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is -1, `points` remains unchanged. If `com` is not 'T' and `obj` is a player, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' string in any `line` to its position `(i, ind)` for all `i` in `range(n)` and `ind` in `range(len(line))`. `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. `goal` is a list of two lists where each list contains tuples `(i, ind)` for goals of the respective team. `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0] unless modified as described. `line` is the last read list of strings from input. `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. `command` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the stripped input line. `time` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `obj` is the first element of `command`. `com` is the second element of `command`. `pos` is the position of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary. `nxt` is the new position calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is not a player and `com` is not 'T', none of these variables are modified.**
