The only object in the loop head is the variable `ind`. The loop iterates over the indices of the `line` list. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `ind` by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd.
- `grid` is a list containing two elements, each being a list of strings (`line`).
- `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' string in `line` to its position `(i, ind)`, with `elements[line[ind]]` updated to `(3, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not '..'.
- `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player in `line` to `False`.
- `goal` is a list of two lists where each list contains tuples `(i, ind)` for goals of the respective team, with `goal[tmp]` including `(3, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G'.
- `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0].
- `line` is a list of strings obtained from `stdin.readline().strip().split()` and must have at least one element.
- `i` is 3.
- `ind` is the current index being processed in the loop.

Since `ind` is the loop variable, it should be incremented by 1 to move to the next element in `line`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing two elements, each being a list of strings (`line`); `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' string in `line` to its position `(i, ind)`, with `elements[line[ind]]` updated to `(3, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not '..'; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player in `line` to `False`; `goal` is a list of two lists where each list contains tuples `(i, ind)` for goals of the respective team, with `goal[tmp]` including `(3, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G'; `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings obtained from `stdin.readline().strip().split()` and must have at least one element; `i` is 3; `ind` is 4**.
