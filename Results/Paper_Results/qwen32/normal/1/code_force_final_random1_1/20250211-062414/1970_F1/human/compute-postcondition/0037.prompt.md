Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are integers read from input such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both n and m are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`; `elements` is a dictionary mapping strings to tuples of integers representing the positions of entities on the field, and now `elements` is {'B': (-1, -1)}; `allPlayers` is a dictionary (now empty); `goal` is a list of two empty lists; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the red and blue teams respectively, and now `points` is [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line of input.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`; `elements` is a dictionary with the values {'B': (-1, -1)}. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements` includes `line[ind]` with the value (i, ind). If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the value `{line[ind]: False}`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', `goal` is a list of two lists where one list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` and the other remains empty. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False and the second character of `line[ind]` is not 'G', `goal` remains a list of two empty lists. Additionally, if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` is 1. `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings with at least one string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`; `elements` is a dictionary with the values {'B': (-1, -1)}, and if `line[1]` is not '..', `elements` also includes `line[1]` with the value (i, 1). If `isPlayer(line[1])` is True, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the value `{line[1]: False}`. If `isPlayer(line[1])` is False and the second character of `line[1]` is 'G', `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, 1)`. If `isPlayer(line[1])` is False and the second character of `line[1]` is not 'G', `goal` remains a list of two empty lists. Additionally, if `line[1][0]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` is 1. `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings with at least one string; `ind` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`; `elements` is a dictionary with the values {'B': (-1, -1)}. If `line[1]` is not '..', `elements` includes `line[1]` with the value (i, 1). If `line[2]` is not '..', `elements` also includes `line[2]` with the value (i, 2). If `isPlayer(line[1])` is True, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the value `{line[1]: False}`. If `isPlayer(line[2])` is True and `line[1]` is also a player, `allPlayers` includes `line[2]: False`. If `isPlayer(line[1])` is False and the second character of `line[1]` is 'G', `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, 1)`. If `isPlayer(line[2])` is False and the second character of `line[2]` is 'G', `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, 2)`. If `isPlayer(line[1])` is False and the second character of `line[1]` is not 'G', `goal` remains a list of two empty lists. If `isPlayer(line[2])` is False and the second character of `line[2]` is not 'G', `goal` remains unchanged. `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings with at least one string; `ind` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
