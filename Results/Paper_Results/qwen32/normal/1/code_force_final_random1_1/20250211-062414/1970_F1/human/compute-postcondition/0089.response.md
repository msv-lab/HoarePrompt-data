The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. This means that the list `goal[tmp]` now includes an additional element which is the tuple `(i, ind)`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged except for the updated `goal[tmp]`.

Output State: **`line` must have at least one element. If the element at index `ind` is not '..', then `elements[line[ind]]` is `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is a player, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. If `line[ind]` is not a player and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is either 0 or 1 and `goal[tmp]` includes the additional element `(i, ind)`. `ind` is `ind + 1`. `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to `(i, ind)`. `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. `goal[tmp]` includes the additional element `(i, ind)`.**
