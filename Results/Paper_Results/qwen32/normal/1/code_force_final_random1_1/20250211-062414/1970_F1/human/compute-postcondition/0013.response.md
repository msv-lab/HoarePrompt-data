Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`; `elements` is a dictionary with the values {'B': (-1, -1), `line[ind]`: (i, ind)}; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the value `{line[ind]: False}`; `goal` is a list of two empty lists; `points` is a list of two integers [0, 0]; `line` is a list of strings with at least one string; the current element at index `ind` in `line` is not '..' and `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True.** 

Explanation: The value of `allPlayers` is updated to include the key `line[ind]` with the value `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.
