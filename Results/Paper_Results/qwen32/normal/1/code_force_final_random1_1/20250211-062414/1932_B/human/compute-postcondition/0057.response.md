To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given Python code snippet in the context of the initial state provided.

Given:
- `test_cases` contains at least three test cases.
- `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21.
- `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`.
- `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`.
- `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least two elements.
- `current_year` is set to the value of `next_year`.
- `ai` is the second element in `a`.

Code snippet:
```python
next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
```

From the code snippet, `next_year` is being recalculated based on the current value of `current_year` and `ai`. Since `current_year` was previously set to the value of `next_year`, we can denote the old value of `next_year` as `old_next_year`. Thus, `current_year` is `old_next_year`.

Let's denote `ai` as `a[1]` since it is the second element in the list `a`.

The new value of `next_year` is calculated as:
\[ \text{new\_next\_year} = (\text{old\_next\_year} // \text{a[1]} + 1) * \text{a[1]} \]

This means `next_year` is now updated to the smallest multiple of `a[1]` that is greater than `old_next_year`.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least three test cases; `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21; `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`; `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least two elements; `current_year` is set to the value of `old_next_year`; `ai` is the second element in `a`; `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[1]` that is greater than `old_next_year`.**
