The provided code snippet only contains the assignment `current_year = next_year`. This means that the value of `current_year` is being updated to the value of `next_year`. No other operations are performed in the given code, so no other variables are affected.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` contains at least three test cases.
- `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21.
- `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`.
- `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`.
- `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least two elements.
- `current_year` is set to the value of `next_year`.
- `ai` is the third element in `a`.
- If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is set to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is set to the smallest multiple of `a[1]` that is greater than the old `next_year`.

Since the only operation in the code is `current_year = next_year`, the value of `current_year` will now be the same as `next_year`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least three test cases; `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21; `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`; `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least two elements; `current_year` is set to the value of `next_year`; `ai` is the third element in `a`.**
