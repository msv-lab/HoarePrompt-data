The only variable in the loop head is `ai`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will continue as long as there are more elements in the list `a` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `ai` was the second element in `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ai` should now be the next element in `a`.

Given that `a` must contain at least two elements, and `ai` was the second element in the last iteration, the next element in `a` would be the third element (if it exists).

Therefore, `ai` should be updated to the third element in `a`.

State: **`test_cases` contains at least three test cases; `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21; `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`; `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least two elements; `current_year` is set to the value of `next_year`; `ai` is the third element in `a`. If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is set to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is set to the smallest multiple of `a[1]` that is greater than `old_next_year`.**
