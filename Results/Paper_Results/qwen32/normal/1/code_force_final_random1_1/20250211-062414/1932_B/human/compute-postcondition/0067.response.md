To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop processes each test case individually, calculating a `current_year` which is essentially the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a` for each test case. This `current_year` is then appended to the `results` list.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is the total number of test cases.
   - `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers.
   - `results` is initially an empty list.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case `(n, a)`, initialize `current_year` to 0.
   - For each integer `ai` in the list `a`, calculate the next year (`next_year`) based on whether `current_year` is divisible by `ai`.
     - If `current_year % ai == 0`, then `next_year = current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, `next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - Update `current_year` to `next_year`.
   - After processing all integers in `a`, append `current_year` to the `results` list.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After all test cases are processed, `results` will contain the LCM of the integers in the list `a` for each test case.

Given the provided output states for the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop correctly calculates the LCM for each test case and appends it to the `results` list.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a` for each test case in `test_cases`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing all iterations, the `results` list will contain the LCM of the integers for each test case provided in the `test_cases` list.
