To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `a`, which is a list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases`.

Let's break down the information given:
- `test_cases` contains at least three test cases.
- `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21.
- `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`.
- `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`.
- `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases`.
- `current_year` is 0.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for ai in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element since the loop iterates over `a`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `test`, `n`, and `current_year`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution, so they don't need to be adjusted for the loop to run.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `a` contains at least one element.

State: **`test_cases` contains at least three test cases, `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21, `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least one element, `current_year` is 0**
