The code snippet assigns the value of `next_year` to `current_year`. No other variables are modified.

To determine the output state, let's summarize the relevant parts:

- `test_cases` contains at least two test cases.
- `results` is a list containing one element, 0.
- `test` is the second test case in `test_cases`.
- `n` is the integer from the second test case in `test_cases`.
- `a` is the list of integers from the second test case in `test_cases`.
- `ai` is the third element in `a`.
- `current_year` is calculated as `10 + ai` if `10 % ai == 0` else `(10 // ai + 1) * ai`.
- `next_year` is calculated based on whether `current_year % ai == 0`:
  - If `current_year % ai == 0`, `next_year` is `10 + 2 * ai` if `10 % ai == 0` else `(10 // ai + 2) * ai`.
  - Otherwise, `next_year` is `(10 // ai + 2) * ai`.

After executing `current_year = next_year`, `current_year` now holds the value of `next_year`.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least two test cases; `results` is a list containing one element, 0; `test` is the second test case in `test_cases`; `n` is the integer from the second test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the list of integers from the second test case in `test_cases`; `ai` is the third element in `a`; `current_year` is equal to `next_year`; `next_year` is calculated based on the conditions provided.**
