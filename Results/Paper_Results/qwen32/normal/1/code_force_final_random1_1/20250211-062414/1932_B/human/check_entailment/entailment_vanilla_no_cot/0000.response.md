To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens according to the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `year` to 0. This variable keeps track of the current year up to which all previous signs have occurred.
2. **Loop through each sign**: For each sign `ai` in the list `a`, the program updates the `year` by adding the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `year + 1`. This is done using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.
   - If `year % ai == 0`, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so the next occurrence of the sign is at `year + ai`. However, since we want the next occurrence strictly after `year`, we add `ai` to `year`.
   - If `year % ai != 0`, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, so the next occurrence of the sign is at the next multiple of `ai` after `year`. This is calculated as `year + (ai - year % ai)`, which simplifies to `year + ai - (year % ai)`. But because `year % ai` is non-zero, this can be written more succinctly as `year + ai - (year % ai)`, which is equivalent to `year + (ai - (year % ai))` or simply `year + ai - (year % ai)`, but the expression `year % ai or ai` achieves the same result in a more concise manner.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:
- Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- Calculation:
  - Start with `year = 0`
  - First sign (`ai = 3`): `year = 0 + (0 % 3 or 3) = 3`
  - Second sign (`ai = 2`): `year = 3 + (3 % 2 or 2) = 3 + 2 = 5`
  - Third sign (`ai = 4`): `year = 5 + (5 % 4 or 4) = 5 + 3 = 8`
  - Fourth sign (`ai = 5`): `year = 8 + (8 % 5 or 5) = 8 + 2 = 10`
  - Fifth sign (`ai = 9`): `year = 10 + (10 % 9 or 9) = 10 + 8 = 18`
  - Sixth sign (`ai = 18`): `year = 18 + (18 % 18 or 18) = 18 + 18 = 36`

The output for the first test case is `36`, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
