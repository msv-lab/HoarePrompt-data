The only object in the loop head is the variable `ai`, which iterates over the list `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `a` and how `ai` would be updated.

Given:
- `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least one element.
- The loop iterates over each element in `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ai` would have taken the value of the last element in `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `a` that `ai` can take.

Let's assume `a` has at least two elements (since it must contain at least one and we are moving to the next iteration). If `ai` was the first element in the previous iteration, it should now be the second element.

State: **`test_cases` contains at least three test cases; `results` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 21; `test` is the third test case in `test_cases`; `n` is the integer from the third test case in `test_cases`; `a` is the list of integers from the third test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least two elements; `current_year` is set to the value of `next_year`; `ai` is the second element in `a`.**
