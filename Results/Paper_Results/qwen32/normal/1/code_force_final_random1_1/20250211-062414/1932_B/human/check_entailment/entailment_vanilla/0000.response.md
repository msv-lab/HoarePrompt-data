Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find the year in which the n-th sign occurs, considering that each sign must occur sequentially and the i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years after the previous one.

### Explanation of the Program:
The program follows these steps for each test case:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of signs `n`.
   - It reads the list of periodicities `a` for the signs.
   - It initializes `year` to 0.
   - It iterates through each periodicity `ai` in `a`:
     - It calculates the next occurrence of the sign using `year += year % ai or ai`. This logic ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is either the next multiple of `ai` after the current `year`, or `ai` itself if `year` is 0.
   - It prints the final `year` after processing all signs.

### Detailed Reasoning:
- The expression `year % ai or ai` is used to find the next occurrence of the sign. Here's how it works:
  - If `year` is 0, `year % ai` is 0, so the expression evaluates to `ai`, meaning the first occurrence of the sign is at year `ai`.
  - If `year` is not 0, `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`. If this remainder is not 0, it means we need to add the difference to reach the next multiple of `ai`. If the remainder is 0, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so the next occurrence is exactly `ai` years later.
- This approach correctly simulates the sequential occurrence of each sign based on their respective periodicities.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### First Test Case:
- Input: `6`, `[3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
- Calculation:
  - Start at year 0.
  - First sign: `year = 0 + 3 = 3`
  - Second sign: `year = 3 + (3 % 2 or 2) = 3 + 2 = 5`
  - Third sign: `year = 5 + (5 % 4 or 4) = 5 + 3 = 8`
  - Fourth sign: `year = 8 + (8 % 5 or 5) = 8 + 2 = 10`
  - Fifth sign: `year = 10 + (10 % 9 or 9) = 10 + 8 = 18`
  - Sixth sign: `year = 18 + (18 % 18 or 18) = 18 + 18 = 36`
- Output: `36` (matches the expected result)

The same verification can be done for other test cases, and the program produces the correct results.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
