Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is reassigned to the value of the input, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
