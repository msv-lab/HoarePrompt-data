The function reads an integer `n` and an `n x n` matrix representing transition videos between scenarios. Each element in the matrix can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (no transition needed when i=j). It then outputs a modified version of the matrix where all '?' are replaced with either 'F' or 'S' to ensure that at most ⌊n/2⌋ transitions are either 'F' or 'S', while maintaining symmetry and consistency across the matrix.
