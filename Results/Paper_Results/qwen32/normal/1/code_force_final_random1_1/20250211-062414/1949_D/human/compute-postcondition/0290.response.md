To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to understand how the loop processes each iteration and constructs the `nx` string based on the given rules.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For each `i`, it constructs a new string `nx` of length `n` based on the characters of `xx[i]` and the conditions for replacing '?' with 'S' or 'F'.

2. **String Construction**:
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', it directly appends this character to `nx`.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', it checks if `i` is in `sb[:n // 4]` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4]`. If either condition is true, it appends 'S' to `nx`; otherwise, it appends 'F'.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After the loop completes all `n` iterations, there will be `n` strings printed, each corresponding to one iteration of the loop.
   - Each string `nx` is constructed as described above, meaning it depends on the initial values of `xx`, `sb`, and the specific positions of '?' in `xx[i]`.

Since the problem specifies the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final output state will consist of `n` strings, each constructed according to the rules mentioned.

### Output State Description:
- The output state consists of `n` strings, each of length `n`.
- Each string is constructed by iterating through the corresponding string in `xx` and replacing '?' based on the conditions involving `sb[:n // 4]`.
- The final output state is a sequence of these `n` strings, each printed on a new line.

Output State: **n strings, each of length n, constructed by replacing '?' in xx[i] with 'S' or 'F' based on the conditions involving sb[:n // 4].**
