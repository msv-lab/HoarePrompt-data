Output State: **`nx` is a string followed by 'F', `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, and `n` must be at least 1.**

Natural Language: The string `nx` now includes an additional character 'F' at the end. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, both still equal to `n`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 1 is still valid.
