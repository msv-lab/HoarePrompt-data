To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is only `j`.

Given the loop:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value `k + 1`. For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the current state of `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `k + 1`.

2. **Determine the new state of `j`:**
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `(k + 1) + 1 = k + 2`.

3. **Adjust other variables:**
   - The problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head (in this case, `j`) can be adjusted. Therefore, no other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `nx`) should be modified.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'F' connections in the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'S' connections in the input strings, and `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings. `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`. `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, or where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are zero. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` includes the character at position `j - 1` from the string `xx[i]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` includes 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`; otherwise, `nx` includes 'F'. `j` is `k + 2`**
