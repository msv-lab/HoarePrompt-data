The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `j` is `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should simply be this new value.

There are no other variables in the loop head to adjust (`n` remains unchanged).

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`**
