n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, where each line contains n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line represents the transition video between the i-th and j-th scenarios and can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (i=j). It is guaranteed that the i-th character of the j-th line is the same as the j-th character of the i-th line for all i and j. At most ⌊n/2⌋ transition videos are already decided (i.e., at most 2⌊n/2⌋ characters in the input are 'F' or 'S').
