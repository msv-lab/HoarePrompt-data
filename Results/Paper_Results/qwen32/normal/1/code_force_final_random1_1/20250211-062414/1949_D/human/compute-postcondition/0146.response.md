To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, we need to understand the context and the state of the variable `nx` before the print statement is executed. However, the initial state provided does not include any specific details about how `nx` is constructed or what its value is. 

Given the lack of specific details about how `nx` is formed, we can only describe `nx` based on the information provided:

Initial State: The final concatenated string `nx` after all iterations.

This means that `nx` is a string that has been built through some concatenation process during the execution of the code, but we do not have the specific details of this process or the resulting value of `nx`.

Therefore, the most precise description we can provide is that `nx` is the final concatenated string after all iterations.

Output: **nx (where nx is the final concatenated string after all iterations)**
