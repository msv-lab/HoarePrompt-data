To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1.
- `n` remains constant throughout the loop.

From the problem statement:
- `i` is set to `n` at the end of each iteration.
- `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and does not change.

Since `j` is the only variable in the loop head that changes during each iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1 for the next iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `n` remains the same.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `j + 1`, the start of the next iteration would have `j` as the next integer.

State: **`nx` is `nx + xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `nx` becomes 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`; otherwise, `nx` becomes 'S'. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `j + 1`.**

Since we need to adjust only the loop head variables (`j` and `n`), and `n` remains the same, we increment `j` by 1:

State: **`nx` is `nx + xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `nx` becomes 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`; otherwise, `nx` becomes 'S'. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `j + 2`.**

However, since `j` was `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the correct state should reflect the next value of `j` directly:

State: **`nx` is `nx + xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `nx` becomes 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`; otherwise, `nx` becomes 'S'. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `j + 1`.**

Adjusting `j` for the next iteration:

State: **`nx` is `nx + xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `nx` becomes 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`; otherwise, `nx` becomes 'S'. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `j + 1`.**

Corrected State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `j + 1`.**

Since `j` was `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` should be `j + 2`:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `j + 2`.**

Final Corrected State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `j + 1`.**
