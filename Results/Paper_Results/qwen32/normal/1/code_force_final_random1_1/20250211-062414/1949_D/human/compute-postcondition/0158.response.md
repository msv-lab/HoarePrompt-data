Postcondition: **The final concatenated string `nx` after all iterations is `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'. In all cases, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `n`.**
