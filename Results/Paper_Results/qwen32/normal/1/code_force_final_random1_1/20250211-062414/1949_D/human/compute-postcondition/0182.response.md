The code snippet provided appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. This means that the value of `nx` changes, while the values of `n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i`, `j`, and `sa` remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'.
- `i` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.
- `j` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.

After executing the line `nx += 'S'`, the only change is that `nx` now includes the additional character 'S'.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `i` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, `j` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, `nx` is updated to include 'S' at the end.**
