The only variable in the loop head is `j`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value, let's call it `j_prev`.
- Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j_prev + 1`.

From the problem statement, we know:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not specify the exact value of `j`, we assume that `j` has just finished an iteration where `j` was some value `k` (where `1 <= k < n`). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `k + 1`.

If `j` was `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have terminated, so we don't need to consider that case for the start of the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `j` incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`**.

However, since we don't have the exact value of `j` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

For clarity, if we assume `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 1`**.

But without the specific value of `k`, the most accurate general form is:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Given the typical structure, we can say:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`**.
