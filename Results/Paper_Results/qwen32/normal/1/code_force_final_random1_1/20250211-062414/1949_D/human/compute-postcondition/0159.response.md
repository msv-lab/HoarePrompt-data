The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the loop statement, `j` iterates from 1 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have taken a value such that the loop condition was still satisfied. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1.

Given that the loop runs as long as `j` is in the range from 1 to `n`, and since `j` was incremented at the end of the previous iteration, we simply need to increase `j` by 1 to get the state at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Since we don't know the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration except that it was valid (i.e., between 1 and `n`), we can denote the new value of `j` as `j + 1`.

State: **The final concatenated string `nx` after all iterations is `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'. In all cases, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `n`. `j` is `j + 1`**
