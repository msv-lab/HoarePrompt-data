The given code snippet initializes an empty list `sb`. None of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`) are modified by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'F' connections in the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'S' connections in the input strings, and `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings; `sa` is an empty list; `sb` is an empty list.**
