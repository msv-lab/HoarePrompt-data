Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'. Additionally, `i` is not in `sb[:n // 4]` and `j` is not in `sb[:n // 4]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `nx` was initially an empty string and now it holds the value 'F'. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, `sb`, and their conditions) remain unchanged.
