Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index 6 is incremented by 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', otherwise the element at index 5 is incremented by 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', or incremented by 1 for each 'F' in `x` at corresponding positions, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented by 1 for each 'S' in `x` at corresponding positions, specifically `b[4]` is incremented by an additional 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', and `b[5]` is incremented by 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', or incremented by 1 more if `x[j - 1]` is 'S'. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[6]` is incremented by 2. `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the previous input string `x`, `x` is the new input string, and `j` is 6.**
