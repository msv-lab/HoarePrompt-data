The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `j` is `j + 1`, `nx` is `nx` + 'S'**. 

This means `nx` now includes the additional character 'S' appended to its original value.
