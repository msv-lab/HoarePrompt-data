The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at position `xx[i][j - 1]` to the existing string `nx`.

Given the Initial State:
- The final concatenated string `nx` after all iterations is `''`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `n`.
- `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to `'?'`.

After executing the code snippet, `nx` will no longer be an empty string. It will now be the character at position `xx[i][j - 1]`.

Output State: **The final concatenated string `nx` after all iterations is `xx[i][j - 1]`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `n`.**
