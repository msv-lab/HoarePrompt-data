Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'F' connections in the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'S' connections in the input strings, and `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings. `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`. `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, or where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are zero. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. `nx` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sb[:n // 4] or j in sb[:n // 4]:
        nx += 'S'
    else:
        nx += 'F'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'F' connections in the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'S' connections in the input strings, and `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings. `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`. `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, or where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are zero. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is a string containing the character at position `j - 1` from the string `xx[i]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` is 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`; otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'F' connections in the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'S' connections in the input strings, and `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings. `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`. `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, or where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are zero. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` includes the character at position `j - 1` from the string `xx[i]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` includes 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`; otherwise, `nx` includes 'F'. `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'F' connections in the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the number of 'S' connections in the input strings, and `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all `n` input strings. `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`. `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, or where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are zero. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. `nx` includes the character at position `j - 1` from the string `xx[i]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` includes 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`; otherwise, it includes 'F'. Additionally, if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` includes an extra 'S' at the end if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`; otherwise, it includes an extra 'F' at the end. `j` is `k + 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
