### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by reading the input matrix and counting the number of 'F' and 'S' connections for each scenario. It then categorizes the scenarios into two lists (`sa` and `sb`) based on whether they have 'F' or 'S' connections, respectively. 

The program then decides which type ('F' or 'S') to assign to the remaining '?' based on the lengths of these lists. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, it assigns 'F' to '?' for scenarios in the first `n//4` elements of `sa` and the rest are assigned 'S'. Conversely, if the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, it assigns 'S' to '?' for scenarios in the first `n//4` elements of `sb` and the rest are assigned 'F'.

However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting sequence of transitions will never have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type for any permutation of the scenarios. The key issue here is that the program does not take into account the actual sequences of transitions for all possible permutations of the scenarios. Instead, it makes a decision based solely on the counts of 'F' and 'S' connections for individual scenarios, which does not ensure the required constraint for all permutations.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly ensure that no matter in which order the player approaches the scenarios, they will never see more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type in a row. A more sophisticated approach is required to handle all possible permutations of the scenarios and ensure the constraint is met.
