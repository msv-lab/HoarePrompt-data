The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the existing string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `nx` will be 'S'. The values of `i`, `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` remain unchanged. The condition that either `i` or `j` is in the list `sb[:n // 4]` is also still valid.

Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`. Additionally, either `i` or `j` is in the list `sb[:n // 4]`.**
