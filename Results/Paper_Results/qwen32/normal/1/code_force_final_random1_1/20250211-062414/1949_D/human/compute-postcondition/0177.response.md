The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` adds the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the current value of `nx`. Given the initial state, `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the operation. The value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not specified, but we know it is not equal to '?' and is being added to `nx`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][j - 1]`.**
