Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `nx` is updated to include 'F' at the end if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`; otherwise, `nx` is updated to include 'S' at the end.**
