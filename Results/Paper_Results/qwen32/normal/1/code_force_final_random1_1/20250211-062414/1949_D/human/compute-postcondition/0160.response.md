The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at position `xx[i][j - 1]` to the existing string `nx`. Given the initial state, we need to consider the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` and how it affects `nx`.

- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', it gets appended to `nx`.
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', the value of `nx` remains unchanged according to the initial state description.

Since the code only modifies `nx` by appending `xx[i][j - 1]` to it, the other conditions (related to `sa`, `n`, `i`, and `j`) remain the same unless `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'.

Therefore, the updated state of `nx` depends on the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`.

Output State: **The final concatenated string `nx` after all iterations is `nx + xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'. Otherwise, `nx` remains as per the initial state. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `n`. `j` is `j + 1`.**
