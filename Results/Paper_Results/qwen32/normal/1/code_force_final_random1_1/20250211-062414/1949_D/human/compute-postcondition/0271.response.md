Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'. Additionally, either `i` or `j` is in the list `sb` up to the index `n // 4`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `nx` has been updated to the string 'S'. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, and the condition involving `sb`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
