The given code snippet reassigns the variable `nx` to an empty string. This means that the previous value of `nx` (which was a string of length `n` constructed based on the values in `xx[i][j - 1]` and the conditions involving `sb[:n // 4]`) is discarded and replaced with an empty string.

Since the value of `i` remains unchanged and the initial state specifies that `i` is `n`, this value stays the same.

Output State: **`nx` is an empty string, `i` is `n`.**
