The code appends the character at position `[i][j-1]` from the 2D list `xx` to the string `nx`. Given that `i` and `j` both start as `n`, the character appended to `nx` is `xx[n][n-1]`.

Output State: **`nx` is a string concatenated with `xx[n][n-1]`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n`, and `n` must be at least 1.**
