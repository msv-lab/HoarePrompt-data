To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

- The loop variable `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `n` (inclusive).
- The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 because `range(1, n + 1)` will produce values starting from 1 up to `n` only if `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

The other variables mentioned (`a`, `xx[n]`, `sa`, `i`, `nx`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be directly adjusted to ensure the loop executes. However, since the task specifies only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, we will focus on `j` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`:** This variable is controlled by the `range` function and does not need to be initialized manually before the loop starts. It will automatically take the value 1 as the loop begins.
2. **Variable `n`:** For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The initial value of `j` does not need to be set manually as it is controlled by the `range` function.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
