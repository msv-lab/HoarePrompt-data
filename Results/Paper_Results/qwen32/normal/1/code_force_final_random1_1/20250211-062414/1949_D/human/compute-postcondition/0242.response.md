Output State: **`nx` is a string containing the character `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'**
Natural Language: The variable `nx` now contains the character located at `xx[i][j - 1]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?' still holds.
