The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the existing value of `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` could be one of three values before this operation:

1. `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'.
2. 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`.
3. 'S' otherwise.

After appending 'S' to `nx`, the new value of `nx` will be:

1. `xx[i][j - 1] + 'S'` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'.
2. 'FS' if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`.
3. 'SS' otherwise.

The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `sa`, and `xx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The final concatenated string `nx` after all iterations is `xx[i][j - 1] + 'S'` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'FS' if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'SS'. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `j + 1`.**
