Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with the element at index 4 incremented by 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', otherwise incremented by 1 for each 'F' in `x` at corresponding positions. `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[5]` incremented by 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S'; `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the previous input string `x`. `x` is the new input string. `j` is 5.**
