The code snippet appends the character `'F'` to the variable `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `nx`, we can only determine that it now includes the additional character `'F'`.

The variables `n`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `j` is `j + 1`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` with `'F'` appended.**
