Postcondition: **The final concatenated string `nx` after all iterations is `xx[i][j - 1] + 'F'` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?' and either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`. Otherwise, `nx` is `xx[i][j - 1] + 'S'` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', then `nx` is 'FF' if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`; otherwise, `nx` is 'SS'. In all cases, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `j + 1`.**
