The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is `j + 1`, but these variables are not affected by the given code snippet.

Therefore, the only change is in the variable `nx`, which now includes an additional 'S' at the end of its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `nx` is the original `nx` with 'S' appended to it.**
