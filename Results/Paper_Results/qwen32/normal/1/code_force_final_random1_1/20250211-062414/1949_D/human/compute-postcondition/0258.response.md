The given code snippet simply appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. None of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, `xx`, `sb`) are modified by this operation.

Therefore, the updated state of `nx` will be its original value concatenated with 'S'.

Output State: **`nx` is a string followed by 'S', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` (before appending 'S') is concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is found in the substring `sb[:n // 4]`, 'S' is appended to `nx`; otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.**
