The given code snippet increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Since `j` is initially `j + 1`, it means `b[j]` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24
- `a` is a list of length `n + 1`
- `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with each element `b[i]` incremented by 1
- `xx` is a list containing a single empty string
- `j` is `j + 1`

After executing the line `b[j] += 1`, the value of `b[j]` increases by 1. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[j]` incremented by 2 (since it was already incremented by 1 initially), `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, `j` is `j + 1`.**
