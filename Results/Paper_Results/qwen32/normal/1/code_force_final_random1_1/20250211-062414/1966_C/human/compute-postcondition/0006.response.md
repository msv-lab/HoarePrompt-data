To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Here's the given for loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the `range(1, n)` must generate at least one value. This means that `n` must be greater than 1 because `range(1, n)` generates values starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `tc` must be greater than 0
- `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a `0`
- `dp` is `True`

We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it is initialized by the `range` function.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

Adjusted State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a `0`, `dp` is `True`**
