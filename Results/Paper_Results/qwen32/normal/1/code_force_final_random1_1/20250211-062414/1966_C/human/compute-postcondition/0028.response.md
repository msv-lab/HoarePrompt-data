The code snippet provided decrements the value of `tc` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `tc` must be at least 2. After decrementing `tc` by 1, `tc` will be at least 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is at least 1, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a `0`, `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is `n-1`.**
