To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents some form of count or limit but does not directly influence the `print` statement in this context.
   
2. **`tc`**: Greater than 0. This variable is mentioned but not used in the provided code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output.

3. **`arr`**: A list of unique integers sorted in descending order, followed by a `0`. For example, if the original list of integers was `[5, 3, 1]`, then `arr` would be `[5, 3, 1, 0]`.

4. **`dp`**: Defined as `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`. Here, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, so `arr[n]` is `0` (the last element of `arr`). Therefore, `dp` simplifies to `arr[n-1] - 0 > 1 or not dp`, which further simplifies to `arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`.

   - If `arr[n-1]` (which is the second last element of `arr`) is greater than 1, then `dp` becomes `True`.
   - If `arr[n-1]` is not greater than 1, then `dp` depends on the previous value of `dp`. However, since `dp` is being redefined here, the previous value of `dp` does not matter. In this context, `not dp` would be `True` if `dp` were initially `False`, but since `dp` is being recalculated, we only consider the current calculation.

5. **`i`**: Set to `n-1`, which is the index of the second last element in `arr`.

6. **`n`**: Set to `len(arr) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in `arr`.

### Code Execution

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
```

Given the definition of `dp`:
- `dp` is `True` if `arr[n-1] > 1`.
- `dp` is `False` if `arr[n-1] <= 1`.

Since `arr` is sorted in descending order and ends with a `0`, the second last element (`arr[n-1]`) is the largest number in the list other than `0`.

### Conclusion

- If the second last element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[n-1]`) is greater than 1, `dp` will be `True`, and the output will be `'Alice'`.
- If the second last element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[n-1]`) is 1 or 0, `dp` will be `False`, and the output will be `'Bob'`.

Since `arr` contains unique integers sorted in descending order and ends with `0`, the second last element (`arr[n-1]`) must be greater than 1 unless the list only contains `1` and `0`.

Therefore, the output will be `'Alice'` unless the list only contains `1` and `0`.

### Final Output

Output: **Alice (if the second last element of arr is greater than 1, otherwise Bob)**

However, given the typical constraints and the nature of the problem, we can reasonably assume that the list will have more than just `1` and `0` unless explicitly stated otherwise. Thus, the most likely output is:

Output: **Alice**
