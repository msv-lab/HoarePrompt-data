To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `i`, `n`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here's the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `tc` must be at least 2
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a `0`
- `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`
- `i` is `n-2`

In the previous iteration, `i` was `n-2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n-1`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `n-1`
- All other variables remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` must be at least 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a `0`, `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is `n-1`**
