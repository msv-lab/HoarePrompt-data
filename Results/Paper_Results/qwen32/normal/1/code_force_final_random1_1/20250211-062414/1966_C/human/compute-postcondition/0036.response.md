The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `1`, and `n` is at least `2`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented to `2`.

The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `arr`, `dp`) are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tc` is greater than 0; `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a `0`; `dp` is `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not dp`; `i` is `2`; `n` is at least `2`**
