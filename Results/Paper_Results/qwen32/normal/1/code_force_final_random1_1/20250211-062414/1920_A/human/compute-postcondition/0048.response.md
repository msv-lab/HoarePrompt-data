The `continue` statement does not alter the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Given the initial state, none of the variables (`n`, `start`, `end`, `num`, `i`) are modified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1` encountered, `end` is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2` encountered, `num` is a list of all `v` where `t == 3` encountered and contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`.**
