The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `t` and `v`. This means the values of `t` and `v` will be updated based on the input, while other variables remain unchanged unless they depend on `t` or `v`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- `start` is `v` if `start` was originally less than `v`; otherwise, `start` remains unchanged
- `end` is updated to `v` if `t` is equal to 2 and `end` was originally greater than `v`; otherwise, `end` remains 1000000000.0
- `num` is `[v]` if `t` is not equal to 3 or `[v, v]` if `t` is equal to 3
- `i` is 2
- `t` is the first integer from the input (which will be overwritten)

After executing the code:
- `t` and `v` are updated to the values read from the input.

Since the new values of `t` and `v` affect the conditions for `start`, `end`, and `num`, we need to reflect these changes in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `start` is `v` if `start` was originally less than `v`; otherwise, `start` remains unchanged; `end` is updated to `v` if `t` is equal to 2 and `end` was originally greater than `v`; otherwise, `end` remains 1000000000.0; `num` is `[v]` if `t` is not equal to 3 or `[v, v]` if `t` is equal to 3; `i` is 2; `t` and `v` are the integers read from the input.**
