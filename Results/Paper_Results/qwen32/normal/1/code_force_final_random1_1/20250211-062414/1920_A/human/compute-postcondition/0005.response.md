The code reads two integers from the input, splits them into `t` and `v`. The values of `n`, `start`, `end`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is [], `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input.**
