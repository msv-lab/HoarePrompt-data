The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to whatever integer is input by the user. However, since the problem specifies that `n` is already an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100`, the `input()` function does not change the value of `n` within this specified range. Therefore, the value of `n` remains the same as it was in the initial state.

The other variables (`start`, `end`, `num`, `t`, and `v`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is an integer initialized to -1, `end` is a float initialized to 1000000000.0, `num` is a list that will store integers, `t` is an integer that can be 1, 2, or 3 representing the type of constraint, and `v` is an integer representing the value of the constraint.**
