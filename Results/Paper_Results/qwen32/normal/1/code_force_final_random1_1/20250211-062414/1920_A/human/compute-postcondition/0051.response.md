The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the list `num`. Since the loop iterates over `num`, the only state that needs adjustment is `i` to move to the next element in the list.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
- `start` is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1` encountered.
- `end` is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2` encountered.
- `num` is a list of all `v` where `t == 3` encountered and contains at least one element.
- `i` is the next element in `num`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to the next element in `num`. Since the loop iterates over each element in `num`, the next iteration will naturally take the next element from the list.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `num` following the current `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1` encountered, `end` is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2` encountered, `num` is a list of all `v` where `t == 3` encountered and contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`**.

Since `i` is the next element in `num`, it will automatically point to the correct next element when the loop starts the next iteration. No other adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.
