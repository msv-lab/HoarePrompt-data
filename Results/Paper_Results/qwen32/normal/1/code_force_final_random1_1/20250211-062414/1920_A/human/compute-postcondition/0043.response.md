Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1` encountered, `end` is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2` encountered, `num` is a list of all `v` where `t == 3` encountered and contains at least one element, `count_num` is 0. The current value of `i` is either less than `start` or greater than `end`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values.
