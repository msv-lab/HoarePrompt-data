Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. If `t` is equal to 1 and `start` was originally less than `v`, then `start` is updated to `v`. Otherwise, `start` remains unchanged. If `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is updated to `v`. Otherwise, `end` remains 1000000000.0. `num` is `[v]` if `t` is not equal to 3 or `[v, v]` if `t` is equal to 3. `i` is 2. `t` and `v` are the integers read from the input.**
