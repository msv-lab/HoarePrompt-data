Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is [], `t` is an integer that can be 1, 2, or 3 representing the type of constraint, and `v` is an integer representing the value of the constraint.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if t == 1:
        if start < v:
            start = v
    if t == 2:
        if end > v:
            end = v
    if t == 3:
        num.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is either -1 or `v` depending on whether `start` was originally less than `v`, `v` is the second integer from the input, `end` is updated to `v` if `end` was originally greater than `v`; otherwise, `end` remains 1000000000.0. If `t` is equal to 3, `num` is a list containing `[v]`; otherwise, `num` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is `v` if `start` was originally less than `v`; otherwise, `start` remains unchanged, `end` is updated to `v` if `t` is equal to 2 and `end` was originally greater than `v`; otherwise, `end` remains 1000000000.0, `num` is `[v]` if `t` is not equal to 3 or `[v, v]` if `t` is equal to 3, `i` is 1, `t` is the first integer from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. If `t` is equal to 1 and `start` was originally less than `v`, then `start` is updated to `v`. Otherwise, `start` remains unchanged. If `t` is equal to 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is updated to `v`. Otherwise, `end` remains 1000000000.0. `num` is `[v, v]` if `t` is not equal to 3, or `[v, v, v]` if `t` is equal to 3. `i` is 2. `t` and `v` are the integers read from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
