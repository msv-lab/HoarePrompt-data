Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is either -1 or `v` depending on whether `start` was originally less than `v`, `v` is the second integer from the input, and `t` is equal to 2. If `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is updated to `v` and `num` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `end` remains 1000000000.0 and `num` remains an empty list.**
