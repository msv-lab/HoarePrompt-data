You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - Then, it iterates over the `n` constraints and processes them accordingly.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - The program initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1,000,000,000. These variables represent the minimum and maximum possible values for `k`, respectively.
   - It also initializes an empty list `num` to store values that `k` cannot be (i.e., constraints of type 3).
   - For each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`t == 1`), it updates `start` to be the maximum of its current value and `v`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`t == 2`), it updates `end` to be the minimum of its current value and `v`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`t == 3`), it appends `v` to the `num` list.
   
3. **Counting Valid Values**:
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `start` is greater than `end`. If so, it returns 0 because it's impossible for `k` to satisfy both the lower and upper bounds.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of integers from `start` to `end` inclusive, which is `end - start + 1`.
   - It then subtracts the count of numbers in the `num` list that fall within this range (`count_num`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `start > end` correctly by returning 0.
   - It also correctly counts and subtracts the numbers that `k` cannot be, ensuring that they are not included in the final count.

### Verification with Example Input:

Let's verify the program with the example input provided:

#### Test Case 1:
```

1 3
2 10
3 1

- Output: `7`.

#### Test Case 2:
```
2
1 5
2 4
```
- `start` becomes 5.
- `end` becomes 4.
- `num` is empty.

- Output: `90`.

#### Test Case 4:
```

1 5
2 10
1 9
2 2
3 2
3 9
```
- `start` becomes 9.
- `end` becomes 2.
- `num` becomes `[2, 9]`.
- Since `start > end`, output: `0`.

#### Test Case 5:
```

- No valid `k` values.
- Output: `0`.

#### Test Case 6:

3 500000000
1 100000000
3 10000
3 900000001
```
- `start` becomes 100,000,000.
- `end` becomes 900,000,000.
- `num` becomes `[500,000,000, 10,000, 900,000,001]`.
- Valid `k` values: `[100,000,000, 100,000,001, ..., 900,000,000]` excluding `[100,000,000, 500,000,000]`.
- Output: `800,000,000`.
