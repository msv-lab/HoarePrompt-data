To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic step-by-step against the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis
- **Constraints Types:**
  - Type 1: `k >= x`
  - Type 2: `k <= x`
  - Type 3: `k != x`

- **Objective:** Find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints.
- **Guarantees:**
  - There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2.
  - No two constraints are the same.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k`.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `start` is initialized to `-1`, representing the smallest possible value for `k`.
   - `end` is initialized to `1000000000`, representing the largest possible value for `k`.
   - `num` is an empty list that will store values from type 3 constraints.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint:
     - If it's type 1 (`k >= x`), update `start` to be the maximum of its current value and `x`.
     - If it's type 2 (`k <= x`), update `end` to be the minimum of its current value and `x`.
     - If it's type 3 (`k != x`), add `x` to the `num` list.

3. **Counting Invalid Values:**
   - Count how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`. These are invalid values for `k`.

4. **Calculating Valid Integers:**
   - If `start > end`, it means there are no valid `k` values, so return `0`.
   - Otherwise, calculate the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]` and subtract the count of invalid values.

### Verification with Example Test Cases
Let's verify the program with the example test cases provided:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Constraints: `k >= 3`, `k <= 10`, `k != 1`, `k != 5`
   - Valid `k` values: `3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`
   - Output: `7` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Constraints: `k >= 5`, `k <= 4`
   - No valid `k` values
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Constraints: Multiple type 3 constraints, but valid range is `3 <= k <= 100`
   - Valid `k` values: `3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ..., 100` (excluding `6, 7, 100`)
   - Output: `90` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Constraints: Multiple conflicting constraints
   - No valid `k` values
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Constraints: `k >= 1`, `k <= 2`, `k != 1`, `k != 2`
   - No valid `k` values
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

6. **Sixth Test Case:**
   - Constraints: Large range with multiple exclusions
   - Valid `k` values: `10000 <= k <= 900000000` (excluding `500000000`, `10000`, `900000001`)
   - Output: `800000000` (Correct)

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
