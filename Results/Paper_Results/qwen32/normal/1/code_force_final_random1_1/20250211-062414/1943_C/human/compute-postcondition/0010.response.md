Output State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where the list at index `u` contains `v`, and the list at index `v` additionally contains `u`; `u` and `v` are the two integers read from the input; `u` is decreased by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The structure of `u2vs` remains unchanged, but the value of `u` is now one less than its original value. The value of `v` remains the same.
