To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the bounds of the range function (`len(path_ba) - c1`). The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration.

Given:
- `path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1` and having a length greater than 2 and even.
- `ops` is a list containing four elements `[(c2 - 1, 1), (c2, 1), (c2 - 1, 3), (c2, 3)]`.
- `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
- `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
- `i` is 3 at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's analyze the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the loop, we know:
- The loop starts with `i = 1`.
- It increments `i` by 2 in each iteration.
- The loop continues as long as `i < len(path_ba) - c1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 2, making it 5.

Next, let's verify if the loop can continue with `i = 5`:
- `len(path_ba)` is even and greater than 2.
- `c2 = len(path_ba) / 2`.
- `c1 = c2 - 1`.

So, the condition for the loop to continue is:
- `5 < len(path_ba) - c1`.

Since `c1 = c2 - 1` and `c2 = len(path_ba) / 2`, we have:
- `c1 = len(path_ba) / 2 - 1`.

Thus, the condition becomes:
- `5 < len(path_ba) - (len(path_ba) / 2 - 1)`
- `5 < len(path_ba) - len(path_ba) / 2 + 1`
- `5 < len(path_ba) / 2 + 1`
- `4 < len(path_ba) / 2`
- `8 < len(path_ba)`

Therefore, `len(path_ba)` must be greater than 8 for the loop to continue.

State: **`path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1` and having a length greater than 8 and even; `ops` is a list containing four elements `[(c2 - 1, 1), (c2, 1), (c2 - 1, 3), (c2, 3)]`; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`; `i` is 5**
