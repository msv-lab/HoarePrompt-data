The code snippet `v -= 1` decreases the value of `v` by 1. Given the initial state, `u2vs` remains unchanged because the operation only affects `v`. The value of `u` is already stated to be decreased by 1 before the code snippet is executed, so no further change is made to `u` in this snippet.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where the list at index `u` contains `v`, and the list at index `v` additionally contains `u`; `u` and `v` are the two integers read from the input with `u` decreased by 1 and `v` decreased by 1.**
