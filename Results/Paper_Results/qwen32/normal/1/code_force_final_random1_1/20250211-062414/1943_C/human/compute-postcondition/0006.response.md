The code appends the value of `v` to the sublist at index `u` in the list `u2vs`. Given that `u` and `v` are both integers derived from user input minus 1, the sublist at index `u` in `u2vs` will now contain `v` as its element.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where the list at index `u` contains `v`; `u` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1; `v` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1.**
