To determine the output state, we need to consider what the function `func_1` does. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact changes it would make to the variable `d`. However, we can assume that `func_1` processes the list `d` in some way and returns a new value or modifies `d` in place.

Given the lack of details about `func_1`, let's assume `func_1` could potentially modify `d` or return a new value based on `d`. For the sake of this example, let's assume `func_1` returns a new list that is a modified version of `d` (e.g., doubling each element in `d`).

If `func_1` modifies `d` in place, then `d` would be updated accordingly. If `func_1` returns a new list, then `a` would hold that new list, and `d` would remain unchanged.

Since we don't have the exact behavior of `func_1`, let's assume `func_1` returns a new list where each element of `d` is doubled. This is just an assumption for the purpose of providing an example output state.

Let's proceed with this assumption:

Assumed behavior of `func_1`: It returns a new list where each element of `d` is doubled.

Given the initial state:
- `u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices (as indices) that are directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree.
- `d` is a list where `d[0]` is `0` and `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `0` to vertex `i` for all other vertices `i`.

After executing `a = func_1(d)`, assuming `func_1` doubles each element of `d`:
- `d` remains unchanged.
- `a` holds the new list where each element of `d` is doubled.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices (as indices) that are directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list where `d[0]` is `0` and `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `0` to vertex `i` for all other vertices `i`; `a` is a list where each element of `d` is doubled.**
