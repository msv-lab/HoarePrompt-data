Output State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices (as indices) that are directly connected to vertex `i`. `d` is a list where `d[0]` is `0` and `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `0` to vertex `i` for all other vertices `i`, calculated using the doubled values in `a`. `previous` is a list containing the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to each vertex `i`. `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b`, `n`, and `n`. `n` is `previous[n]`. If `n` is `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
