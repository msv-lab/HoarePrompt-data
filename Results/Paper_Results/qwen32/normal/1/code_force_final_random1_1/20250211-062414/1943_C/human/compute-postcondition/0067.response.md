Postcondition: **`path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)`, where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even and greater than 8, `ops` is a list containing ten elements `[(c2 - 1, 1), (c2, 1), (c2 - 1, 3), (c2, 3), (c2 - 1, 5), (c2, 5), (c2 - 1, 7), (c2, 7), (c2 - 1, 9), (c2, 9)]`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**
