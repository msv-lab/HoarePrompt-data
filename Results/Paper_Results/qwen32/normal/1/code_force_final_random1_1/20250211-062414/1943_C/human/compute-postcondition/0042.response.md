To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop continues to append the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to the current vertex (`b`) to the `path_ba` list until it reaches a vertex with no previous vertex (i.e., `n` becomes `-1`).

Given the pattern observed in the first three iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `path_ba` is `[b, n]`
- After 2 iterations: `path_ba` is `[b, n, n]`
- After 3 iterations: `path_ba` is `[b, n, n, n]`

It's clear that the loop appends `n` to `path_ba` repeatedly until `n` becomes `-1`. Therefore, the final state of `path_ba` will be a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1`.

Let's denote the sequence of vertices from `b` back to vertex `0` as `b, n1, n2, ..., nk, -1`. The final `path_ba` will be `[b, n1, n2, ..., nk, -1]`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact sequence of vertices, we can generalize the final state as follows:

Output State: **`path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the final `path_ba` list will contain the vertices of the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b` in reverse order, starting with `b` and ending with `-1`.
