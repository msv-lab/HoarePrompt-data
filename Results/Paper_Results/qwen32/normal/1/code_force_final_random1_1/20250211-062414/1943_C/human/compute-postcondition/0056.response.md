Output State: **`path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1`; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**

In natural language: The list `path_ba` remains unchanged, still starting with `b` and ending with `-1`, with an even length. The list `ops` is still empty. The variable `c2` remains as half the length of `path_ba`. The new variable `c1` is assigned the value of `c2 - 1`.
