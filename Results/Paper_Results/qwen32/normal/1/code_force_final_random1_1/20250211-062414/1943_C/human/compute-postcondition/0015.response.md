The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. Given that `u` and `v` are initially read with `u` decreased by 1 and `v` decreased by 1, the new values of `u` and `v` will be the raw input values without any decrement.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where the list at index `u` contains `v`, and the list at index `v` contains `u` at least twice; `u` and `v` are the two integers read from the input.**
