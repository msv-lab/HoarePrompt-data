The code appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Here, `c` is the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` is 0. No other variables are modified.

Given the initial state:
- `path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1`, and the length of `path_ba` is odd.
- `ops` is an empty list.
- `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.
- `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
- `i` is 0.

After executing the code, `ops` will contain one element, which is the tuple `(c, i)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1`, and the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, 0)`; `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2; `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`; `i` is 0.**
