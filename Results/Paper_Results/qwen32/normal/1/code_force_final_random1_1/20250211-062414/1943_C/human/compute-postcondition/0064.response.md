The code appends a new tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `c1` is `c2 - 1` and `i` is 5, the new tuple added to `ops` will be `(c2 - 1, 5)`. 

Since `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and `path_ba` has a length greater than 8 and even, `c2` must be an integer greater than 4. The exact value of `c2` is not specified, but it remains consistent with the given conditions.

No other variables are modified by the code, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1` and having a length greater than 8 and even; `ops` is a list containing five elements `[(c2 - 1, 1), (c2, 1), (c2 - 1, 3), (c2, 3), (c2 - 1, 5)]`; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`; `i` is 5**.
