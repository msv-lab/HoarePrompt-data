The code appends the value of `u` to the list located at index `v` within the list `u2vs`. 

Given the initial state, `u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where the list at index `u` contains `v`. The values of `u` and `v` are integers obtained from user input, each minus 1.

After executing the code, the list at index `v` in `u2vs` will now include the value of `u`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list containing `n` lists, where the list at index `u` contains `v`, and the list at index `v` additionally contains `u`.**
