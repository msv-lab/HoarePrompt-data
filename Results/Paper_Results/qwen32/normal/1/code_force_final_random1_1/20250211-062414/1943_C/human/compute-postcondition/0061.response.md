The code appends a new tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `c1` is `c2 - 1` and `i` is 3, the new tuple to be appended is `(c2 - 1, 3)`. This means the list `ops` now contains three tuples.

Output State: **`path_ba` is a list starting with `b` followed by all the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `b`, ending with `-1` and having a length greater than 2 and even; `ops` is a list containing three elements `[(c2 - 1, 1), (c2, 1), (c2 - 1, 3)]`; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`; `i` is 3.**
