Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`, `power` is either equal to `n` (if the initial condition `power == n` was true) or `power` is `n - 1` (if the initial condition `power == n` was false), and `i` is incremented by 1.**
