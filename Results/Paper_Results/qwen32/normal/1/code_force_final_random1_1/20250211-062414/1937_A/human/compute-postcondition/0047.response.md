The code snippet increments the variable `power` by 1. Therefore, the new value of `power` is the previous value plus one. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`, `power` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1**.
