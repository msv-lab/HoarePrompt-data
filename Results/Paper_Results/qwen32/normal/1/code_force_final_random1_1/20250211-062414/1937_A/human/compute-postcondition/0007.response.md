The code snippet changes the value of `n` to the base-2 logarithm of its original value. Given that `n` was initially an input integer not equal to 1, after executing `n = log2(n)`, `n` will hold the value of the logarithm base 2 of its original value. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, and `power`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the original `n`, `power` is 1.**
