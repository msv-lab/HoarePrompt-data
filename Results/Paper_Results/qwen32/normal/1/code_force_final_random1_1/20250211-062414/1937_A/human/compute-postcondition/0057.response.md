To determine the output of the `print(2 ** power)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relationships between the variables:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` is greater than 0 (though it is not used in the provided code snippet, it is mentioned in the initial state).
   - `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`. This means `n` is the largest integer such that \(2^n \leq t < 2^{n+1}\).
   - `power` is defined as `n - 1`.
   - `i` is incremented by `n - 1` (though this does not affect the current `print` statement).

2. **Calculation of Variables**:
   - Since `n` is the base-2 logarithm of `t`, we have \(2^n \leq t < 2^{n+1}\).
   - `power` is `n - 1`, so `2 ** power` is \(2^{n-1}\).

3. **Determine the Output**:
   - The expression `2 ** power` translates to \(2^{n-1}\), where `n` is the integer part of the base-2 logarithm of `t`.

Given these relationships, the output of the `print(2 ** power)` statement will be \(2^{n-1}\), where `n` is the base-2 logarithm of `t`.

Therefore, the final output can be described as follows:
Output: **\(2^{n-1}\) (where \(n\) is the integer part of the base-2 logarithm of \(t\))**
