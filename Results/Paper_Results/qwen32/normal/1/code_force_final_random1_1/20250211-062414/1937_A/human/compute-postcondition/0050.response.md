To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop condition. The loop condition is `power < n`, so we need to ensure that this condition holds true.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that \(4 < t \leq 10^4\)
- `n_cases` is greater than 0
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`
- `power` is 3
- `i` is incremented by 1

The loop condition is `power < n`. To ensure that the loop executes one more time, we need to make sure that `power` is still less than `n`.

Since `power` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we need to adjust `power` and/or `n` accordingly:

1. **Adjust `power`:** We could decrease `power` by 1 to ensure that `power < n` holds true.
2. **Adjust `n`:** Alternatively, we could increase `n` to ensure that `power < n` holds true.

However, since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`power` and `n`), and considering that `power` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the most straightforward approach would be to adjust `n` to be greater than the current `power`.

Let's assume the current value of `power` is 3 (as given). To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:
- `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(4 < t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `power` is 3, `i` is incremented by 1**
