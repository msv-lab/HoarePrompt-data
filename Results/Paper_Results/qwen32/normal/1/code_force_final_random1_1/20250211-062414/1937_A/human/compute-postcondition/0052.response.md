To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses based on the given conditions. The loop increments `power` until it reaches or exceeds `n`, where `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`.

From the provided output states after the first few iterations:
- After 1 iteration, `power` becomes 2, indicating that `n` must be greater than 1.
- After 2 iterations, `power` becomes 3, indicating that `n` must be greater than 2.
- After 3 iterations, `power` becomes 4, indicating that `n` must be greater than 3.

This pattern suggests that after `k` iterations, `power` will be `k + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `k`. The loop will terminate when `power` is no longer less than `n`, i.e., when `power` equals `n`.

Therefore, the loop will execute until `power` equals `n`, meaning the final value of `power` will be equal to `n`.

Given that `n` is the base-2 logarithm of `t`, the final value of `power` will be `n`, and `i` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:
- `t` remains the same as the initial integer.
- `n_cases` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains the base-2 logarithm of `t`.
- `power` will be equal to `n`.
- `i` will be incremented by the number of iterations, which is `n - 1`.

In natural language, the final output state means that the loop will run until `power` matches the base-2 logarithm of `t`, and `i` will reflect the number of iterations performed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`, `power` is equal to `n`, `i` is incremented by `n - 1`.**
