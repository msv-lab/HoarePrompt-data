To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `n_cases`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop iterates over `range(n_cases)`, meaning the loop will run `n_cases` times. The variable `i` is the loop counter, which will take values from 0 to `n_cases - 1`.

2. **Dependencies**: For the loop to execute at least once, `n_cases` must be greater than 0. If `n_cases` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

3. **Initialization of `i`**: Before the loop starts, the value of `i` is not explicitly set because `i` is initialized within the `range` function during each iteration. Therefore, we don't need to specify an initial value for `i` before the loop starts.

4. **Adjustments**: The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n_cases` is greater than 0. The value of `t` (which is given as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) does not affect the execution of the loop directly, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Given these points, the adjusted state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` must be greater than 0**
