Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, and `n` is an integer. If the original value of `n` is 1, then `n` remains 1. Otherwise, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the original `n`, and `power` is either equal to `n` if it was already equal to `n`, or `power` is decremented by 1.**
