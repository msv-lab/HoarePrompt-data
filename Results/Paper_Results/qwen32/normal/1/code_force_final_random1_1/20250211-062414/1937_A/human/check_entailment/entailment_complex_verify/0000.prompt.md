You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: `i` is equal to `n_cases`, `t` remains unchanged, and `n_cases` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To verify the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that it correctly identifies the position of the number `1` in the array after performing the specified sequence of swaps.

### Analysis of the Problem Description:
1. **Initial Setup**: The array `a` is initialized such that `a[i] = i` for `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.
2. **Swap Operation**: For each `i` from `2` to `n`, the operation `swap(i)` is performed. This involves finding the largest divisor `d` of `i` (other than `i` itself) and swapping `a[d]` with `a[i]`.
3. **Objective**: Determine the final position `j` such that `a[j] = 1`.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program uses logarithms to determine the position of `1` after all swaps. Here's the breakdown of the logic:
- If `n == 1`, the array remains `[1]`, so the position of `1` is `1`.
- For `n > 1`, the program calculates the highest power of `2` less than or equal to `n` using logarithms and prints `2` raised to that power.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program against the provided examples and consider potential edge cases.

#### Example Cases:
1. **n = 1**: The array is `[1]`. No swaps are performed. The position of `1` is `1`.
   - **Program Output**: `1` (Correct)

2. **n = 4**: The array changes as follows:
   - Initially: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - After `swap(2)`: `[2, 1, 3, 4]`
   - After `swap(3)`: `[3, 1, 2, 4]`
   - After `swap(4)`: `[3, 4, 2, 1]`
   - Final position of `1` is `4`.
   - **Program Output**: `4` (Correct)

3. **n = 5**: The array changes as follows:
   - Initially: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - After `swap(2)`: `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]`
   - After `swap(3)`: `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`
   - After `swap(4)`: `[3, 4, 2, 1, 5]`
   - After `swap(5)`: `[3, 4, 2, 1, 5]`
   - Final position of `1` is `4`.
   - **Program Output**: `4` (Correct)

4. **n = 120240229**: The program calculates the highest power of `2` less than or equal to `120240229` and outputs `2` raised to that power.
   - **Program Output**: `67108864` (Correct)

### Edge Cases:
- **Small Values of n**: The program handles small values of `n` correctly as verified above.
- **Large Values of n**: The program uses logarithms to efficiently determine the position, which is appropriate for large values of `n` up to `10^9`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all provided examples and edge cases. It uses an efficient mathematical approach to determine the position of `1` without simulating all swaps explicitly, which is crucial given the constraints.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the final position of `1` in the array after performing the sequence of swaps by determining the highest power of `2` less than or equal to `n` and returning `2` raised to that power. This approach is both efficient and accurate for all tested cases.
