To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the variables involved in the loop condition: `power` and `n`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n_cases` is greater than 0
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`
- `power` is 1
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not part of the loop condition)

The loop condition is `while power < n:`. For the loop to execute at least once, `power` must be less than `n`.

Let's analyze the values:
- `power` starts at 1.
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of `t`, where `t` is between 1 and 10^4.

The base-2 logarithm of `t` (where `t` ranges from 1 to 10^4) will range from 0 to approximately 13.2877 (since log2(10^4) ≈ 13.2877).

For the loop to execute, `power` (which is initially 1) must be less than `n`. Since `n` can be as small as 0 (when `t` is 1), but `power` is 1, the loop would not execute if `t` were 1 because `power` (1) is not less than `n` (0).

Therefore, `t` must be at least 2 to ensure that `n` is at least 1, making the condition `power < n` true.

So, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `t` is at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`, `power` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1**
