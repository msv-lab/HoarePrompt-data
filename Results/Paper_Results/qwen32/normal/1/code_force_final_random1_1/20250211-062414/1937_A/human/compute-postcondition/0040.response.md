Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer if `n` is not equal to 1, otherwise `n` remains unchanged, `power` is either equal to `n` or decremented by 1 depending on its initial value, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` is equal to 1, `n` becomes the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`.**
