Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the original `n`, `power` is equal to `n`. Additionally, `power` is not equal to `n`** 

However, since `power` is defined as being equal to `n`, the condition `power != n` cannot logically hold under the given definitions. Therefore, the correct interpretation should reflect that the if condition `(power == n)` evaluates to false due to some external factor not mentioned in the precondition. Assuming no such external factor and sticking strictly to the provided information, the postcondition should logically be impossible under the given setup. But if we consider the structure of the task and assume there might be an implicit understanding that `power` could differ from `n` in some other context not provided, then:

Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the original `n`, `power` is not equal to `n`** 

Given the strict adherence to the provided information, the most accurate postcondition would be:

Postcondition: **This scenario is logically impossible given the precondition and if condition, as `power` is defined to be equal to `n`.** 

But if we interpret the task to mean that `power` could differ from `n` in some other context, then:

Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the original `n`, `power` is not equal to `n`**
