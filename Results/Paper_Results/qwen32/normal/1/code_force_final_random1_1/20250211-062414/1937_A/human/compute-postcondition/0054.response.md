Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variable `t`:** An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **Variable `n_cases`:** Greater than 0 (though this variable is not used in the given code snippet, it's mentioned in the initial state).
3. **Variable `n`:** The base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`. This means \(n = \log_2(t)\).
4. **Variable `power`:** Equal to `n`.
5. **Variable `i`:** Incremented by `n - 1` (though this variable is not used in the given code snippet, it's mentioned in the initial state).

### Code Snippet Analysis:

The code snippet contains only one line:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Determining the Output:

Given that `power` is equal to `n`, and `n` is the base-2 logarithm of `t`, we have:
\[ n = \log_2(t) \]
\[ \text{power} = n \]

Therefore, the expression `2 ** power` can be rewritten as:
\[ 2 ** \text{power} = 2 ** n = 2 ** \log_2(t) \]

By the properties of logarithms, we know that:
\[ 2 ** \log_2(t) = t \]

Thus, the `print(2 ** power)` statement will output the value of `t`.

### Final Output:

Output: **t (where t is the input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
