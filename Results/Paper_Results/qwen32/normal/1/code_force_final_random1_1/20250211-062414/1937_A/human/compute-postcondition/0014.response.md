To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop progresses and when it terminates.

The loop increments the `power` variable starting from 1 until `power` is no longer less than `n`. Given the pattern from the provided output states, we can infer that the loop will execute `n-1` times because it starts with `power` as 1 and increments it until it reaches `n`.

From the output states provided:
- After 1 iteration, `power` becomes 2, indicating `n` must be greater than 1.
- After 2 iterations, `power` becomes 3, indicating `n` must be greater than 2.
- After 3 iterations, `power` becomes 4, indicating `n` must be greater than 3.

Following this pattern, the loop will terminate when `power` equals `n`. Therefore, after `n-1` iterations, `power` will be equal to `n`.

Thus, the final output state will be:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n_cases` remains greater than 0.
- `n` remains the base-2 logarithm of the original `n`.
- `power` will be equal to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the original `n`, `power` is equal to `n`.**
