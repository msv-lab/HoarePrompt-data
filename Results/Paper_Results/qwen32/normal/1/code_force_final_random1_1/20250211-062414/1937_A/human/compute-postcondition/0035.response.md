Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n_cases` is greater than 0 (though it is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task).
3. `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer `t`. This means `n` is the exponent to which 2 must be raised to get `t`. In mathematical terms, \(t = 2^n\).
4. `power` is initially set to `n`.
5. `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task).
6. `power` is then set to `n` again (which is redundant since `power` was already set to `n`).

### Code Snippet Analysis:
The code snippet contains the following line:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

Given that `power` is set to `n`, and `n` is the base-2 logarithm of `t`, the expression `2 ** power` simplifies to `2 ** n`. Since \(t = 2^n\), the expression `2 ** n` is equivalent to `t`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(2 ** power)` statement will output the value of `t`, because `power` is equal to `n`, and `2 ** n` equals `t`.

### Final Output:
Output: **t (where t is the input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
