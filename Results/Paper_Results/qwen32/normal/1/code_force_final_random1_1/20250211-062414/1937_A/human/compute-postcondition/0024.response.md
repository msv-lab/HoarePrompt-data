Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n_cases` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `power` is either equal to `n` or decremented by 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement directly prints the integer `1`. None of the variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `n`, `power`, `i`) are used in this print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the number `1`.

Output: **1**
