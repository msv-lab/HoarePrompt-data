The code snippet `x = arr.find('1')` updates the value of `x` to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string `arr`. Since `arr` is a string of '0's and '1's, and `x` was previously defined as the index of the first occurrence of '1', executing this line does not change the value of `x` because it is already set to the correct index.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same for `x` and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 1, `n` is the newly read integer from input, `arr` is the newly read string of '0's and '1's without spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr`, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`, `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.**
