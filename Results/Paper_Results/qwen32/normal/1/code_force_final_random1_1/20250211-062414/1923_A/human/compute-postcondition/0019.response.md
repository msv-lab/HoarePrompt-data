The given code snippet updates the value of `y` by finding the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr`. 

Given that `y` was initially the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`, executing the line `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` will reassign `y` to this same value because it is recalculating the same index in the reversed string.

Therefore, the value of `y` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 1, `n` is the newly read integer from input, `arr` is the newly read string of '0's and '1's without spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr`, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`, `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.**
