### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the number of cells, and the state of each cell in a string format after removing spaces.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - `x = arr.find('1')`: This finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' (chip) in the string.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: This finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' when the string is reversed, which corresponds to the last occurrence of '1' in the original string.

3. **Extracting the Relevant Substring:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]`: This extracts a substring starting from the first chip to the last chip.

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - `print(z.count('0'))`: This counts the number of '0's in the substring `z`, which represents the free cells between the first and last chip.

### Analysis:

- **Objective:** The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a contiguous block. This is equivalent to counting the number of free cells between the first and last chip since each free cell will require exactly one operation to be filled by a chip moving from the right.

- **Logic in Code:**
  - The code correctly identifies the first and last chip positions.
  - It then considers the substring from the first to the last chip.
  - Counting the '0's in this substring gives the number of operations needed, which aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
