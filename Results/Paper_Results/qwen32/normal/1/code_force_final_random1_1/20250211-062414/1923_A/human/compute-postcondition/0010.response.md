The given code snippet reads a new string from input, removes any whitespace from it, and assigns it back to `arr`. This means that `arr` will now hold the newly provided string of '0's and '1's without any spaces.

Since the new value of `arr` is obtained from user input, the indices `x`, `y`, and the substring `z` need to be recalculated based on this new `arr`. However, the problem statement does not specify that these variables should be recalculated automatically. Therefore, we assume that `x`, `y`, and `z` retain their original values unless explicitly recalculated.

Given this, the only change in the state is the new value of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the newly read integer from input, `arr` is the newly read string of '0's and '1's without spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr`, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed original `arr`, which is equivalent to `n - x - 1`, `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.**
