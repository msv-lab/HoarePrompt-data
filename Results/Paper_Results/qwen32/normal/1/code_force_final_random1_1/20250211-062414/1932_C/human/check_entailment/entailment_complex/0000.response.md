### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array `a`), `m` (modulus), the array `a` itself, and the string `s` of commands.

2. **Constructing List `b`:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), to traverse the array `a` based on the commands in `s`.
   - It iterates through each command in `s`. If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` (pointed by `l`) to `b` and increments `l`. If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` (pointed by `r`) to `b` and decrements `r`.
   - This ensures that `b` contains the elements of `a` in the order dictated by the commands.

3. **Calculating Cumulative Product Modulo `m`:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` and a variable `p` to store the cumulative product modulo `m`.
   - It iterates over the elements of `b` in reverse order, updating `p` by multiplying it with the current element and taking the result modulo `m`.
   - Each intermediate result (`p`) is appended to `ans`.

4. **Returning the Result:**
   - Finally, the function returns `ans` in reverse order, which matches the requirement of the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Logic:** The logic correctly constructs the list `b` based on the commands and calculates the cumulative product modulo `m` in the required order.
- **Efficiency:** The program efficiently handles the constraints:
  - The cumulative product is computed in O(n) time per test case.
  - The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of `b` and `ans`.
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases such as:
  - When `n=1`, the single element is processed correctly.
  - When all commands are 'L' or all are 'R', the correct sequence is followed.
  - When `m=1`, the product modulo `m` is always `0`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and handles the given constraints efficiently. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
