Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` of `n` elements, where each element is the cumulative product of the elements in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`. The list `ans` is returned in reversed order.**

Explanation: The list `ans` contains cumulative products of elements in `b` in reverse order, each taken modulo `m`. Since the function returns `reversed(ans)`, the final output is the list `ans` itself but in reversed order. Each element in `ans` represents the cumulative product up to that point in the reversed `b` list, modulo `m`.
