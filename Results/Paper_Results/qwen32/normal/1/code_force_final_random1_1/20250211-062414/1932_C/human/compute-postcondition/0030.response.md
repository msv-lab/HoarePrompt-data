The given code snippet updates the value of `p` using the formula `p = p * v % m`. Based on the initial state, `p` is initially defined as `v % m`. After executing the code, `p` will be updated to `(p * v) % m`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing all `n` elements from `a`, ordered according to the sequence specified by `s`; `l` is `n`; `r` is -1; `i` is `n - 2`; `ans` is a list containing the single element `p`; `p` is `(p * v) % m`.**
