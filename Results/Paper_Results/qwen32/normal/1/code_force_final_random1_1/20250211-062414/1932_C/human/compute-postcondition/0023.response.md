Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `b` is a list containing all `n` elements from `a`, ordered according to the sequence specified by `s` (elements are taken from the left end of `a` if the corresponding character in `s` is 'L', and from the right end if it is 'R'); `l` is `n`; `r` is -1; `i` is `n - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `b` will contain all elements from the list `a`, but in an order determined by the string `s`. If `s[i]` is 'L', the element at index `l` of `a` is appended to `b`, and `l` is incremented. If `s[i]` is 'R', the element at index `r` of `a` is appended to `b`, and `r` is decremented. This process continues until all elements from `a` are added to `b`. At the end, `l` will be equal to `n` (indicating that all elements from the left have been considered), `r` will be -1 (indicating that all elements from the right have been considered), and `i` will be `n - 1` (indicating that the loop has iterated over all indices of `s`).
