Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the remainders of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m` before removing elements according to the commands. Instead, it incorrectly constructs a new list `b` based on the commands and then computes the product of elements in reverse order from `b`.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation Order**: The program constructs a list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the commands ('L' or 'R'). It then calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order and outputs these products. However, the problem requires the product to be calculated from the original array `a` before any elements are removed.

2. **Incorrect Output Sequence**: The problem specifies that for each command, the remainder of the product of the current state of the array `a` should be output before the command is processed. The current implementation outputs the remainders in a different order because it processes the commands and constructs `b` first, then calculates the product in reverse order.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 2 4 1
```

**Actual Output of Provided Program:**
```
1 4 2 0
```

The provided program outputs `1 4 2 0`, which is incorrect. The correct sequence of remainders should be `0 2 4 1` as explained in the problem statement.

To fix this, the program should calculate the product of the current state of the array `a` and output the remainder before processing each command. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    
    result = []
    for cmd in s:
        result.append(product)
        if cmd == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a.pop(0), m-2, m)) % m
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a.pop(), m-2, m)) % m
    
    print(*result)
```

This corrected version maintains the product of the current state of the array `a` and updates it correctly based on the command, ensuring that the remainders are computed in the correct order.
