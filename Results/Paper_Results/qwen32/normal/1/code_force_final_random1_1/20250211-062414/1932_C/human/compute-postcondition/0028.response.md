The given code appends the value of `p` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified by this operation.

Given that `p` is defined as `v % m`, and `v` is not mentioned in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `p`. However, we know that `p` is an integer resulting from the modulo operation of `v` with `m`.

Thus, the updated state includes `ans` now containing the single element `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing all `n` elements from `a`, ordered according to the sequence specified by `s`; `l` is `n`; `r` is -1; `i` is `n - 1`; `ans` is a list containing the single element `p`; `p` is `v % m`.**
