Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (the length of list `a` and string `s`), `m` (an integer used as a modulus), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the instructions in `s`, then calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order, taking each product modulo `m`. The function returns these cumulative products in a list, also in reverse order.**
