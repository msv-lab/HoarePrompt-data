To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `reversed(b)`, meaning it processes elements of `b` in reverse order.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4;
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5;
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4;
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4;
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R';
- `b` is a list containing all `n` elements from `a`, ordered according to the sequence specified by `s`;
- `l` is `n`;
- `r` is -1;
- `i` is `n - 1`;
- `ans` is a list containing the single element `p`;
- `p` is `v % m`.

The loop statement is:
```python
for v in reversed(b):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In the previous iteration, the loop variable `v` was assigned the value of the current element from the reversed list `b`. To proceed to the next iteration, `v` needs to be assigned the next value from `reversed(b)`.

Since `b` is a list of `n` elements, and we are iterating over it in reverse, the first value of `v` would be `b[n-1]`, the second value would be `b[n-2]`, and so on. Given that `i` is `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it implies that `v` was `b[i]` in the previous iteration.

For the next iteration, `i` should be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n - 2`. Consequently, `v` will be `b[i]`, which is `b[n-2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing all `n` elements from `a`, ordered according to the sequence specified by `s`; `l` is `n`; `r` is -1; `i` is `n - 2`; `ans` is a list containing the single element `p`; `p` is `v % m`.**
