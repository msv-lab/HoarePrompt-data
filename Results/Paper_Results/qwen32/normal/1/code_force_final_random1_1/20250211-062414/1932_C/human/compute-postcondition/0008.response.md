The code appends the value of `a[r]` to the list `b`. Given that `r` is initially `n - 1`, the value appended to `b` is the last element of the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `b` is a list containing the single element `a[n-1]`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `i` is 0; the character at position `i` in `s` is 'R'**.
