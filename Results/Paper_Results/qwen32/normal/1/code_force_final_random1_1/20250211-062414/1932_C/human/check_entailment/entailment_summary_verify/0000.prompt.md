You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (the length of list `a` and string `s`), `m` (an integer used as a modulus), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the instructions in `s`, then calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order, taking each product modulo `m`. The function returns these cumulative products in a list, also in reverse order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the remainders of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m` before removing elements according to the commands. Instead, it incorrectly constructs a new list `b` based on the commands and then computes the product of elements in reverse order from `b`.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation Order**: The program constructs a list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the commands ('L' or 'R'). It then calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order and outputs these products. However, the problem requires the product to be calculated from the original array `a` before any elements are removed.

2. **Incorrect Output Sequence**: The problem specifies that for each command, the remainder of the product of the current state of the array `a` should be output before the command is processed. The current implementation outputs the remainders in a different order because it processes the commands and constructs `b` first, then calculates the product in reverse order.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 2 4 1
```

**Actual Output of Provided Program:**
```
1 4 2 0
```

The provided program outputs `1 4 2 0`, which is incorrect. The correct sequence of remainders should be `0 2 4 1` as explained in the problem statement.

To fix this, the program should calculate the product of the current state of the array `a` and output the remainder before processing each command. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    
    result = []
    for cmd in s:
        result.append(product)
        if cmd == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a.pop(0), m-2, m)) % m
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a.pop(), m-2, m)) % m
    
    print(*result)
```

This corrected version maintains the product of the current state of the array `a` and updates it correctly based on the command, ensuring that the remainders are computed in the correct order.
