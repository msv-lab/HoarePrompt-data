To determine the output state, we need to consider the given code snippet and its impact on the variables. The code snippet provided is:

```python
p = p * v % m
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `p` is initially set to 1.
- `v` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume `v` is a variable that holds some integer value.
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^4\).

The operation `p = p * v % m` updates the value of `p` by multiplying it with `v` and then taking the modulus with `m`.

Since `p` was initially 1, the new value of `p` will be `v % m`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `b`, `l`, `r`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged because they are not involved in the given code snippet.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing all `n` elements from `a`, ordered according to the sequence specified by `s`; `l` is `n`; `r` is -1; `i` is `n - 1`; `ans` is an empty list; `p` is `v % m`.**
