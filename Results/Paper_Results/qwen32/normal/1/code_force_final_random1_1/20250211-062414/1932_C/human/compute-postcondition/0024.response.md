The given Python code snippet initializes an empty list `ans`. No other variables are modified in this snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `ans` while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `b` is a list containing all `n` elements from `a`, ordered according to the sequence specified by `s` (elements are taken from the left end of `a` if the corresponding character in `s` is 'L', and from the right end if it is 'R'); `l` is `n`; `r` is -1; `i` is `n - 1`; `ans` is an empty list.**
