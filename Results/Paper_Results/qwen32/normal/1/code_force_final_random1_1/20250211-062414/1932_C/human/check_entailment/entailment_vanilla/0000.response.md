Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a` of length `n`, and the string `s` of length `n`.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process the commands and compute the required remainders.
   - It initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to point to the start and end of the array `a`, respectively.
   - It iterates over the string `s` and appends either the leftmost or rightmost element of `a` to the list `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'. This part seems correct as it builds a list `b` that represents the sequence of elements being removed from `a`.

3. **Computing Remainders:**
   - After building the list `b`, the function initializes an empty list `ans` and a variable `p` to 1.
   - It then iterates over the reversed list `b`. For each element `v` in `b`, it multiplies `p` by `v` and takes the result modulo `m`, appending this result to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the reversed list `ans`.

### Issues with the Program:

- **Incorrect Calculation of Product Remainders:**
  - The program calculates the product of elements in the reverse order of their removal, which does not match the requirement of calculating the product of the current state of the array `a` before any element is removed.
  - The problem requires the product of all remaining elements in the array `a` at the beginning of each command, not the product of the elements in the order they are removed.

### Correct Approach:

- To solve the problem correctly, you need to maintain the product of the current state of the array `a` and update it as elements are removed.
- You can use prefix and suffix products to efficiently compute the product of the remaining elements after each removal.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
