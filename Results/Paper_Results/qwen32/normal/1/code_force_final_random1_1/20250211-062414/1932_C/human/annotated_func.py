#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4. s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list `ans` of `n` elements, where each element is the cumulative product of the elements in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`. The list `ans` is returned in reversed order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (the length of list `a` and string `s`), `m` (an integer used as a modulus), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the instructions in `s`, then calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order, taking each product modulo `m`. The function returns these cumulative products in a list, also in reverse order.
