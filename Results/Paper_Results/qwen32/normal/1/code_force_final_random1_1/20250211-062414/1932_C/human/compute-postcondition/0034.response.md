The code snippet appends the value of `p` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified in this code snippet.

Given the initial state, the value of `p` is calculated as `(p * b[n-1]) % m`. Since `ans` initially contains two elements `[p, p]`, appending `p` to `ans` results in `ans` having three elements `[p, p, p]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing all `n` elements from `a`, ordered according to the sequence specified by `s`; `l` is `n`; `r` is -1; `i` is `n - 2`; `ans` is `[p, p, p]`; `p` is `(p * b[n-1]) % m`; `v` is `b[n-1]`**
