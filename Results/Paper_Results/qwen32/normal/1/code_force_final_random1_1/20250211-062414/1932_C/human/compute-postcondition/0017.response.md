To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `i`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state was:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4;
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5;
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4;
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4;
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R';
- the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5;
- `b` is a list containing two elements, initially `a[0]` if `s[0]` is 'L' or `a[n-1]` if `s[0]` is 'R', and now also includes `a[1]` if `s[1]` is 'L' or `a[n-2]` if `s[1]` is 'R';
- `l` is 2 if `s[1]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 1;
- `r` is `n - 1` if `s[1]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 3`;
- `i` is 1.

Since the loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and the previous iteration ended with `i` being 1, the next iteration will start with `i` being incremented by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is 2.

No other variables in the loop head need adjustment because they are not part of the loop's control structure.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; `b` is a list containing two elements, initially `a[0]` if `s[0]` is 'L' or `a[n-1]` if `s[0]` is 'R', and now also includes `a[1]` if `s[1]` is 'L' or `a[n-2]` if `s[1]` is 'R'; `l` is 2 if `s[1]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1` if `s[1]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 3`; `i` is 2**
