To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the problem and the solution provided.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who start with `a` and `b` coins respectively. They take turns, and in each turn, a player can either swap their wallet with the opponent's or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

The key observation here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`). If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the game essentially reduces to a Nim game with a single pile of coins, and the player who starts with an odd number of coins can always force a win.

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Determines the winner based on the sum of `a` and `b`.
2. `func_2()`: Handles multiple test cases by reading input, calling `func_1`, and printing the results.

Let's examine `func_1`:
- It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
- If the sum is even, it returns "Bob".
- If the sum is odd, it returns "Alice".

This logic aligns perfectly with our analysis of the problem. The sum of the coins determines the winner based on the parity.

### Verification

We need to verify if there are any edge cases or scenarios that the program might not handle correctly. Given the simplicity of the logic and the fact that the sum of two integers can only be either even or odd, there do not seem to be any edge cases that would cause the program to fail.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement. It handles all possible cases of `a` and `b` within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. There are no edge cases or scenarios that the program fails to handle correctly.
