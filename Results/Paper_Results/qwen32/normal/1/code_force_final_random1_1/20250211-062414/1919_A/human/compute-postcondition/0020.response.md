To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's analyze the initial state provided:

- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input during the last iteration.
- `t` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for each corresponding test case.
- `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last test case.
- `result` is the next element in the `results` list.

Given this context, `result` is specifically described as "the next element in the `results` list." However, without knowing the specific values of `a` and `b` or the implementation of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `result`.

We can only say that `result` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the current test case, which is the next element in the `results` list.

Therefore, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **result (where result is the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the current test case)**
