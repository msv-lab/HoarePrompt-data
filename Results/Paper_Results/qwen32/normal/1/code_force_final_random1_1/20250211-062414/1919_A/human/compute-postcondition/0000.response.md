Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9; `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**

In simple terms, the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets remains unchanged. A new variable `t` is introduced, which holds the number of test cases entered by the user.
