The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means that the values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the input provided. The other variables (`t`, `results`, `winner`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `t` must be greater than 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**

In simpler terms, `a` and `b` now hold the values of the integers read from the input, while the other variables retain their initial states.
