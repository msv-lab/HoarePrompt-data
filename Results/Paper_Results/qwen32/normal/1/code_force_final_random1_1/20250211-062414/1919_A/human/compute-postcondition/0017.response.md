In this task, the loop iterates over the `results` list. The loop head contains only the variable `result`, which is used to iterate through each element in the `results` list. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `result` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input during the last iteration.
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for each corresponding test case.
- `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last test case.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- Since `result` is the current element being processed in the `results` list, for the next iteration, `result` should be the next element in the list.

However, since we don't know the exact position of the current `result` in the `results` list, we can infer that if the loop has just finished processing the last element (which means `result` was the last element), then there are no more iterations left. But if there are more elements, `result` should be the next element in the sequence.

Since the task specifies adjusting only the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `result`. Assuming there are more elements to process, `result` should be set to the next element in the `results` list.

State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input during the last iteration, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for each corresponding test case, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last test case, `result` is the next element in the `results` list**.

If we need to be more specific about the position, we would typically need an index to track the current position in the list. However, based on the given constraints, we can only adjust `result` directly. Therefore, the most accurate state we can describe without additional information is:

State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input during the last iteration, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for each corresponding test case, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last test case, `result` is the next element in the `results` list**.
