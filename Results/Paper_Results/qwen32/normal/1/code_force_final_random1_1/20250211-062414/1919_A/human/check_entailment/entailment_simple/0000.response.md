### Reasoning:
The game described involves Alice and Bob taking turns with the goal of removing coins from their wallets until one of them cannot make a move. The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on whether the total number of coins (a + b) is even or odd.

- If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob wins.
- If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice wins.

This is because:
- When the total number of coins is even, after each complete round (both Alice and Bob having made a move), the total number of coins decreases by 2 (one coin per player). This means that the parity (even or odd nature) of the total number of coins remains the same throughout the game. Since the game starts with an even number of coins, it will always end with an even number of coins, and thus Bob will make the last possible move.
- When the total number of coins is odd, the same logic applies, but since the game starts with an odd number of coins, it will always end with an odd number of coins, and thus Alice will make the last possible move.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets and returning the appropriate winner based on whether the sum is even or odd.
