The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means the initial values of `a` and `b` (which were not specified as specific integers in the initial state) are now updated to the values provided by the user input.

The other variables (`t`, `results`, and `winner`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing two identical elements, each being the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**. 

In simpler terms, `a` and `b` have been updated to the values provided by the user input, while the other variables retain their original states.
