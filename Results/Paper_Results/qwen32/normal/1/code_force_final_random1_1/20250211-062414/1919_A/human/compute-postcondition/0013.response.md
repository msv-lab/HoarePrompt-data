The code appends the value of `winner` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` contains two identical elements, each being the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. After appending `winner`, `results` will have three elements, all of which are the return value of `func_1(a, b)`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing three identical elements, each being the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**.
