### Reasoning

The original assessment appears to be accurate based on the provided problem description and the function summaries. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The game revolves around the parity (even or odd) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice wins.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of `a + b`.
     - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns "Bob".
     - Otherwise, it returns "Alice".
   - `func_2()` reads multiple test cases, processes each using `func_1`, and prints the results.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is straightforward and directly corresponds to the problem's requirements.
   - There are no edge cases or special conditions that need to be considered beyond the basic parity check.
   - The function summary for `func_2` accurately describes its role in handling multiple test cases.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program handles all possible cases within the given constraints.
