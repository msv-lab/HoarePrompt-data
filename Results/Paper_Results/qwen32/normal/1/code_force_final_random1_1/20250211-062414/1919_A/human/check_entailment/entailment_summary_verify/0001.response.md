Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program code, and the function summary to verify the correctness of the program.

### Problem Analysis:
The game revolves around the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins between Alice and Bob. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

- **If the total number of coins (a + b) is even**, Alice will always lose if both play optimally. This is because every time Alice makes a move, she will reduce the total number of coins by 1, making it odd. Bob will then make a move, reducing it back to even. Eventually, when there is only 1 coin left, it will be Alice's turn to take it, leaving Bob with no coins and thus Bob wins.
  
- **If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd**, Alice will always win if both play optimally. This is because after Alice's first move, the total number of coins becomes even, putting Bob in the same position as Alice was in the previous scenario. Thus, Bob will eventually be left with no coins, and Alice wins.

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic:
- It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
- If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
- If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

The function `func_2` handles the input/output operations correctly:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
- It calls `func_1` to determine the winner and stores the result.
- Finally, it prints all the results.

### Verification Using Function Summary:
The function summary for `func_2` confirms that it reads multiple pairs of integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, calls `func_1` for each pair, and prints the results. This matches the expected behavior as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins, which aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
