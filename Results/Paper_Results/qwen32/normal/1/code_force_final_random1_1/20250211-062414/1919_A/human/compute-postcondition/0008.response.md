The code snippet assigns the return value of `func_1(a, b)` to the variable `winner`. This means that `winner` now holds whatever value `func_1(a, b)` returns. The list `results` already contains the value of `winner`, so after the execution of the given line, `results` will still contain the same value, which is now explicitly the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `t` must be greater than 1, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**.
