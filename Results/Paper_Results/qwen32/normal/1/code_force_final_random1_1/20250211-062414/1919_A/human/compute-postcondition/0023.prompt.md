You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
        
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        
        results.append(winner)
        
    #State: `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input during the last iteration, `t` must be equal to the total number of test cases, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for each corresponding test case, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last test case.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input during the last iteration, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for each corresponding test case, `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last test case, `result` is undefined as the loop has completed all iterations.`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, with the constraints 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9. The function does not explicitly take `a` and `b` as arguments but is expected to utilize them. The function returns the total number of coins combined from both Alice's and Bob's wallets.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
