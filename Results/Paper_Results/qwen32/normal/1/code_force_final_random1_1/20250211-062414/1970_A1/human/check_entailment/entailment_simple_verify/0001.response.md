### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program based on the problem description, the code, the original assessment, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Balanced Parentheses Sequence**: A sequence where the balance (number of '(' minus number of ')') is 0, and every prefix has a non-negative balance.
- **Balanced Shuffle Operation**:
  1. Compute the prefix balance for each character.
  2. Sort the characters based on prefix balance in ascending order, breaking ties by position in descending order.
  3. Form a new sequence from the sorted characters.

#### Program Code Analysis:
- **Class Definition**: `BalanceInfo` stores the balance, position, and character.
- **Function `func_1`**: Comparator function intended for sorting but not used in the provided code.
- **Function `func_2`**:
  1. Initializes `balance_info` list.
  2. Iterates through the input string `s` to compute prefix balance and appends `BalanceInfo` objects to `balance_info`.
  3. Sorts `balance_info` by balance (ascending) and position (descending for ties).
  4. Joins the characters from the sorted `balance_info` to form the result and prints it.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that:
  - `balance_info` is correctly populated with `BalanceInfo` objects containing the correct balance, position, and character.
  - The sorting criteria are correctly applied: by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order when balances are equal.
  - The final result is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info`.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation.
- It notes that `func_1` is redundant because the sorting is done using a lambda function in `func_2`.

#### Evaluation:
- The code accurately computes the prefix balance for each character.
- The sorting logic aligns with the problem requirements.
- The final sequence constructed from the sorted characters is correct.
- The presence of `func_1` does not affect the correctness of the program since it is not used.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
