To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The variable `s` (the string) and `balance_info` (the list of `BalanceInfo` objects) are influenced by the loop but are not directly part of the loop's condition.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is pointing to the current character in the string `s`, and `n` is the total length of the string `s`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Adjustments**: To move to the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged because it represents the total length of the string.

Let's denote the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_current`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_current + 1`.

The `balance_info` list contains two `BalanceInfo` objects:
- The first object holds the initial balance, the initial `i`, and the character at the initial `i`.
- The second object holds the current balance, the current `i`, and the character at the current `i`.

At the start of the next iteration, the second `BalanceInfo` object in `balance_info` should be updated to reflect the new `i` and the corresponding character in `s`. The first `BalanceInfo` object remains unchanged.

Given the above points, here is the state at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing two `BalanceInfo` objects, where the first object is unchanged, and the second object reflects the new `i` (which is `i_current + 1`) and `s[i_current + 1]`.**

Since we don't have the exact value of `i_current`, let's represent the state in a general form:

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing two `BalanceInfo` objects, the first with the initial `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`, and the second with the current `balance`, `i + 1`, and `s[i + 1]`.**

This ensures that the loop can proceed to the next iteration correctly.
