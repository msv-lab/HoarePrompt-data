#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and 'position' is an integer representing the position of the corresponding character in the sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of infoA and the balance of infoB.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and 'position' is an integer representing the position of the corresponding character in the sequence. Additionally, the balance of infoA is equal to the balance of infoB.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the positions of infoB and infoA, which is 0 since their balances are equal and no additional information about their positions is given.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two objects, `infoA` and `infoB`, each having attributes `balance` and `position`. It returns the difference between the `balance` of `infoA` and `infoB`. If the balances are equal, it returns the difference between the `position` of `infoB` and `infoA`, which is zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `n` `BalanceInfo` objects; `balance` is 0.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is the string formed by concatenating the `character` attributes of `balance_info` objects sorted by `balance` in ascending order and by `-position` in descending order for ties)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and prints a new string formed by sorting the characters of `s` based on their balance values and positions. The balance value represents the net number of opening parentheses encountered up to that point in the string. Characters with lower balance values come first, and for ties, characters appearing later in the original string come first.
