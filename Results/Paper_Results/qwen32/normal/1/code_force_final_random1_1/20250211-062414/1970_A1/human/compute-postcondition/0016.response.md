The given code appends a new `BalanceInfo` object to the `balance_info` list. This new object contains the current `balance`, the current index `i`, and the character at position `i` in the string `s`.

Given the initial state, the `balance_info` list already contains two `BalanceInfo` objects. After executing the code, the `balance_info` list will now contain three `BalanceInfo` objects.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing three `BalanceInfo` objects, the first with the initial `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`, the second with the current `balance`, `i + 1`, and `s[i + 1]`, and the third with the current `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`.**
