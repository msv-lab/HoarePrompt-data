### Reasoning:

1. **Class Definition (`BalanceInfo`)**:
   - The `BalanceInfo` class is correctly defined to store three attributes: `balance`, `position`, and `character`. These attributes are used to keep track of the balance of parentheses at a specific position in the sequence and the character itself.

2. **Sorting Logic (`func_1`)**:
   - The `func_1` function is used as a comparator for sorting `BalanceInfo` objects. It compares two objects based on their `balance` attribute. If the balances are different, it sorts them by the balance. If the balances are the same, it sorts them by the negative of their `position` attribute, ensuring that characters with higher positions (appearing later in the original sequence) come first in case of a tie.
   - This logic aligns with the problem statement's requirement to sort by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order for ties.

3. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The `func_2` function processes the input string `s` to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects. Each object holds the balance, position, and character of the corresponding position in the string.
   - The balance is updated correctly as the function iterates through the string, incrementing for each '(' and decrementing for each ')'.
   - After constructing the list, the `func_2` function sorts it using the `func_1` comparator and then constructs the final result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted list.
   - The resulting string is printed, which should be the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - Given the example input `(()(()))`, the program correctly computes the balance and positions for each character, sorts them according to the rules, and produces the output `()(()())`, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. All functions work together to achieve the desired result.

### Your Response:
Reasoning: The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation by maintaining and sorting the balance and position information of each character in the input string. The sorting logic ensures that the output sequence meets the criteria specified in the problem statement.
Correctness: **True**
