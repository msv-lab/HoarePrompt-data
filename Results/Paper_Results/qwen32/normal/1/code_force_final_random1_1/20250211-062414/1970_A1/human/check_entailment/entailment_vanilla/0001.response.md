To determine if the provided Python program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement, let's break down the solution step-by-step and compare it against the requirements.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**
   - The goal is to compute the balanced shuffle of a given balanced parentheses sequence.
   - To do this, we need to calculate the prefix balance for each character in the sequence.
   - We then sort these characters based on their prefix balance in ascending order, breaking ties by sorting positions in descending order.
   - Finally, we construct the new sequence from the sorted characters.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` appears to be a comparator function used for sorting, but it's not directly used in the code snippet provided. It seems redundant since the sorting is done using a lambda function in `func_2`.
   - `func_2` is the main function that performs the balanced shuffle operation.
     - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store information about each character in the input sequence.
     - It iterates through the input string `s`, calculating the prefix balance for each character and appending a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info`.
     - After constructing the `balance_info` list, it sorts this list using a lambda function that sorts primarily by `balance` in ascending order and secondarily by `position` in descending order.
     - It constructs the final result by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list and prints the result.

3. **Verification Against the Problem Statement:**
   - The code correctly calculates the prefix balance for each character.
   - It sorts the characters based on the specified criteria (prefix balance in ascending order, position in descending order when balances are equal).
   - The final sequence constructed from the sorted characters is printed, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. There are no apparent issues or logical errors in the implementation.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
