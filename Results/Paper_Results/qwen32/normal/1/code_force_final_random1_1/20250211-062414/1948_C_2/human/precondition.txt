t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even, and two strings s1 and s2, each consisting of exactly n characters '<' and/or '>'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
