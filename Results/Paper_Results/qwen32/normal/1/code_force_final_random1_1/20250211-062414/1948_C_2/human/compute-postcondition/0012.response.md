Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a string of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'; `b` is a string; `i` is 5; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only impact of the code is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
