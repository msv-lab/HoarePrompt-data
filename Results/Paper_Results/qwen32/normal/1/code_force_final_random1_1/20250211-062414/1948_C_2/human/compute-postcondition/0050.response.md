To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration, starting from 1 and going up to but not including `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` and `b` are strings input by the user
- `i` is `i + 2`

Since the loop increments `i` by 2, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 2. 

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 2`.

However, we don't know the exact value of `i_prev` from the given information, but we know that it must satisfy the condition `i_prev < n` and `i_prev + 2 < n` for the loop to continue executing.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `t` remains `t - 1` (since `t` is not part of the loop head and there's no indication it changes within the loop)
- `n` remains greater than 1
- `a` and `b` remain the same (as they are not part of the loop head and there's no indication they change within the loop)
- `i` is adjusted to `i_prev + 2`, where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration

Since we don't have the specific value of `i_prev`, we can express the state as:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are strings input by the user, `i` is `i + 2`**

But to make it clear that `i` is adjusted based on the previous iteration, we can say:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are strings input by the user, `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 2**

For clarity and adherence to the format, we'll use:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are strings input by the user, `i` is `i + 2`**

This represents the state at the start of the next iteration, considering only the variables in the loop head.
