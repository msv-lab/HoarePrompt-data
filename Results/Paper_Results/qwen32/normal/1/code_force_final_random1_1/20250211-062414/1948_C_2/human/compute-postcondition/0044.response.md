Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are strings input by the user, and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both `<` with `i + 1 < n`, or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both `<`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The condition regarding the characters in `a` and `b` still holds true. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
