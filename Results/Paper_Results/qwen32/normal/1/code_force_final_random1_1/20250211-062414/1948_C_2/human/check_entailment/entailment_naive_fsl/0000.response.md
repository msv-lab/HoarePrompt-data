Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The program only checks certain conditions related to the arrows in the grid but does not simulate the robot's movement according to the rules specified in the problem description.

Here is a specific counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
><>>
<<><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It can move to (1, 2) and then follow the '>' arrow to (1, 3).
- From (1, 3), it can move to (2, 3) and then follow the '<' arrow to (2, 2).
- From (2, 2), it can move to (2, 3) and then follow the '>' arrow to (2, 4).

Thus, the robot can reach (2, 4).

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
NO
```

The program incorrectly outputs 'NO' for this input because it does not properly simulate the robot's movement and the conditions under which the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
