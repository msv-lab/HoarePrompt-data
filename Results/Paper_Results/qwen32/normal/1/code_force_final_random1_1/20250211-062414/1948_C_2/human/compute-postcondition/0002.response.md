The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that the value of `n` will now be whatever integer is provided by the user input. The precondition for `n` being an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 remains valid after the code has been executed, assuming the input adheres to these constraints.

The variable `t` and the two strings representing the rows of the grid remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer (which is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); each of the two strings representing the rows of the grid consists of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'**.
