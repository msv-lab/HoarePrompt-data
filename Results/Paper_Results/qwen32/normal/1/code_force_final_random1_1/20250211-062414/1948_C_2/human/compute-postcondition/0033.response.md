The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`) mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is straightforward and directly outputs the string `'No'`.
2. None of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `i` are used within this `print` statement.
3. Since there are no dependencies on the variables, their specific values (as described in the initial state) do not affect the output.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
