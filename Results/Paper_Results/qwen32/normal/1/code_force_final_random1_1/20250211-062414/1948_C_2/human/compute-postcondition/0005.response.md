In the given for loop, the loop iterates over the range starting from 1 to `n` with a step of 2. This means the loop will execute if there are at least two elements in the range, i.e., `n` must be at least 2. The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 2 in each iteration.

Let's analyze the provided state and determine what needs to be adjusted:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. This variable does not affect the loop execution directly.
- `n` is the input integer (which is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). This variable directly affects the loop execution because the loop iterates from 1 to `n` with a step of 2.
- `a` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'. This variable does not affect the loop execution directly.
- `b` is the input string. This variable does not affect the loop execution directly.

Given that the loop head only involves `i` and `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute. Since `n` is already defined as an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, this condition is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n`.

The loop variable `i` is initialized within the loop head and does not need to be adjusted beforehand.

Thus, the state remains unchanged with respect to the loop execution requirements.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer (which is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'; `b` is the input string.**
