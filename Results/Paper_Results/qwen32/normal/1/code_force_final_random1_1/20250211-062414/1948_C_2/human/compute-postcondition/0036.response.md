To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided information.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range `(1, n, 2)`, meaning it starts at 1 and increments by 2 each time, stopping before reaching `n`.
- For each iteration with index `i`, the condition checks if either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`. If this condition is met, the loop breaks and "No" is printed.
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, "Yes" is printed.

### Given Information:
- After 3 iterations, the loop has checked indices 1, 3, and 5.
- For the loop to continue beyond these iterations, the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` must not be met for `i = 1, 3, 5`.

### Final Iteration:
- The loop will continue until `i` reaches the largest odd number less than `n`.
- If `n` is even, the last value of `i` will be `n - 1`.
- If `n` is odd, the last value of `i` will be `n - 2`.

### Output State:
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, the final output will be "Yes".
- If the loop breaks at any point during its iterations, the final output will be "No".

### Conclusion:
Since the problem does not specify that the loop breaks during the first three iterations, we assume it continues until completion unless otherwise stated. Therefore, the final output state is "Yes" if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.

Output State: **t remains unchanged, n is an input integer, a and b are strings input by the user, and the loop prints "Yes".**
