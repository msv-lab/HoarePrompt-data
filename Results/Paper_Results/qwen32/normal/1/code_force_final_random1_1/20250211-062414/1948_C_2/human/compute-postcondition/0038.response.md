The code snippet provided reassigns the value of `n` to an integer value obtained from user input. The initial state specifies that `n` was already an input integer, but this value is overwritten. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`) and the loop condition remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new input integer, `a` and `b` are strings input by the user, and the loop prints "Yes"**.
