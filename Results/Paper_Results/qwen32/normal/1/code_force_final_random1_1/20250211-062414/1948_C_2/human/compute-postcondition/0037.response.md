The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop's execution depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` remains unchanged, meaning it still holds the number of iterations left.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` should be decremented by 1 since each iteration reduces `t` by 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are strings input by the user, and the loop prints "Yes"**
