In the given for loop, the loop variable is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable whose value is intentionally ignored) and the range is determined by `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as the current iteration count is less than `t`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration is "Yes", this seems to be an extraneous piece of information since it does not relate to the loop's control variables. We should focus on adjusting the loop's control variables.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

- The loop variable `_` is not relevant to the state because its value is discarded.
- The loop continues as long as the number of completed iterations is less than `t`.

If we assume that the loop has just finished an iteration, then the number of completed iterations would have incremented by 1. Therefore, we need to reflect this increment in our state description.

State at the end of the previous iteration: The loop has completed some iterations, and we are preparing for the next iteration. Let's denote the number of completed iterations so far as `completed_iterations`.

Since the loop has just finished an iteration, `completed_iterations` would now be one more than it was at the start of the previous iteration.

Thus, if we denote the number of completed iterations at the start of the previous iteration as `completed_iterations - 1`, then at the start of the next iteration, `completed_iterations` would be `completed_iterations`.

However, since we don't have an explicit count of completed iterations, we can simply say that `t` remains the same, and the loop will proceed if `completed_iterations < t`.

State: **`t` remains unchanged, and the loop will proceed if the number of completed iterations is less than `t`**.

Since we are only concerned with the loop head variables, and there are no other variables in the loop head except the implicit iteration count controlled by `t`, the state simplifies to acknowledging that `t` remains the same and the loop condition is re-evaluated.

State: **`t` remains unchanged**.
