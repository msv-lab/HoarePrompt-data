The code snippet provided initializes a list `res` with `None` values, where the length of the list is determined by the input integer `n`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `ar`, or `mex`. It only changes the `res` list to contain `None` for each of its `n` elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used in the form `mex - ar[i]`.**
