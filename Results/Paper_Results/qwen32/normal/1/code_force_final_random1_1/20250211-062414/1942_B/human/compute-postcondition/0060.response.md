To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and how the variables evolve through each iteration.

### Explanation of the Loop:
- **Loop Head:** The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- **Inner Loop:** For each test case, the inner loop processes a list `ar` of length `n`. It calculates a result list `res` where each element `res[i]` is determined by subtracting `ar[i]` from `mex`, and then updates `mex` if necessary.

### Key Variables:
- **`t`:** Number of test cases.
- **`n`:** Length of the array `ar` for each test case.
- **`ar`:** List of integers for each test case.
- **`res`:** Result list for each test case.
- **`mex`:** Smallest non-negative integer not yet encountered in the form `mex - ar[i]`.

### Process for Each Test Case:
1. Initialize `mex` to `n`.
2. Iterate over `ar` from the last element to the first.
3. For each element `ar[i]`, compute `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`.
4. Update `mex` if `mex - ar[i]` is smaller than the current `mex`.
5. Print the `res` list for the current test case.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations (i.e., after processing all `t` test cases), the output state will consist of `t` lines, each line representing the `res` list for one test case. The state of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `res`, and `mex` will vary for each test case but will follow the same logic as described above.

### Output State Format:
Since the output is printed for each test case within the loop, the final output state after all iterations is a series of `t` lines, each containing the space-separated values of the `res` list for that particular test case.

**Output State:** **Each of the `t` lines contains the space-separated values of the `res` list computed for each test case according to the described logic.**

In natural language: The final output consists of `t` lines, where each line corresponds to the result list `res` for each test case. The elements of `res` are calculated by subtracting each element of the input list `ar` from `mex` (starting from `n` and updating `mex` as needed) and are printed in reverse order of their appearance in `ar`.
