The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. The loop iterates over the indices of the list `ar` in reverse order, starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was used to access an element in `ar`, and the loop decrements `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, to execute one more time, `i` should be decremented by 1 from its current value.

Given that the loop runs as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`, the state needs to reflect the next valid value of `i`.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k` (where `k` is some integer such that `0 < k <= len(ar) - 1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `k - 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `i` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input and has at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`. If the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]`. `i` is decremented by 1.**

To be more specific, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input and has at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`. If the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]`. `i` is now `len(ar) - 2` if it was `len(ar) - 1` in the previous iteration.**

Generalizing, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input and has at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`. If the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]`. `i` is `k - 1`.**

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can say:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input and has at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`. If the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]`. `i` is decremented by 1.**

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `i` was `len(ar) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input and has at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`. If the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]`. `i` is `len(ar) - 2`.**

However, the most general answer without assuming a specific value for `i` is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input and has at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`. If the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]`. `i` is decremented by 1.**
