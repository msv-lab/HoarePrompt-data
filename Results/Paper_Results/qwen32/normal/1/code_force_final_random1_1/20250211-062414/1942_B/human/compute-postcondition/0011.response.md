The given code snippet updates the value of `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, and `mex` remain unchanged except for the specific element in `res` that gets updated.

Given the initial state, `i` is set to `len(ar) - 1`, which means `res[i]` refers to the last element of the `res` list. After executing the line `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`, the last element of `res` will be updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least one element, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]` except `res[len(ar) - 1]` which is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `mex` is unchanged, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`**.
