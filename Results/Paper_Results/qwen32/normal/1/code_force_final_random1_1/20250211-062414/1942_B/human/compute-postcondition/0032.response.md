The code snippet `mex = mex - ar[i]` updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Given the initial state, `mex` is initially defined in terms of `ar[1]` and potentially updated based on a comparison. After executing the line of code, `mex` is recalculated.

Here's the breakdown:
- Initially, `mex` is set to `mex - ar[1]`.
- The condition `if mex > mex - ar[1]` then updates `mex` to `n - ar[1]` if true.
- Regardless of the initial conditions, the line `mex = mex - ar[i]` will reassign `mex` to its current value minus `ar[i]`.

Since `i` is 1, `ar[i]` is `ar[1]`. Therefore, the new value of `mex` is `mex - ar[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[1]` is `mex - ar[1]`. `mex` is now `mex - ar[1]`, `i` is 1.**
