### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array `a` in reverse order and constructing the permutation `p` using the relationship \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` values with length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the highest possible value that could be the MEX at the start (since all numbers from 0 to n-1 are potentially candidates).

2. **Reverse Iteration**:
   - The program iterates over the array `a` from the last element to the first.
   - For each element `ar[i]` in `a`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Updating MEX**:
   - After calculating `res[i]`, the program checks if the current `mex` should be updated to `mex - ar[i]`. This check ensures that `mex` always holds the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used yet in the permutation `p`.

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing `res` for the entire array `a`, the program prints the permutation `res`.

### Analysis:

- The approach of iterating in reverse and updating `mex` ensures that each `res[i]` is correctly calculated based on the MEX of the already constructed part of `p`.
- The logic of decrementing `mex` whenever a smaller unused integer is found ensures that the permutation `p` remains valid and contains all integers from 0 to n-1 exactly once.
- The program handles multiple test cases efficiently by resetting `res` and `mex` for each new test case.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` for each test case based on the array `a`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

**Correctness: True**
