To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each element of the array `ar` in reverse order and updates the `res` list and the `mex` variable accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. The loop starts from the last index of `ar` and moves towards the first index.
2. For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`.
3. It then checks if the current `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`. If true, it updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]`.

The loop continues until all elements of `ar` have been processed.

### Final Output State Analysis

- **`t`**: This variable is not modified within the loop and remains the same as the initial state.
- **`n`**: This variable is also not modified within the loop and remains the same as the initial state.
- **`ar`**: This list is not modified within the loop and remains the same as the initial state.
- **`res`**: This list is filled with values calculated as `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from the end of `ar` to the beginning.
- **`mex`**: This variable is updated during the loop based on the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]`. By the end of the loop, `mex` will hold the smallest non-negative integer that was not encountered in the form `mex - ar[i]` during the loop execution.

### Detailed Explanation

Let's consider an example to illustrate the process:

Suppose `ar = [3, 1, 2]` and `n = 5`.

1. **Initialization**: `mex = 5`, `res = [None, None, None]`
2. **First Iteration (i = 2)**:
   - `res[2] = 5 - 2 = 3`
   - `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
3. **Second Iteration (i = 1)**:
   - `res[1] = 3 - 1 = 2`
   - `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
4. **Third Iteration (i = 0)**:
   - `res[0] = 2 - 3 = -1` (but since `mex` is 2, `res[0]` is actually `2 - 3 = -1` which is less than 0, so it doesn't change `mex`)
   - `mex = min(2, -1)` does not update `mex` because `-1` is not a valid `mex` value (it should be non-negative).

Thus, after all iterations, `res = [2, 2, 3]` and `mex = 2`.

### General Case

After processing all elements, `res` will contain the differences `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` in reverse order, and `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that was not encountered in the form `mex - ar[i]`.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from the end of `ar` to the beginning, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not encountered in the form `mex - ar[i]` during the loop execution.**

In simpler terms, `res` contains the computed differences, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not used in these differences.
