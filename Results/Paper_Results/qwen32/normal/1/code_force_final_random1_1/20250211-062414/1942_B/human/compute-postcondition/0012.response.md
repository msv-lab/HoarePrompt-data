The given code modifies the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Since `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, the operation effectively subtracts the last element of the list `ar` from `mex`.

Given that `res[len(ar) - 1]` is initially set to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, after the operation `mex = mex - ar[i]`, the new value of `mex` will be the same as `res[len(ar) - 1]`. However, since the problem asks for the updated state, we only need to reflect the change in `mex`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least one element, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]` except `res[len(ar) - 1]` which is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `mex` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`**.
