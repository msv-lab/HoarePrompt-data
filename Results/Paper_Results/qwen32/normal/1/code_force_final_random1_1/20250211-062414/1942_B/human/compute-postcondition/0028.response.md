The code snippet updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Given the initial state, `mex` was initially set to `n`. After the operation, `mex` becomes `n - ar[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, `res` is a list where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`, and `mex` is `n - ar[i]`.**
