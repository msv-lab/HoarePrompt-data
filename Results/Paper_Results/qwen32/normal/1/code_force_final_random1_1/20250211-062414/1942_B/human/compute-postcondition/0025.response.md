To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can see that the loop variable is `i`, and the range function is dependent on `ar`.

Let's break down the requirements for the loop to execute:

1. **`ar`**: The list `ar` must have at least one element because `range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1)` requires `len(ar) - 1` to be a non-negative integer. If `ar` is empty (`len(ar) == 0`), then `len(ar) - 1` would be `-1`, and the range would be invalid (start value less than stop value).

2. **`i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to `len(ar) - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `ar` must have at least one element.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `ar` has at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `res`, `mex`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `ar` has at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, `res` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, and `mex` is `n`**.
