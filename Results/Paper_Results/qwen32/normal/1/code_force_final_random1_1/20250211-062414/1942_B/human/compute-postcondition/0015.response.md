The code assigns the value `mex - ar[i]` to `res[i]`. Given that `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `res[len(ar) - 2]` is now `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least one element, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]` except `res[len(ar) - 1]` which is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]` and `res[len(ar) - 2]` which is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged. `i` is `len(ar) - 2`.**
