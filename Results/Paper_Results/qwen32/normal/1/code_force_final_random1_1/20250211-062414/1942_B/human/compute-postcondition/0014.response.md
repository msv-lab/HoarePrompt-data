The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`. Since the previous iteration ended with `i` being `len(ar) - 1`, the next iteration would require `i` to be decremented by 1.

Let's break it down:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `len(ar) - 1`.
- The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `len(ar) - 2`.

No other variables in the loop head (`ar`) need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop control mechanism.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least one element, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]` except `res[len(ar) - 1]` which is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged. `i` is `len(ar) - 2`**
