### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and verify if it correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `mex` to `n`. This is because initially, the MEX of an empty set is `0`, but since we're iterating backwards, starting with `mex = n` ensures that we correctly decrement it as we build the permutation from the end to the beginning.

2. **Iterating Backwards**:
   - The loop iterates from the last index to the first index of the array `a`.
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`. This step is based on the relationship \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). Rearranging this equation, we get \( p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i \).
   - After calculating `res[i]`, the program updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `res[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used yet in the permutation `p`.

3. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `p` for a test case, the program prints it.

### Verification:

Let's verify the correctness using the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  1 1 -2 1 2
  ```
- Calculation:
  - Start with `mex = 5`.
  - Iteration 1 (i=4): `res[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, update `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`.
  - Iteration 2 (i=3): `res[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, update `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`.
  - Iteration 3 (i=2): `res[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, update `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`.
  - Iteration 4 (i=1): `res[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, update `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`.
  - Iteration 5 (i=0): `res[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, update `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`.
- Output: `0 1 4 2 3`

This matches the expected output.

#### Example 2:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  1 1 1 1 1
  ```
- Calculation:
  - Start with `mex = 5`.
  - Iteration 1 (i=4): `res[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, update `mex = min(5, 4) = 4`.
  - Iteration 2 (i=3): `res[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, update `mex = min(4, 3) = 3`.
  - Iteration 3 (i=2): `res[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, update `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`.
  - Iteration 4 (i=1): `res[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, update `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`.
  - Iteration 5 (i=0): `res[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, update `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`.
- Output: `0 1 2 3 4`

This also matches the expected output.

#### Example 3:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  -2 1 2
  ```
- Calculation:
  - Start with `mex = 3`.
  - Iteration 1 (i=2): `res[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, update `mex = min(3, 1) = 1`.
  - Iteration 2 (i=1): `res[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, update `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`.
  - Iteration 3 (i=0): `res[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, update `mex = min(0, 2) = 0`.
- Output: `2 0 1`

This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
