The given code snippet only contains the line `lst = []`, which reinitializes the list `lst` to an empty list. None of the other variables (`final`, `n`, `t`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `mini`) are affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`final` is a sorted list; if `len(final) == 0`, then `final` is updated to contain either the element `[0]` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or `n` if `c1` is less than 50; `n` is an input integer; `t` is decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is []; `mini` remains unchanged.**
