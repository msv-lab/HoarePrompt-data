The code snippet appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `i + 1` evaluates to 3. Therefore, 3 is appended to `lst`.

No other variables are modified by the code snippet, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `s` is the string input provided by the user, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `mini` is 100000000, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 3`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `i` is 2, `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `one` is incremented by 1, `lst` contains the element 3.**
