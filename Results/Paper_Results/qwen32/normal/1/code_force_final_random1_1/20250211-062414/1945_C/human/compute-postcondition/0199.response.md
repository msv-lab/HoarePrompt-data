To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and the conditions given. The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst` and appends the element to the list `final` if the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini` is satisfied.

From the provided information:
- `final` starts as an empty list.
- `lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50.
- `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, it appears that `lst` has at least three elements, and the loop appends an element to `final` if the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini` holds true for that element.

After all iterations, `final` will contain all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. This means that if there are multiple elements in `lst` that satisfy this condition, they will all be appended to `final`.

Let's summarize the final output state:

- `final` will contain all elements from `lst` that satisfy `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, `mini`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

Output State: **`final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. All other variables remain unchanged.**

In natural language: After all iterations, the `final` list will include all indices from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the index is equal to `mini`. No other variables will change their values.
