The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 4, `i + 1` equals 5. Therefore, the list `lst` will now contain the value 5.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `final` is still a sorted list.
- `n` is still greater than 1.
- `t` has been decremented by 1 (unchanged in this snippet).
- `s` is still an input string.
- `pk` is still `n / 2`.
- `sl` is still a list of characters from `s`.
- `o` is still the count of '1' in `s`.
- `z` is still the count of '0' in `s`.
- `zero` is still 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', otherwise `zero` is 1.
- `one` is still 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` was not '0', otherwise `one` is 0.
- `lst` now contains the value 5.
- `mini` is still 100000000.
- `zero_perc` is still 40 if the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', otherwise `zero_perc` is 20.
- `one_perc` is still `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 5)`.
- `i` is still 4.

Output State: **`final` is a sorted list; `n` is greater than 1; `t` has been decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', otherwise `zero` is 1; `one` is 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` was not '0', otherwise `one` is 0; `lst` is [5]; `mini` is 100000000; `zero_perc` is 40 if the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', otherwise `zero_perc` is 20; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 5)`; `i` is 4.**
