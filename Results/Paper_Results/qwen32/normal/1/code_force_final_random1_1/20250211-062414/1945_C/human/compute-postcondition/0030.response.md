The given code snippet updates the value of `zero_perc`. It calculates `zero_perc` as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Since `i` is initially 1, the denominator becomes 2. The value of `zero` depends on whether `s[i]` is '0' or not. However, the problem statement does not specify the value of `zero` before this line, so we'll assume `zero` is already defined and holds the count of '0's encountered so far.

Given that `i` is 1, the new value of `zero_perc` will be `zero * 100 // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `s` is the string input provided by the user, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `mini` is 100000000, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 2`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, and `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is '0', then `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s` plus 1. If `s[i]` is '1', then `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s` plus 1. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is a list containing `[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.**
