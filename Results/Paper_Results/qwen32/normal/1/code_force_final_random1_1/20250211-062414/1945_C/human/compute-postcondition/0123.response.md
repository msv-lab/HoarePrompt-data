Postcondition: **`final` is a list containing `[elem]` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, otherwise `final` remains an empty list. `n` remains the same, `t` remains the same if the original length of `final` was not 0, `s` remains the same, `pk` remains `n / 2`, `sl` remains the list of characters from the string `s`, `o` remains the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` remains the count of '0's in `sl`, `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`, `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`, `lst` is a list containing at least one element, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.**
