Postcondition: **`final` is [1, 3]. However, the length of `final` is 0.** 

(Note: The provided if condition `if (len(final) == 0):` contradicts the precondition where `final` is initialized as `[1, 3]`. In reality, the code block inside this if statement would never execute given the precondition. However, based on the task requirements, the postcondition is formulated as requested.)
