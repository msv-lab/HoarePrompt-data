Output State: **`final` is a list, if the original length of `final` was 0, then `final` is [0] if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` is [n]; if the original length of `final` was not 0, then `final` remains [1, 3]; `n` is an input integer; `t` is 1 if the original length of `final` was not 0.**

Natural Language: The value of `n` is set to an input integer. The list `final` retains its original state unless it was initially empty, in which case it changes based on the calculation of `c1`. The variable `t` remains 1 if `final` was originally not empty.
