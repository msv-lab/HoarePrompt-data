Output State: **`final` is [0], `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**

Explanation: The list `final` now contains one element, which is `0`. The value of `c1` remains unchanged and is still calculated as `o * 100 // n`, with the condition that `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.
