The code snippet `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Given the initial state, `final` already contains elements based on certain conditions related to `pk`, `elem`, and `mini`. After appending `elem`, the new state of `final` will include this additional element.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`final` is a list containing its original elements plus `elem`; `n` remains the same; `t` remains the same if the original length of `final` was not 0; `s` remains the same; `pk` remains `n / 2`; `sl` remains the list of characters from the string `s`; `o` remains the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` remains the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list containing at least one element; `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `elem` is `next_elem`.**

In simpler terms, the list `final` now includes the new element `elem`, while all other variables retain their original values.
