Output State: **`final` is a sorted list; `n` is greater than 1; `t` has been decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list containing at least one element; `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the minimum of the previous `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`; `ele` is the next element in `lst`.**

Explanation: The value of `mini` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. All other variables retain their previous values.
