The code snippet converts the string `s` into a list of characters and assigns it to `sl`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `pk` is determined by whether `n` is even or odd, but since the code does not modify `pk`, its value remains as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input provided by the user; `pk` is set to `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`.**
