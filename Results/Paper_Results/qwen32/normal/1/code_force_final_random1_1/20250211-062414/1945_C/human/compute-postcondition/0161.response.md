Postcondition: **`final` is a sorted list; `n` is greater than 1; `t` has been decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0; `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list; `mini` is 100000000; `zero_perc` is the percentage of zeros up to index `i` in `s` and is greater than or equal to 50; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` and is greater than or equal to 50.**
