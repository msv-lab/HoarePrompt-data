Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is the string input provided by the user, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `zero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[0:n-1]`, `one` is the count of '1's in the substring `s[0:n-1]`, `lst` is a list of indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50%, `mini` is the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any index in `lst`, `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is "0101", `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is ['0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 2, `z` is 2, `zero` is 1, `one` is 1, `lst` contains at least one index (e.g., [1]), `mini` is the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any index in `lst`. If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, `final` is a list containing `elem`; otherwise, `final` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is "0101", `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is ['0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 2, `z` is 2, `zero` is 1, `one` is 1, `lst` contains at least two indices (e.g., [1, 3]), `mini` is the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any index in `lst`. If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, `final` is a list containing `elem`; otherwise, `final` remains an empty list, `elem` is 3. Since `abs(pk - elem) == mini` is true, `final` is [3].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 4, `s` is "0101", `pk` is 2, `sl` is ['0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 2, `z` is 2, `zero` is 1, `one` is 1, `lst` contains at least two indices (e.g., [1, 3]), `mini` is 1, `final` is either [] or [1] depending on whether `abs(pk - elem) == mini` is false or true, `elem` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
