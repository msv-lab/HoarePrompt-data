The code appends the variable `elem` to the list `final`. Given the initial state, `final` was an empty list. After the operation, `final` will contain the single element `elem`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `elem`, we cannot determine its specific value, but we know it has been added to `final`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is "0101", `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is ['0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 2, `z` is 2, `zero` is 1, `one` is 1, `lst` contains at least one index (e.g., [1]), `mini` is the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any index in `lst`, `final` is a list containing `elem`.**
