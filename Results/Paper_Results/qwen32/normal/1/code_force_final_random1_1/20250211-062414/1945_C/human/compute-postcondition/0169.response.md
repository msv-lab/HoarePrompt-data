To determine the new value of `one_perc`, we need to use the formula provided in the code snippet:

\[ \text{one\_perc} = (\text{o} - \text{one}) \times 100 \, // \, (\text{n} - \text{i} - 1) \]

Given the initial state:
- `o` is the count of '1' in `s`.
- `one` is 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` was not '0', otherwise `one` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 4.

Let's denote:
- \( o \) as the count of '1's in the string `s`.
- \( \text{one} \) as the value which is either 2 or 0 depending on whether the character at index `i` is not '0'.
- \( n \) as the length of the string `s`.
- \( i \) as the current index, which is 4.

The denominator in the formula is \( n - i - 1 \), which simplifies to \( n - 5 \).

Thus, the new value of `one_perc` is calculated as:

\[ \text{one\_perc} = (\text{o} - \text{one}) \times 100 \, // \, (n - 5) \]

Since the exact values of `o`, `one`, `n`, and `i` are not specified, we express the new value of `one_perc` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`final` is a sorted list; `n` is greater than 1; `t` has been decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', otherwise `zero` is 1; `one` is 2 if the character at index `i` in `s` was not '0', otherwise `one` is 0; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains empty; `mini` is 100000000; `zero_perc` is 40 if the character at index `i` in `s` was '0', otherwise `zero_perc` is 20; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 5)`; `i` is 4.**
