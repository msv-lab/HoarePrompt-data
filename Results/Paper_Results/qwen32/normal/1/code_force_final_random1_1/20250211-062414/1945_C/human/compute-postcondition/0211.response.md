Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, which is the number of test cases (an integer between 1 and 20,000), and for each test case, it accepts `n`, an integer between 3 and 300,000, and `a`, a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the string `a` for each test case.**
