Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `final` is a list, if the original length of `final` was 0, then `final` is [0] if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` is [n]; if the original length of `final` was not 0, then `final` remains [1, 3]; `n` is an input integer; `t` is 1 if the original length of `final` was not 0; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list; `mini` is 100000000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `final` is a list, if the original length of `final` was 0, then `final` is [0] if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` is [n]; if the original length of `final` was not 0, then `final` remains [1, 3]. `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1. `t` is 1 if the original length of `final` was not 0. `s` is the user's input. `pk` is `n / 2`. `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`. `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`. `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`. `zero` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0. `one` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0. `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains unchanged. `mini` is 100000000. `zero_perc` is either 0 or `100 // (i + 1)`. `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. Additionally, if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then these conditions hold true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `final` is a list, if the original length of `final` was 0, then `final` is [0] if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` is [n]; if the original length of `final` was not 0, then `final` remains [1, 3]. `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1; `t` is 1 if the original length of `final` was not 0; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` and `one` are counters updated based on the characters in `s`; `lst` is a list conditionally updated based on `zero_perc` and `one_perc` and includes `i + 1` if `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50`. `mini` is 100000000; `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`; `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `final` is a list, if the original length of `final` was 0, then `final` is [0] if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` is [n]; if the original length of `final` was not 0, then `final` remains [1, 3]. `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1; `t` is 1 if the original length of `final` was not 0; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` and `one` are counters updated based on the characters in `s`; `lst` is a list conditionally updated based on `zero_perc` and `one_perc` and includes `i + 1` if `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50`. If `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50`, `lst` also includes `i + 1`. `mini` is 100000000; `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`; `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
