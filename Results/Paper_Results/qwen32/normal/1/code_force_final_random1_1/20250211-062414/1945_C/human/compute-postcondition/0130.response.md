To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided information. The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst` and appends the element to the list `final` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the element is equal to `mini`.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `final` starts as an empty list.
   - `pk` is set to `n / 2`.
   - `lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50.
   - `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `elem` in `lst`, the loop checks if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.
   - If true, `elem` is appended to `final`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `final` will contain all elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.

Given the information about the first three iterations, it implies that the loop continues until all elements in `lst` have been processed. Therefore, the final state of `final` will include all elements from `lst` that satisfy the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.

**Output State: **`final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, `mini`) remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the final output state means that the `final` list will have all the indices from `lst` where the difference between `pk` and the index is the smallest possible value (`mini`). All other variables will retain their initial values as described in the problem statement.
