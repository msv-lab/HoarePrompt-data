Postcondition: **`final` is a list containing `elem` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. `n` is greater than 1; `t` has been decremented by 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in `s`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list containing indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were greater than or equal to 50 and must have at least one element; `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `abs(pk - elem) != mini`, `final` remains unchanged.**
