To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which is `i` in this case.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state was:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\)
- `n` is at least 2
- `s` is the string input provided by the user
- `pk` is set to `n / 2`
- `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`
- `mini` is 100000000
- `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 2`
- `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`
- `i` is 1
- If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is [2]. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.

Since the loop iterates over `range(n - 1)`, the loop variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value of 1, making it 2.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop's control structure.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is at least 2, `s` is the string input provided by the user, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `mini` is 100000000, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 2`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `i` is 2**
