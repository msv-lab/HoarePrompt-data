The provided code snippet only initializes an empty list named `final`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, `mini`) are modified or used in this snippet. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is the string input provided by the user, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `zero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[0:n-1]`, `one` is the count of '1's in the substring `s[0:n-1]`, `lst` is a list of indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50%, `mini` is the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any index in `lst`, `final` is an empty list.**
