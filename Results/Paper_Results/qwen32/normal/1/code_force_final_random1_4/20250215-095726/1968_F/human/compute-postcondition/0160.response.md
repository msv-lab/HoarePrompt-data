Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` and `data[2]` is an integer `q` that must be greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` must be a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*(q + 1) + 4 + n + 2 + 2`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4])` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is `int(data[idx - n + i - 7])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `results` is a list containing `q` strings, each either 'YES' or 'NO', determined by the conditions inside the loop for each iteration, plus five additional empty strings; `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values of `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`), where each key's value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key; `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`; `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the key `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`; `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the key `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`; `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order; `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. A new string 'YES' has been appended to `results`.**

In simple terms, the only change is that the string 'YES' has been added to the end of the `results` list, making it contain `q + 1` elements. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
