Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `a` of `n` integers and `q` queries. Each query specifies a subarray using indices `l` and `r` (1-based indexing). The function determines whether there exists a subarray within the specified range `[l, r]` whose XOR is zero and appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results based on this condition. After processing all test cases, it prints the results, separating them by newlines and inserting an empty line between results of different test cases.**
