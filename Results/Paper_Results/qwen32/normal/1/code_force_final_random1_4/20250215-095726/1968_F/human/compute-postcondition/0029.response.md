The code increments the value of `idx` by 1. Given the initial state, `idx` was 5, so after the increment, `idx` becomes 6.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer greater than or equal to 5; `idx` is 6; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 5; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[3]` which is the integer value of `data[3]`, `a[5]` which is the integer value of `data[4]`, and `a[6]` which is the integer value of `data[5]`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[3]` which is the integer value of `data[3]` and `pf[5]` which is the integer value of `data[4]`; `mp[data[3]]` is a list containing the integer 3; `mp[data[4]]` is a list containing the integers 3 and 5; `i` is 6.**
