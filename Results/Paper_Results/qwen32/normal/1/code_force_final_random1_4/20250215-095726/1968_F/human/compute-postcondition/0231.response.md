The code snippet provided increments the variable `idx` by 2. No other variables are modified in the given code. Therefore, we only need to update the value of `idx` in the output state.

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` that is at least 1, `data[2]` is an integer `q` that is greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` is a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 4*q + 2*n + 2 + n + 4`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[idx - 2 - n])` and is at least 1; `q` is `q - 1` and is greater than 0; `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`.

After executing `idx += 2`, the new value of `idx` is `idx + 2`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` that is at least 1, `data[2]` is an integer `q` that is greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` is a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 4*q + 2*n + 2 + n + 4 + 2`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[idx - 2 - n])` and is at least 1; `q` is `q - 1` and is greater than 0; `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`.**
