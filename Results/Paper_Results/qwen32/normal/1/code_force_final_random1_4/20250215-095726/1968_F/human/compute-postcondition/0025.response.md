Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer greater than or equal to 5; `idx` is 5; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 5; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[3]` which is the integer value of `data[3]` and `a[5]` which is the integer value of `data[4]`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[3]` which is the integer value of `data[3]` and `pf[5]` which is the integer value of `data[4]`; `mp[data[3]]` is a list containing the integer 3; if `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[data[4]]` is an empty list; `i` is 5.**
