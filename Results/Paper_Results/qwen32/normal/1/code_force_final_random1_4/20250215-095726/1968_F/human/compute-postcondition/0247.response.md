Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no direct parameters but processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a` and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The array `a` contains `n` integers, and each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r`. The function processes these queries and returns the result for each query, which is likely the sum or some aggregate of the elements in the subarray from index `l` to `r` (1-based indexing).**
