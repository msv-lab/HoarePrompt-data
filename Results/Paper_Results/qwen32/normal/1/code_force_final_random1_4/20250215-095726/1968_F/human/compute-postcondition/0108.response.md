The code snippet updates the value of `a[i]` to `int(data[idx])`. This means that the element at index `i` in the list `a` is now set to the integer value of the string located at index `idx` in the list `data`.

Given the initial state, the following variables remain unchanged except for `a[i]`:
- `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` and `data[2]` is an integer `q` that must be greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` must be a string representation of an integer that is at least 1.
- `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 4`.
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`.
- `q` is `int(data[n + 4])`.
- `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`.
- `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.
- `results` is a list containing `q` strings, each either 'YES' or 'NO', determined by the conditions inside the loop for each iteration, plus one additional empty string.
- `mp` is a dictionary with keys `0` and `pf[i]`, where the value for key `0` is a list containing only `0` and the value for key `pf[i]` is a list containing the elements `[i, i]` if `pf[i]` was not already in `mp`, otherwise it contains the previous elements plus `i`.
- `i` is `i + 1`

The only change is that `a[i]` is now `int(data[idx])`.
