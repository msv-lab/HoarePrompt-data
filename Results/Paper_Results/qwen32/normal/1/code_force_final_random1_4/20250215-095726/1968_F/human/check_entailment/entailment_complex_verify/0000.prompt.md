You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `a` of `n` integers and `q` queries. Each query specifies a subarray using indices `l` and `r` (1-based indexing). The function determines whether there exists a subarray within the specified range `[l, r]` whose XOR is zero and appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results based on this condition. After processing all test cases, it prints the results, separating them by newlines and inserting an empty line between results of different test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if a subarray can be divided into \( k > 1 \) parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.
- The program reads multiple test cases, each containing an array and several queries. For each query, it determines if the specified subarray is "interesting."

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and processes it line by line.
   - It initializes necessary data structures like prefix XOR arrays (`pf`) and a dictionary (`mp`) to store indices of prefix XOR values.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the prefix XOR up to that element and stores it in the `pf` array.
   - It also maintains a dictionary `mp` where keys are prefix XOR values and values are lists of indices where these prefix XOR values occur.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray from index `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR array.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is zero, it directly appends "YES" to the results because a subarray with XOR zero can always be split into any number of parts with XOR zero.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there exist indices in the prefix XOR array such that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR.

### Potential Issues:
- The logic for checking if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR seems to rely on the presence of certain prefix XOR values within the subarray.
- However, the current implementation might not correctly handle all cases where the subarray can indeed be split into parts with equal XOR.

### Specific Edge Case:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 2
1 4
```
- The XOR of the entire array `[1, 2, 3, 2]` is `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 2 = 0`, which means the array can be split into any number of parts with XOR zero.
- However, the program might not correctly identify this case due to the way it checks for the presence of prefix XOR values.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the problem and the need to ensure that the program handles all edge cases correctly, let's verify if the program fails for the above test case or any other potential edge case.

Let's run the provided code with the above test case to see if it produces the correct output.

### Running the Code with Test Case:
```python
import sys
import bisect

def func_1():
    data = """1
4 1
1 2 3 2
1 4""".split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        q = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        mp = {0: [0]}
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            if pf[i] not in mp:
                mp[pf[i]] = []
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[idx])
            r = int(data[idx + 1])
            idx += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
            v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
            it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l):
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        results.append('')
    print('\n'.join(results))

func_1()
```

### Output:
The output for the above test case is:
```
YES
```

This output is correct because the XOR of the entire array `[1, 2, 3, 2]` is zero, meaning it can be split into any number of parts with XOR zero.

### Final Verification:
After analyzing the program and verifying it with the specific test case, it appears that the program handles this edge case correctly. Given the complexity of the problem and the fact that the program correctly identifies the subarray as "interesting" in this case, it seems to be handling the problem requirements correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies whether a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR for the provided test case and seems to handle the problem requirements correctly based on the analysis.
