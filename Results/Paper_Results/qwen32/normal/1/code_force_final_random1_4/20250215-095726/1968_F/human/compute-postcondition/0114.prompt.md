Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` and `data[2]` is an integer `q` that must be greater than 0; `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 2`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `mp` is a dictionary with a single key `0` and value as a list containing only `0`; `results` is a list containing `q` strings, each either 'YES' or 'NO', determined by the conditions inside the loop for each iteration, plus one additional empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` and `data[2]` is an integer `q` that must be greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` must be a string representation of an integer that is at least 1, `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 3`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0, `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`, `q` is `int(data[n + 4])`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is now `a[i]`, `results` is a list containing `q` strings, each either 'YES' or 'NO', determined by the conditions inside the loop for each iteration, plus one additional empty string, `mp` is a dictionary with keys `0` and `pf[i]`, where the value for key `0` is a list containing only `0` and the value for key `pf[i]` is a list containing the single element `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` and `data[2]` is an integer `q` that must be greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` must be a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 4`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `results` is a list containing `q` strings, each either 'YES' or 'NO', determined by the conditions inside the loop for each iteration, plus one additional empty string; `mp` is a dictionary with keys `0` and `pf[i]`, where the value for key `0` is a list containing only `0` and the value for key `pf[i]` is a list containing the elements `[i, i]` if `pf[i]` was not already in `mp`, otherwise it contains the previous elements plus `i`; `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` and `data[2]` is an integer `q` that must be greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` must be a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 5`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `results` is a list containing `q` strings, each either 'YES' or 'NO', determined by the conditions inside the loop for each iteration, plus one additional empty string; `mp` is a dictionary with keys `0` and `pf[i]`, where the value for key `0` is a list containing only `0` and the value for key `pf[i]` is a list containing the elements `[i, i, i]` if `pf[i]` was already in `mp` before the append operation, otherwise it contains `[i, i]`; `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
