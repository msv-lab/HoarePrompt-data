Given the initial state and the line of code provided, we need to determine the new state after executing the line.

Initial State:
- `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `idx` is 4.
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`.
- `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[3]` which is the integer value of `data[3]`.
- `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `mp` is a dictionary with the key `0` mapping to the list `[0]`.

The line of code provided is:
```python
pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
```

Since `i` is not defined in the given initial state, we assume `i` is a variable that holds a specific value within the range of indices for the lists `pf` and `a`. Given that `pf` and `a` are lists of length `n + 1`, `i` must be between 0 and `n` inclusive.

For the sake of this example, let's assume `i` is 3 (since `a[3]` is specifically mentioned and `i` needs to be within the bounds of the lists).

So, the line of code becomes:
```python
pf[3] = pf[2] ^ a[3]
```

Given that `pf` is initially a list of `n + 1` zeros, `pf[2]` is 0. Also, `a[3]` is the integer value of `data[3]`.

Thus, `pf[3]` will be updated to `0 ^ data[3]`, which simplifies to `data[3]` because XORing any number with 0 results in the number itself.

Therefore, the updated state of `pf` will be:
- `pf[0]` remains 0
- `pf[1]` remains 0
- `pf[2]` remains 0
- `pf[3]` becomes `data[3]`
- `pf[i]` for `i > 3` remains 0

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 4, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[3]` which is the integer value of `data[3]`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[3]` which is the integer value of `data[3]`, `mp` is a dictionary with the key `0` mapping to the list `[0]`.**
