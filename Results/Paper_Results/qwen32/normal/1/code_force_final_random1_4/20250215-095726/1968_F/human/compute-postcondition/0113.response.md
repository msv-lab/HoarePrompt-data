The given code snippet appends the current index `i` to the list associated with the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`.

Given the initial state, the dictionary `mp` has keys `0` and `pf[i]`. The value for key `0` is a list containing only `0`, and the value for key `pf[i]` is a list containing `[i, i]` if `pf[i]` was not already in `mp`, otherwise it contains the previous elements plus `i`.

After executing `mp[pf[i]].append(i)`, the list associated with the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp` will have an additional element `i` appended to it.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` and `data[2]` is an integer `q` that must be greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` must be a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 5`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `results` is a list containing `q` strings, each either 'YES' or 'NO', determined by the conditions inside the loop for each iteration, plus one additional empty string; `mp` is a dictionary with keys `0` and `pf[i]`, where the value for key `0` is a list containing only `0` and the value for key `pf[i]` is a list containing the elements `[i, i, i]` if `pf[i]` was already in `mp` before the append operation, otherwise it contains `[i, i]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the list associated with the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp` now includes an additional element `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
