Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` that is at least 1, `data[2]` is an integer `q` that is greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` is a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 4*q + 2*n + 2 + n + 2`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[idx - 2 - n])` and is at least 1; `q` is `int(data[idx - 1 - n])` and is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the corresponding integer value from `data` starting from `idx - n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `results` is a list containing `q + 1` strings, the last of which is an empty string, and the others are each either 'YES' or 'NO'; `mp` is a dictionary where keys are unique XOR values from `pf` and values are lists of indices from `a` that produce these XOR values; `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]; r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]; x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]; v1` is the list of indices from `mp` associated with the key `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`; `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` associated with the key `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`; `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to maintain order; `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.** 

Explanation: The variable `it2` is calculated as `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
