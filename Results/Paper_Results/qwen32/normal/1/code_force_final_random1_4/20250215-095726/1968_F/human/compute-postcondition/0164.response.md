The given Python code snippet appends an empty string to the `results` list. This action modifies the `results` list by adding one more element to it, which is an empty string.

Here is the updated state of the variables:

- `data` remains unchanged as it is a list of strings with specific elements already defined.
- `idx` remains unchanged as it is calculated based on `n` and `q`.
- `t` remains unchanged as it is derived from `data[0]`.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is derived from `data[n + 3]`.
- `q` remains unchanged as it is derived from `data[n + 4]`.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is a list of integers derived from specific elements in `data`.
- `pf` remains unchanged as it is a list of cumulative XOR values derived from `a`.
- `results` now contains one additional element, which is an empty string.
- `mp` remains unchanged as it is a dictionary mapping unique values of `pf[i]` to lists of indices.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` and `data[2]` is an integer `q` that must be greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` must be a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 4*q + 2*n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4])` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is `int(data[idx - n + i - 2*q - 1])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `results` is a list containing `q + 1` strings, the last of which is an empty string, and the others are each either 'YES' or 'NO'; `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values of `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`), where each key's value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key.**
