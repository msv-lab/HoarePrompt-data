Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` and `data[2]` is an integer `q` that must be greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` must be a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*(q + 1) + 4 + n + 2`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4]) + 1` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is `int(data[idx - n + i - 5])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `results` is a list containing `q` strings, each either 'YES' or 'NO', determined by the conditions inside the loop for each iteration, plus two additional empty strings; `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values of `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`), where each key's value is a list of indices `i` for which `pf[i]` equals the key; `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`; `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` equals 0, `results` has an extra empty string appended to it; `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the key `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`; `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the key `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`; `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order; `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `x` equals 0, `results` has an extra empty string appended to it. Otherwise, the conditions inside the else block are met. `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the key `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`. `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the key `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`.**

In simple terms, the variable `v2` has been updated to be the list of indices from the dictionary `mp` corresponding to the key `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`. All other variables retain their previously defined values and conditions.
