The code appends an empty string to the `results` list. This means that the length of the `results` list increases by one, and the last element of the `results` list is now an empty string.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings; `n` is an integer; `q` is 0; `idx` points to the position right after the last pair of `l` and `r` processed; `t` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `pf` is a list of integers; `results` is a list of `q + 2` strings where the first `q` strings are either 'YES' or 'NO', the next string is an empty string, and the last is an empty string; `mp` is a dictionary.**
