Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` and `data[2]` is an integer `q` that must be greater than 0; `data[n + 3]` must be a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 4*q + 2*n + 2`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[idx - 2])`; `q` is `int(data[idx - 1])` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `results` is a list containing `q + 1` strings, the last of which is an empty string, and the others are each either 'YES' or 'NO'; `mp` is `{0: [0]}`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` that is at least 1, `data[2]` is an integer `q` that is greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` is a string representation of an integer that is at least 1, `idx` is `n + 3 + 4*q + 2*n + 3`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0, `n` is `int(data[idx - 3])` and is at least 1, `q` is `int(data[idx - 2])` and is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `results` is a list containing `q + 1` strings, the last of which is an empty string, and the others are each either 'YES' or 'NO', `mp[pf[i]]` is a list that includes `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` that is at least 1, `data[2]` is an integer `q` that is greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` is a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 4*q + 2*n + 4`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[idx - 4])` and is at least 1; `q` is `int(data[idx - 3])` and is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is now `int(data[idx - 2])` and also `a[n + 1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is now `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` and `pf[i - 1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 2])`; `results` is a list containing `q + 1` strings, the last of which is an empty string, and the others are each either 'YES' or 'NO'; `i` is `n + 1`. If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing `i`; otherwise, `mp[pf[i]]` is the original list with `i` appended.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is an integer `n` that is at least 1, `data[2]` is an integer `q` that is greater than 0, `data[n + 3]` is a string representation of an integer that is at least 1; `idx` is `n + 3 + 4*q + 2*n + 5`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is `int(data[idx - 5])` and is at least 1; `q` is `int(data[idx - 4])` and is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])` and `a[n + 1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 2])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is now `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` and `pf[i - 1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 3])`; `results` is a list containing `q + 1` strings, the last of which is an empty string, and the others are each either 'YES' or 'NO'; `i` is `n`; `mp[pf[n]]` is a list that includes `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
