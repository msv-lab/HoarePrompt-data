You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

    #This is printed: Each result from the test cases, separated by newlines, with an empty line between results of different test cases
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `a` of `n` integers and `q` queries. Each query specifies a subarray using indices `l` and `r` (1-based indexing). The function determines whether there exists a subarray within the specified range `[l, r]` whose XOR is zero and appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results based on this condition. After processing all test cases, it prints the results, separating them by newlines and inserting an empty line between results of different test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine if a subarray can be divided into more than one segment such that the bitwise XOR of each segment is the same.

### Solution Approach:
1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix XOR (`pf`) for the array. `pf[i]` represents the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`.
   
2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**: It uses a dictionary `mp` to map each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this prefix XOR occurs.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query defined by `l` and `r`, it computes the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the prefix XOR values: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
   - If `x` is `0`, it means the entire subarray has a zero XOR, which implies it can be trivially split into any number of segments with zero XOR.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there exists an index `j` between `l` and `r` such that the XOR of the subarray `a[l:j]` equals the XOR of the subarray `a[j+1:r+1]`. This is done by checking if there is an index in the list `mp[pf[r]]` that is greater than or equal to `l` and an index in the list `mp[pf[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Prefix XOR Calculation**: This is correctly implemented. The prefix XOR array `pf` is computed such that `pf[i]` holds the XOR of elements from the start up to index `i`.
- **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**: The dictionary `mp` correctly maps each prefix XOR value to the indices where it occurs.
- **Query Handling**:
  - **Zero XOR Case**: If `x = 0`, the subarray can be split into any number of segments with zero XOR, which is handled correctly.
  - **Non-Zero XOR Case**: The program checks for the existence of an index `j` that divides the subarray into two parts with equal XOR. The use of binary search (`bisect_left`) ensures efficient lookup of indices within the lists stored in `mp`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if a subarray can be split into segments with equal XOR. The use of prefix XOR and efficient indexing through a dictionary and binary search ensures that the solution is both correct and efficient.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
