To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
```

This means the loop will iterate over the variable `y` starting from `max_p - 1` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by `1` each time.

Given the provided state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the range function has valid parameters for the loop to execute. Specifically, `max_p - 1` should be greater than or equal to `1` for the loop to run at least once.

Let's analyze the given state:

- `custo` is 120
- `custos` is [50, 90, 120]
- `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`
- `x` remains unchanged
- `num_fila` is 5
- `max_p` is 2
- `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
- `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 55]
- `nf` is a list of substrings from the input
- `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input
- `b` is a list of substrings from the new input

The only variables in the loop head are `y` and the parameters of the `range` function, which are `max_p - 1`, `0`, and `-1`. Since `max_p` is given as `2`, `max_p - 1` equals `1`, which means the loop will execute once with `y` being `1`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute, as `max_p` is already set such that `max_p - 1` is greater than `0`.

State: **`custo` is 120, `custos` is [50, 90, 120], `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 55], `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input, and `b` is a list of substrings from the new input**
