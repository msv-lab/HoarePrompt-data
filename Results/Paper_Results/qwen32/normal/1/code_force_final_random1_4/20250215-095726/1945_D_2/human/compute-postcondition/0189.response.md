Output State: **`custo` is 120 + `a_values[y]`; `custos` is [50, 90, 120]; `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`; `x` remains unchanged; `num_fila` is 5; `max_p` is 2; `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]; `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 55]; `nf` is a list of substrings from the input; `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input; `b` is a list of substrings from the new input. Additionally, `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
