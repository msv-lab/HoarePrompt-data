Postcondition: **`custo` is either `custo + a_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, or `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is greater than or equal to `b_values[y]`. `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition. `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `a_values` is `[int(y1), int(y2), ..., int(yn)]` where `y1, y2, ..., yn` are the elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integer values from `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input, and `b` is a list of substrings from the new input.**
