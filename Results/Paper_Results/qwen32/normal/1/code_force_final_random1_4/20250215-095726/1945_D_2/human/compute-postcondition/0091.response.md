Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer read from the input minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer read from the input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input, `v` is `v_end - 2`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
