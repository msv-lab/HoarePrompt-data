Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (with `m` â‰¤ `n`), and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. It calculates a cost for each test case based on specific conditions involving elements from the lists `a` and `b`, and prints the calculated cost for each test case.**
