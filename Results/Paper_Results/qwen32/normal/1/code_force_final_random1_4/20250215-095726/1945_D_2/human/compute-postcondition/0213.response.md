To determine what will be printed by the `print(c)` statement, we need to carefully examine the initial state provided and see if there is any mention of the variable `c`.

Here is the initial state provided:
- `custo` is 140
- `custos` is [50, 90, 120, 140]
- `i` is 3
- `x` remains unchanged (its value is not specified)
- `num_fila` is 5
- `max_p` is 2
- `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
- `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 55]

From the above initial state, we can see that the variable `c` is not mentioned or defined. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the value of `c` based on the given information.

Since the variable `c` is not defined in the initial state, attempting to print `c` would result in a `NameError` because Python does not recognize `c` as a defined variable.

However, since the task specifically asks for what will be printed and not for error handling, and since there's no indication that `c` should be defined by any formula or condition from the given information, we must conclude that the value of `c` cannot be determined.

Given this, the most precise description we can provide is that the variable `c` is undefined based on the provided initial state.

Output: **c (where c is an undefined variable)**

But since the task specifies to provide the most precise description possible and considering the context of the task, the appropriate response should indicate that the variable is not defined:

Output: **NameError: name 'c' is not defined**
