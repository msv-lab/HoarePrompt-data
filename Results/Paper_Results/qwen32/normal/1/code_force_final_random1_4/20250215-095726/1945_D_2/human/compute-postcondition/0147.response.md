The code assigns the integer value of the first element of the list `nf` to the variable `num_fila`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`custo` is 0; `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition, including the newly appended value; `i` is `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`; `x` remains unchanged; `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`; `max_p` is 0; `a_values` is an empty list; `b_values` is an empty list; `nf` is a list of substrings from the input; `a` remains unchanged; `b` remains unchanged.**
