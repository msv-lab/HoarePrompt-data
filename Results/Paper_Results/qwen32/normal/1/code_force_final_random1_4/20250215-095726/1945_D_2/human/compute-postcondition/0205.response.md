Output State: **`custo` is 190, `custos` remains `[50, 90, 120]`, `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` remains 5, `max_p` remains 2, `a_values` remains `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, `b_values` remains `[15, 25, 35, 45, 55]`, `nf` remains a list of substrings from the input, `a` remains a list of substrings obtained from the new input, `b` remains a list of substrings from the new input`, and `y` is 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
