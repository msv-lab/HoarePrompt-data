The given loop iterates over the list `custos` and prints each element. Since the loop does not modify any of the variables in the initial state except for printing the elements of `custos`, the values of `custo`, `i`, `x`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, and `b_values` will remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop.

The loop will execute 4 times because there are 4 elements in the `custos` list. After the loop completes all its iterations, the state of the variables will be the same as the initial state except for the fact that all elements of `custos` will have been printed.

Output State: **custo is 140, custos is [50, 90, 120, 140], i is 3, x remains unchanged, num_fila is 5, max_p is 2, a_values is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], b_values is [15, 25, 35, 45, 55]**

In simple terms, after the loop has printed all the elements of the `custos` list, none of the variable values have changed from their initial state.
