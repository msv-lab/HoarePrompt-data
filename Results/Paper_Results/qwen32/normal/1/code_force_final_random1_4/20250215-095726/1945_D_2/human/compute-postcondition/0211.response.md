To determine what will be printed by the `print(c)` statement, we need to carefully examine the initial state provided and identify if there is any mention of a variable named `c`. 

From the initial state, we have the following information:
- `custo` is 140
- `custos` is [50, 90, 120, 140]
- `i` is 3
- `x` remains unchanged (its value is not specified)
- `num_fila` is 5
- `max_p` is 2
- `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
- `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 55]

However, there is no mention of a variable named `c` in the provided initial state. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the value of `c` based on the given information.

Given this situation, the most precise description we can provide is that the variable `c` is undefined within the context of the provided initial state.

Output: **c (where c is undefined based on the provided initial state)**
