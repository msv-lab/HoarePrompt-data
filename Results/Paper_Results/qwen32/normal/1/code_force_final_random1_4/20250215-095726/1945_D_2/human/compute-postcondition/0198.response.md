Postcondition: **`custo` is 175 if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` (which evaluates to `20 + 25 <= 20` being false, thus making `custo` 160). `custos` remains `[50, 90, 120]`, `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` remains 5, `max_p` remains 2, `a_values` remains `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, `b_values` remains `[15, 25, 35, 45, 55]`, `nf` remains a list of substrings from the input, `a` remains a list of substrings obtained from the new input, `b` remains a list of substrings from the new input`, and `y` remains 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement in both cases.**
