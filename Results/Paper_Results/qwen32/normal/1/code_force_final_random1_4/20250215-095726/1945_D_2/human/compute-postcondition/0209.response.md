To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information and the behavior of the loop.

### Understanding the Loop Behavior

1. **Loop Iteration Details**:
   - The loop runs `x` times.
   - In each iteration, it reads `num_fila` and `max_p`.
   - It then reads two lists `a_values` and `b_values`.
   - It calculates `custo` based on the conditions provided in the loop.
   - `custo` is appended to the `custos` list.

2. **Given Information**:
   - After 3 iterations, the `custos` list is `[50, 90, 120, 140]`.
   - The last value of `custo` after 3 iterations is `140`.
   - The values of `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, and `b_values` are provided as `5`, `2`, `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, and `[15, 25, 35, 45, 55]` respectively.

### Determining the Final Output State

Since the problem does not specify the exact number of iterations `x`, we assume that the given `custos` list represents all the iterations that were performed. Therefore, the final `custos` list will be `[50, 90, 120, 140]`.

### Final Output State

- `custo` will be the last value in the `custos` list, which is `140`.
- `custos` will be `[50, 90, 120, 140]`.
- `i` will be equal to `x` since the loop runs `x` times.
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, and `b_values` will be the values from the last iteration, which are `5`, `2`, `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, and `[15, 25, 35, 45, 55]` respectively.

### Final Answer

Output State: **custo is 140, custos is [50, 90, 120, 140], i is 3, x remains unchanged, num_fila is 5, max_p is 2, a_values is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], b_values is [15, 25, 35, 45, 55].**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop, the final cost (`custo`) is 140, and the list of accumulated costs (`custos`) is `[50, 90, 120, 140]`. The loop has run 3 times (`i` is 3), and the values of `x`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, and `b_values` remain as specified in the last iteration.
