To determine what will be printed by the `print(best)` statement, let's break down the given initial state:

- `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `na_frente` to 0. This means it is the cumulative minimum cost starting from index `na_frente` and going backwards to index 0.
- `best` is the minimum cost encountered when moving from `na_frente` to `pos_final` (inclusive) plus the cost of switching to `a` at that point. This implies that `best` is the result of evaluating the minimum cost path from `na_frente` to `pos_final` and adding the switching cost at the point where this minimum occurs.

Given this, the `print(best)` statement will output the value of `best`, which is described as the minimum cost from `na_frente` to `pos_final` inclusive, plus the cost of switching to `a` at the optimal point along this path.

Since the exact values of `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and the costs involved are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `best`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output precisely.

Output: **best (where best is the minimum cost from `na_frente` to `pos_final` inclusive, plus the cost of switching to `a` at the optimal point along this path)**
