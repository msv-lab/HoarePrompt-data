Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. The logic for calculating the total cost and determining the best cost is flawed. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the fact that Kirill can choose to swap with any person in front of him, not just the immediate one, and it does not correctly handle the costs associated with passing through multiple people during a swap.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program incorrectly adds costs based on whether `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. This approach does not consider the optimal path Kirill should take to minimize his total cost.

2. **Ignoring Multiple Swaps**: Kirill can swap with any person in front of him, not just the immediate one. The current implementation only considers swapping with the immediate person, which may not yield the minimum cost.

3. **Best Cost Determination**: The program updates the `best` cost based on the current total cost plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, but this does not necessarily reflect the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` positions.

To solve this problem correctly, a dynamic programming approach or a greedy strategy that considers all possible swaps and their associated costs would be needed. The program should evaluate all possible ways Kirill can move to a position within the first `m` positions and choose the one with the minimum cost.
