The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final`. The values of `t`, `cases`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `c` is 0; `na_frente` and `pos_final` are integers read from input.**
