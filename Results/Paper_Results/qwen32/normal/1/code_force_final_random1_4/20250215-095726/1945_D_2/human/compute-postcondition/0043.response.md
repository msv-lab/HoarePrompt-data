The code snippet provided updates the value of `total` by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it. Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `cases` remains an integer read from input and must be greater than 0.
- `n` and `m` remain integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
- `a` remains a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `b` remains a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
- `c` remains 0.
- `na_frente` remains at least 1.
- `pos_final` remains an integer read from input minus 1.
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains a list of integers read from input.
- `custo_pra_passar_b` remains a list of integers read from input.
- `v` remains `na_frente - 3`.
- `total` is now `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `c` is 0; `na_frente` is at least 1; `pos_final` is an integer read from input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input; `v` is `na_frente - 3`; `total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
