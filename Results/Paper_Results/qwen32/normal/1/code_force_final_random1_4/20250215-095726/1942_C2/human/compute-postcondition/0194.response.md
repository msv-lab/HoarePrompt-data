The code snippet `ans += 2 * y` increments the variable `ans` by twice the value of `y`. Since `y` remains the same as it was before the decrement, we need to account for its current value in the calculation.

Given that `ans` remains the same as it was before the increment, and `y` remains the same as it was before the decrement, the new value of `ans` will be its old value plus `2 * y`.

Output State: **`2x - 2` remains unchanged, `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even that must contain at least one more element, `n` remains the first value provided in the input, `x` remains the second value provided in the input, `t` remains the same as it was before the decrement, `a` remains the same as it was before the modification, `st` remains the same as it was before the update, `ans` is now `ans + 2 * y`, `y` remains the same as it was before the decrement, `gap` is the next element in the `even` list**.
