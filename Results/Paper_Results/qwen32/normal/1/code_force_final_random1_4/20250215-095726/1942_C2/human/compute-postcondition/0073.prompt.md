Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is the newly read sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to `len(a)` indicating the loop has completed. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, then `ans` is the final value after all iterations plus 1. Otherwise, `ans` is the final value after all iterations, and if the condition `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)` is true, then `ans` is incremented by `(a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]) // 2`, `tmp` includes the new value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is decremented by `((a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]) // 2 - 1)`. `tmp` is a list of values `(a[i] - a[i-1]) // 2` that met the second condition. `ans` is now `x + y - 2`, `ii` is `tt - 1 + 1 = tt`. `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values read from the input. `a` is the sorted list of integers. `tmp` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 1, `ans` is the final value after all iterations (if applicable). If the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of `a` is 2, `ans` is incremented by 1. If the difference is not 2, `ans` remains unchanged unless `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, in which case `ans` is incremented by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` contains one element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is reduced by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `ans`, `tmp`, and `y` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 2, and `ans` is the final value after all iterations (if applicable). If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[2] - a[1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is increased by `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, `tmp` contains `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, and `y` is updated to `y - ((a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1)`. If neither condition is met, `ans`, `tmp`, and `y` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, and `i` is 3. If `a[3] - a[2] == 2`, then `ans` is the final value after all iterations plus 1. Otherwise, if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `tmp` and `y` is updated to `y - ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
