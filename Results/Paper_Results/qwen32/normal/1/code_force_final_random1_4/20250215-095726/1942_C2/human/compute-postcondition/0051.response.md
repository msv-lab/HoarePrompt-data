Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 1, `ans` is the final value after all iterations (if applicable) and has been incremented by 1, `tmp` is an empty list, and the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of `a` is 2.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that the value of `ans` has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
