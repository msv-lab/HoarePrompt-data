Postcondition: **`2x - 2` remains unchanged, `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd and must contain at least one element, `even` contains all gaps greater than 0 and even (now sorted), `n` remains the first value provided in the input, `x` remains the second value provided in the input, `t` is decremented by `x`, `a` remains a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`, `st` remains a set containing unique elements from the modified list `a`. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `y` is now 0 and `ans` is now `ans + gap_current + 2 * y`; otherwise, `y` is now `y - gap_current // 2` and `ans` is now `ans + gap_current`. `gap` is `gap_next`.**
