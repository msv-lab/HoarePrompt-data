The value of `ans` is calculated as `x + y - 2`. The other variables (`t`, `tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `tt` must be greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `ans` is `x + y - 2`.**
