### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic and verify if the program correctly handles the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - It reads the list `a` of `k` integers representing the positions of the signs and prepends `0` to it.
   - It reads the list `b` of `k` integers representing the times the car arrives at these signs and prepends `0` to it.

2. **Distance and Time Differences Calculation:**
   - It calculates the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and stores them in `ad`.
   - It calculates the differences between consecutive elements in `b` and stores them in `bd`.

3. **Speed Calculation:**
   - It calculates the speed for each segment between consecutive signs and stores them in `v`. Speed is calculated as the distance divided by the time taken for that segment.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `d`, it finds the segment in which `d` lies using binary search (`bisect_left`).
   - If `d` exactly matches one of the known positions in `a`, it directly returns the corresponding time from `b`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time taken to reach `d` by adding the time taken to reach the previous sign and the additional time to travel the remaining distance within the current segment.

5. **Output:**
   - The results for all queries in a test case are printed on a single line separated by spaces.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program against the first example provided:

#### Test Case 1:
```
10 1 3
10
10
0
6
7
```

- `a = [0, 10]`
- `b = [0, 10]`
- `ad = [0, 10]`
- `bd = [0, 10]`
- `v = [0, 1.0]`

For queries:
- `d = 0`: Directly returns `b[0] = 0`
- `d = 6`: Lies in the segment `[0, 10]`. Time = `b[0] + (6 - a[0]) * v[1] = 0 + 6 * 1.0 = 6`
- `d = 7`: Lies in the segment `[0, 10]`. Time = `b[0] + (7 - a[0]) * v[1] = 0 + 7 * 1.0 = 7`

Output: `0 6 7` which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:

After verifying the logic and checking it against the provided example, the program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and produce the expected results.

**Correctness: True**
