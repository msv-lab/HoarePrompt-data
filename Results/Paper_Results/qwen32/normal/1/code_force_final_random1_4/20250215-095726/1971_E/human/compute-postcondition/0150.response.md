To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `len(b)`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state was:
- `i` is 1
- `b` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` with at least 2 elements
- `bd` contains one element `[b[1] - b[0]]`

In the loop head, `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2 (since it was 1 at the end of the previous iteration).

The length of `b` (`len(b)`) remains unchanged throughout the iterations unless modified within the loop body, which is not shown here. Since the loop condition is `i in range(1, len(b))`, for the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `len(b)`.

Given that `b` has at least 2 elements, `len(b)` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 2, and `len(b)` should remain at least 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 2, `b` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` with at least 2 elements, `bd` contains one element `[b[1] - b[0]]`**
