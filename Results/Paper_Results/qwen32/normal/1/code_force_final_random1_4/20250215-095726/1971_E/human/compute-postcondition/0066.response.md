Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input such that `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `k` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k > 0`; `q` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `k+1` integers where `a_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, `a_i` < `a_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, and `a_k` = `n`; `b` is a list of `k+1` integers where `b_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `b_i` < `b_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`; `ad` is a list containing `k+1` elements `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1]]`; `bd` is a list containing `k+1` elements `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1]]`; `v` is a list containing `k+1` elements `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k]]`; `l` is `q-1`; `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`; `i` is 1; `ql` is the newly read integer input minus `a[s - 1]`; `s` is the index in `a` where `ql` would be inserted to maintain sorted order. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, then `a[s]` is confirmed to be equal to `ql`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.`**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all `q` iterations, the state of the variables will be as follows:
- The loop variable `l` will be `q-1`, indicating that the last iteration has been completed.
- The variable `m` will hold the computed value based on the last `ql` input, which is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`.
- The variable `ql` will be the last integer input minus `a[s - 1]`.
- The variable `s` will be the index in the list `a` where `ql` would be inserted to maintain sorted order.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, and `i`) will remain unchanged from their initial state or as they were at the end of the previous iteration, except for `l` and `m` which reflect the final iteration's computation.
