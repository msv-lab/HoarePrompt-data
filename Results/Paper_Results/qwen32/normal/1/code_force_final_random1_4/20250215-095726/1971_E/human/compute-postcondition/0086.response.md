The code appends the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is initially `i + 1`, the value of `i` remains unchanged by the operation itself, but the list `bd` is updated.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `bd` has a new element which is `b[i] - b[i - 1]` appended to it.**
