Postcondition: **`t` is t-1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a new list [0] + list(map(int, input().split())), `b` is a new list [0] + list(map(int, input().split())), `ad` is [0] + [a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(a))], `bd` is [0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))], `v` is [0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))], `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is the newly read integer input, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` without breaking the order, and `a[s]` is equal to `ql`.**
