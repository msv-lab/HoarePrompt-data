The only variable in the loop head is `l`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and `q`. If `l` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1, and `q` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` should be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `q` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`i` is 1, `bd` is `[0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))]`, `v` is `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`, `q` is greater than 0, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the insertion point of `ql` in `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, then `a[s]` remains equal to `ql`, `l` is 2**
