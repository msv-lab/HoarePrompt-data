Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `k` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, `a_i` < `a_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k-1`, and `a_k` = `n`; `b` is a list of `k` integers where 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `b_i` < `b_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k-1`. There are `q` queries, each query `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `d` ≤ `n`. The sum of `k` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of an integer input, which is between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and the queries `d`) remain unchanged as they have not been modified by the provided code snippet.
