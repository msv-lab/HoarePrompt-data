Output State: **`t` is t-1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a new list [0] + list(map(int, input().split())), `b` is a new list [0] + list(map(int, input().split())), `ad` is [0] + [a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(a))], `bd` is [0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))], `v` is [0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))], `l` is 0, `m` is `m` + `b[s - 1]` + `bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `ql` is the newly read integer input minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` without breaking the order. Additionally, if `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, then `a[s]` remains equal to `ql`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding the product of `bd[s]`, `ql`, and the reciprocal of `ad[s]` to its previous value. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
