The only variable in the loop head is `l`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `l` is less than `q`.

At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `q` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `b` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `ad` is `[0] + [a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(a))]`, `bd` is `[0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))]`, `v` is `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`, `l` is 2, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` without breaking the order.**
