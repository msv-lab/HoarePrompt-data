Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, and `q`, along with two lists `a` and `b` of length `k`, and `q` queries `d`. For each query `d`, it calculates and prints a value based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`.**
