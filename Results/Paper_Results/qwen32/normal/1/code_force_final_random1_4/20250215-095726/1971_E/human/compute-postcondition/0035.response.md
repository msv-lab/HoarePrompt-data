To determine what will be printed by the `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `a` is a list of `k+1` integers where `a_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, `a_i` < `a_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, and `a_k` = `n`.
   - `b` is a list of `k+1` integers where `b_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `b_i` < `b_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`.
   - `ql` is an input integer.
   - `s` is the index in `a` where `ql` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, but it is given that `a[s]` is equal to `ql`.

2. **Implications:**
   - Since `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, this means `ql` is one of the elements in the list `a`.
   - The index `s` is such that `a[s] = ql`.

3. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement will print the element at index `s` of the list `b`.

Given that `a[s] = ql` and `s` is the index where `ql` is found in `a`, the value printed will be `b[s]`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `b[s]`, where `s` is the index in the list `a` such that `a[s] = ql`.

Output: **b[s] (where s is the index in the list a such that a[s] = ql)**
