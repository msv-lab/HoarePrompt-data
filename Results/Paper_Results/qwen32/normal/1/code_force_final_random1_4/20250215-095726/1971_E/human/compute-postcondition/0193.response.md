To determine what will be printed by the `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`i`**: This variable is set to 1.
2. **`bd`**: This list is constructed as `[0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))]`. This means the first element is 0, and subsequent elements are the differences between consecutive elements of the list `b`.
3. **`v`**: This list is constructed as `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`. This means the first element is 0, and subsequent elements are the division of corresponding elements from lists `ad` and `bd`.
4. **`q`**: This variable is greater than 0.
5. **`m`**: This variable is set to 0.
6. **`ql`**: This variable is set to the integer value from user input.
7. **`s`**: This variable is the new insertion point of `ql` in `a` found by `bisect_left(a, ql)`. This means `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` without disrupting the order.
8. **`l`**: This variable is set to 2.

### Relevant Code Analysis:
The specific line we are interested in is `print(b[s], end=' ')`. This line prints the element at index `s` of the list `b`.

### Determining the Output:
- **`s`**: This is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`, which means it is the position in the list `a` where `ql` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`.
- **`b[s]`**: This is the element in the list `b` at the index determined by `s`.

Since the exact contents of the list `b` and the value of `ql` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `b[s]`. However, we know that `b[s]` refers to the element in `b` at the position where `ql` would fit into the sorted list `a`.

### Final Output:
Given the information provided, the most precise description of what will be printed is:

Output: **b[s] (where s is the insertion point of ql in the sorted list a)**
