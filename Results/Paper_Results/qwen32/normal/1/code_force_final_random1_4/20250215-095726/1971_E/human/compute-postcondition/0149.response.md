The code appends the difference between the current element `b[i]` and the previous element `b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input. After executing the code, `bd` will have one element which is `b[1] - b[0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `b` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` with at least 2 elements, `bd` contains one element `[b[1] - b[0]]`**.
