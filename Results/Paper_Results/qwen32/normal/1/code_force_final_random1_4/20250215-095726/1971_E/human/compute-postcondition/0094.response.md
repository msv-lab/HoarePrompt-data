Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `q` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a new list with at least two elements (e.g., `[0, some_integer]`), `b` is a new list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `ad` is `[0] + [a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(a))]`, `bd` is `[0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))]`, `v` is `[0, ad[i] / bd[i], ad[i] / bd[i], ad[i] / bd[i]]`, `l` is `q-1`, `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`, `i` is `len(a)`, `ql` is the newly read integer input minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` needs to be recalculated based on the new `a` and `ql`.**

Explanation: The variable `v` has been updated to include an additional element, which is `ad[i] / bd[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
