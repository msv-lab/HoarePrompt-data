The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `q`. This affects the values of these variables, but does not change the definitions or constraints of the other variables.

Here's the updated state:

- `n` is now the first integer read from the input.
- `k` is now the second integer read from the input.
- `q` is now the third integer read from the input.
- All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `l`, `m`, `i`, `ql`, `s`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `q` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a list of `k+1` integers where `a_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, `a_i` < `a_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, and `a_k` = `n`; `b` is a list of `k+1` integers where `b_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `b_i` < `b_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`; `ad` is a list containing `k+1` elements `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1]]`; `bd` is a list containing `k+1` elements `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1]]`; `v` is a list containing `k+1` elements `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k]]`; `l` is `q-1`; `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`; `i` is 1; `ql` is the newly read integer input minus `a[s - 1]`; `s` is the index in `a` where `ql` would be inserted to maintain sorted order. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, then `a[s]` is confirmed to be equal to `ql`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
