Output State: **`i` is 1, `bd` is `[0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))]`, `v` is `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`, `q` is greater than 0, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the insertion point of `ql` in `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, then `a[s]` remains equal to `ql`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `m` has been updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
