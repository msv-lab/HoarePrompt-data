The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(a)`, meaning `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `len(a)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, let's call it `i_prev`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Given the loop condition `for i in range(1, len(a))`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `len(a)`.

From the problem description, we know that `a` is a list of `k+1` integers. Hence, `len(a)` is `k+1`. The loop will run from `i=1` to `i=k` (inclusive).

So, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was `i_prev`, then at the start of the next iteration `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Since the problem does not provide the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `i` should simply be incremented by 1 to start the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input such that `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `k` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5 and `k > 0`; `q` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `k+1` integers where `a_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, `a_i` < `a_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, and `a_k` = `n`; `b` is a list of `k+1` integers where `b_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `b_i` < `b_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`; `ad` is a list containing two elements `[0, a[i] - a[i-1]]`; `bd` is a list containing a single element `0`; `i` is `i + 1`**
