To determine the output of the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the calculations involved in determining the value of `m`.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Inputs and Initializations**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4).
   - `n`: An integer such that `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9.
   - `k`: An integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5.
   - `q`: Number of queries (1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5).
   - `a`: A list of `k+1` integers where `a_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, `a_i` < `a_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`, and `a_k` = `n`.
   - `b`: A list of `k+1` integers where `b_0` = 0, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `b_i` < `b_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`.
   - `ad`: Differences between consecutive elements of `a`, i.e., `ad[i] = a[i] - a[i-1]`.
   - `bd`: Differences between consecutive elements of `b`, i.e., `bd[i] = b[i] - b[i-1]`.
   - `v`: Ratios of corresponding elements of `ad` and `bd`, i.e., `v[i] = ad[i] / bd[i]`.
   - `l`: Initialized to 1.
   - `s`: Index in `a` where `ql` would be inserted to maintain sorted order.
   - `ql`: Newly read integer input minus `a[s - 1]`.
   - `m`: Calculated as `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`.

2. **Calculation of `m`**:
   - `s` is determined by finding the position in `a` where `ql` would fit, maintaining the sorted order.
   - `m` is calculated using the formula: `m = b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`.

### Explanation of the Print Statement:
The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement prints the integer part of `m` followed by a space.

### Output Description:
Given the above steps and the initial state, the value of `m` is computed based on the specific values of `b`, `bd`, `ad`, and `ql`. Since the exact values of these variables are not provided, we can only describe the calculation process and the final result in terms of these variables.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s]))**
