To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables from Input:**
   - `n`: First integer read from the input.
   - `k`: Second integer read from the input.
   - `a`: A list starting with `0` followed by integers read from the input.
   - `b`: A list starting with `0` followed by integers read from the input.

2. **Derived Variables:**
   - `ad`: A list starting with `0` followed by differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
     - `ad[i] = a[i] - a[i - 1]` for `i` from `1` to `len(a) - 1`.
   - `bd`: A list starting with `0` followed by differences between consecutive elements of `b`.
     - `bd[i] = b[i] - b[i - 1]` for `i` from `1` to `len(b) - 1`.
   - `v`: A list starting with `0` followed by the ratio of corresponding elements of `ad` and `bd`.
     - `v[i] = ad[i] / bd[i]` for `i` from `1` to `len(a) - 1`.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `q`: An integer greater than or equal to `1`.
   - `l`: Set to `2`.
   - `s`: The index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` without breaking the order.
   - `ql`: A newly read integer minus `a[s - 1]`.
   - `m`: Calculated as `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`.
   - `i`: Set to `1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int(m), end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The value of `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`.
- To find the exact value printed, we need to know the values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]`.

### Detailed Calculation:
- `b[s - 1]`: This is the element in list `b` just before the position where `ql` fits in list `a`.
- `bd[s]`: This is the difference between `b[s]` and `b[s - 1]`.
- `ql`: This is the newly read integer minus `a[s - 1]`.
- `ad[s]`: This is the difference between `a[s]` and `a[s - 1]`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, the lists `a` and `b`, and the newly read integer are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

### Final Output Description:
The `print` statement will output the integer value of `m`, which is calculated as `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s]))**
