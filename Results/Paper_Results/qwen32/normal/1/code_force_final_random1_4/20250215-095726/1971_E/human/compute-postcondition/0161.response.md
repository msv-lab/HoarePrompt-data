The code appends the value `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Given that `i` is 3, the new element added to `v` will be `ad[3] / bd[3]`.

Therefore, the updated list `v` will be `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ad[3] / bd[3]]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `a` must have at least three elements, `bd` is `[0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))]`, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ad[3] / bd[3]]`**.
