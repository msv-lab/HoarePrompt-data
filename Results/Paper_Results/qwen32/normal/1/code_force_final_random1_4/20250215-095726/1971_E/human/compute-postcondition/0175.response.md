To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the relationships between the variables:

1. **Variable `i`**: It is explicitly set to 1.
2. **List `bd`**: It is constructed as `[0] + [b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(b))]`. This means `bd` starts with a 0 followed by the differences between consecutive elements of list `b`.
3. **List `v`**: It is constructed as `[0] + [ad[i] / bd[i] for i in range(1, len(a))]`. This means `v` starts with a 0 followed by the ratios of corresponding elements from lists `ad` and `bd`.
4. **Variable `q`**: It is mentioned to be greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
5. **Variable `m`**: It is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
6. **Variable `ql`**: It is initially some value and is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
7. **Variable `s`**: It is the insertion point of `ql` in list `a`. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, it remains unchanged.

Given these definitions, let's focus on the expression for `m`:

\[ m = b[s - 1] + \frac{bd[s] \times ql}{ad[s]} \]

To find the exact value of `m`, we need to know the values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]`. Since the specific values of `b`, `ad`, and `ql` are not provided, we cannot compute a numerical value for `m`.

However, we can describe `m` in terms of the given variables and their relationships:

- `b[s - 1]`: The element in list `b` just before the insertion point `s`.
- `bd[s]`: The difference between the `s`-th and `(s-1)`-th elements of list `b`.
- `ql`: The value after being adjusted by subtracting `a[s - 1]`.
- `ad[s]`: The `s`-th element of list `ad`.

Thus, the print statement will output the integer part of `m` based on these components.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql) / ad[s])**
