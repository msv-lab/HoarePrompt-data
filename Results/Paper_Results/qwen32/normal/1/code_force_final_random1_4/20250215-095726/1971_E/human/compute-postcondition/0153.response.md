The code appends the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is 3, the new element added to `bd` will be `b[3] - b[2]`.

Therefore, the updated `bd` will contain three elements: `[b[1], b[2] - b[1], b[3] - b[2]]`.

The values of `i` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `b` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` with at least 3 elements, `bd` contains `[b[1], b[2] - b[1], b[3] - b[2]]`**
