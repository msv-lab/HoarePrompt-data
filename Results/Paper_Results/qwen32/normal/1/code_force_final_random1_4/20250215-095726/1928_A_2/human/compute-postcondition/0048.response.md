Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `a1` and `a2` are each `a // 2` if `a` is even; `b1` and `b2` remain unchanged unless `b` is even, in which case `b1` and `b2` are each `b // 2`. If `b` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`, there are no changes to `t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, or `b1`.**
