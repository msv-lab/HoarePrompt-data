Output State: **All test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the program has printed 'Yes' if at least one of the numbers was even and could be split into two equal parts that were not equal to the other number, otherwise it printed 'No'. The variable `t` is now 0.**

In natural language: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the program has checked each pair of numbers (`a` and `b`) for each of the `t` test cases. For each pair, it determined if at least one number was even and could be split into two equal parts that were not equal to the other number. If so, it printed 'Yes'; otherwise, it printed 'No'. The variable `t`, which initially represented the number of test cases, is now 0 because all test cases have been processed.
