Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers a and b such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
        print('yes')
    elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
        print('no')
    elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. If both `a` and `b` are even, then no changes are made to `a` or `b`. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd. If `a - b == -a`, then `a` remains unchanged. If `b - a == -b`, then `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `2a` is not equal to `b` and `2b` is not equal to `a`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the difference between `a` and `b` is non-zero. If `a` is equal to `b`, then the difference between `a` and `b` is zero.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If both `a` and `b` are even, the behavior is as described in the if part (which is not detailed here). Otherwise, `t` retains its value within the specified range, `a` and `b` retain their input values, and `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1. If both `a` and `b` are even, the values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `a`, and `b` also remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
