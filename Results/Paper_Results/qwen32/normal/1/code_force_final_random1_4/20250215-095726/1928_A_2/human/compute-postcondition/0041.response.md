The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables in the given context. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration in a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there is no loop structure provided in the code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect here.

Therefore, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `a1` is `a // 2`; `a2` is `a // 2`; `b1` and `b2` remain unchanged.**
