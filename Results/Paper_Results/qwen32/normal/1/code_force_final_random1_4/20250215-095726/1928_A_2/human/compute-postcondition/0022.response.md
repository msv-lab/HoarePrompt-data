Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Regardless of whether the condition `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is true or false, `t` retains its value within the specified range, `a` and `b` retain their input values, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
