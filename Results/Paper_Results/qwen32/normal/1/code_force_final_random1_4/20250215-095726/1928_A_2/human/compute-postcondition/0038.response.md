The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. No further changes are made to the variables `t`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` in the given code snippet. Therefore, the only updated variables are `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` remain unchanged.**
