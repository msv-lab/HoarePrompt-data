The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables; it only affects the flow of control in loops by skipping the rest of the current iteration and moving to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the provided context, the `continue` statement has no effect here.

Thus, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, and `b1`, `b2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `a1` and `a2` are each `a // 2` if `a` is even; `b1` and `b2` are each `b // 2`.**
