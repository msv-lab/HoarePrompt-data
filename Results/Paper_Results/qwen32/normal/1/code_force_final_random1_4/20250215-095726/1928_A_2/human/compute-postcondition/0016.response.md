The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the input provided.

Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. However, since the code snippet does not modify `t` or `i`, only `a` and `b` are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

Natural Language: The values of `a` and `b` are now set to the integers provided in the input. The value of `t` remains the same, and `i` is incremented by 1. All other conditions regarding the parity of `a` and `b` and their relationships remain as described in the initial state.
