Let's analyze the given if condition and determine the negation that would lead us to the else block.

The if condition is:
```
if ((a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0):
```

This condition checks whether `(a - b) % 2` is either greater than 0 or less than 0. Essentially, this means that `(a - b)` is not equal to 0. 

The negation of this condition would be that `(a - b) % 2` is not greater than 0 and not less than 0, which means `(a - b) % 2` must be equal to 0. Therefore, `(a - b)` must be 0.

Now, we can formulate the postcondition:

Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. At least one of `a` or `b` is odd. Additionally, `2a` is not equal to `b` and `2b` is not equal to `a`. Furthermore, `a` is equal to `b`.**
