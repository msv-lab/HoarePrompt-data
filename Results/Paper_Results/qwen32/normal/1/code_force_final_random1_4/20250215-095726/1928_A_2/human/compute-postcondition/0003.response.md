The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'yes'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is described as an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. The variables `a` and `b` are described as even integers read from the input.
3. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'yes'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `t`, `a`, or `b`, the output is solely determined by the content of the `print` statement itself.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **yes**
