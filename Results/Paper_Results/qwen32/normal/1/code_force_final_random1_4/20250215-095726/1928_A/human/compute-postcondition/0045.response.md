Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\).
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `a1` and `a2` are each `a // 2` if `a` is even.
- `b1` and `b2` are each `b // 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, or `b2`. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'` without any modifications or dependencies on the variables, the output will be:

Output: **Yes**
