To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions and the provided outputs for the first three iterations.

Here's the loop code again for reference:
```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
        print('yes')
    elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
        print('no')
    elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')
```

### Analysis of the Loop:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
- It checks the following conditions:
  - If both `a` and `b` are even, it prints 'yes'.
  - If either `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is true, it prints 'no'. However, this condition seems to be incorrectly formatted and likely should be checking `a - b == -a` or `b - a == -b`.
  - If the difference `(a - b)` is non-zero (either positive or negative), it prints 'yes'.
  - Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

### Simplified Conditions:
- If both `a` and `b` are even, it prints 'yes'.
- If `a - b == -a` or `b - a == -b`, it prints 'no'.
- If `a` is not equal to `b`, it prints 'yes'.
- If `a` equals `b`, it prints 'no'.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the variable `i` will have reached `t`, meaning the loop has completed all `t` iterations. The values of `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers read from the input, but they do not affect the overall state of the program since they are re-read for each iteration.

Thus, the final output state is simply that the loop has completed all `t` iterations, and the program has printed the appropriate 'yes' or 'no' for each pair of integers.

Output State: **The loop has completed all `t` iterations, and the program has printed the appropriate 'yes' or 'no' for each pair of integers.**
