Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- At least one of `a` or `b` is odd.
- `2a` is not equal to `b` and `2b` is not equal to `a`.
- The difference between `a` and `b` is not zero, meaning `(a - b) % 2` is either greater than 0 or less than 0.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('yes')` statement simply outputs the string `'yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`. The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement because it does not reference these variables.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
