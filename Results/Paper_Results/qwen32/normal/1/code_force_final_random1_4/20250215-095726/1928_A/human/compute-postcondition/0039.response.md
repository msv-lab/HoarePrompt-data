The code assigns the value of `a // 2` to both `a1` and `a2`. The variables `t`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are mentioned in the initial state, but only `a1` and `a2` are modified by the code.

Since `a` is an integer read from the input, `a // 2` will perform integer division, resulting in the floor division of `a` by 2. This means `a1` and `a2` will both hold the value of `a // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `a1` is `a // 2`; `a2` is `a // 2`; `b1` and `b2` remain unchanged.**
