Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet directly outputs the string `'yes'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. The value of these variables does not influence the output of the `print` statement.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'yes'`, the output will always be `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
