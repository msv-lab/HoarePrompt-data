The code reads two integers from the input, splits them, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the next input operation will return `t`. However, the provided code snippet does not use `t` and instead focuses on reading two new integers for `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
