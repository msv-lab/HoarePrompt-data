Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:

Bob can form a new rectangle from the two smaller rectangles he gets after cutting the original rectangle if and only if at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle is even. Here's why:

- If both dimensions `a` and `b` are odd, cutting the rectangle will result in two smaller rectangles with at least one dimension being 1, which cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle different from the original.
- If either `a` or `b` is even, we can always cut the rectangle in such a way that we get two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

### Program Analysis:

Let's go through the code and see if it correctly implements this logic:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Issues in the Code:

1. **Condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`**:
   - This condition is syntactically incorrect and does not make logical sense. It seems like an attempt to check if `a` and `b` are equal, but the tuple construction `(a - b == -a, a)` is not a valid way to do that.
   
2. **Condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`**:
   - This condition checks if `a` and `b` are not equal, but it does not correctly determine if a new rectangle can be formed. It should instead check if at least one of `a` or `b` is even.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program should simply check if either `a` or `b` is even and print 'yes' if true, otherwise print 'no'.

### Correct Implementation:

A correct implementation would look something like this:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified in the provided code, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
