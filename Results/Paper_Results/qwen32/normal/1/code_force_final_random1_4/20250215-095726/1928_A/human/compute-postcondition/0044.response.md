The code assigns `b1` and `b2` the value of `b // 2`. This means both `b1` and `b2` will now hold the integer division result of `b` by 2. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `a1`, `a2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\); `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `a1` and `a2` are each `a // 2` if `a` is even; `b1` and `b2` are each `b // 2`.**
