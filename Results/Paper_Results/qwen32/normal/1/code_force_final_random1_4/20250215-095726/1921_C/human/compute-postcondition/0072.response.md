Postcondition: **`test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `n-1`, and `array2` contains elements `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. Additionally, if the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, then the condition holds true; otherwise, the sum is greater than or equal to `f`.**
