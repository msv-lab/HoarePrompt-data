The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components based on spaces, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a new list called `arr`. This operation does not affect the previously defined variables `i`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, or `b`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `n` is `feat[0]`; `f` is `feat[1]`; `a` is `feat[2]`; `b` is `feat[-1]`; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.**
