Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains four integers n, f, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9. The second line contains n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
