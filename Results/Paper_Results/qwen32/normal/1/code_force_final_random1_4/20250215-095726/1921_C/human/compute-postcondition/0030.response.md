The given code snippet assigns the last element of the list `feat` to the variable `b`. This means that the value of `b` is updated to be the last element of the `feat` list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `array2` is a list containing `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, `i` is incremented by 1**. 

In simpler terms, the value of `b` has been updated to the last element of the `feat` list, while all other variables retain their original values.
