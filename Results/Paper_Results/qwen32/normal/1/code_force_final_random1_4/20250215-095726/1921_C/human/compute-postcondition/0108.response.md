Postcondition: **`array2` is a list of numbers, `n` is an integer, `b` is a number, and `f` is a number. If the sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, the sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.**
