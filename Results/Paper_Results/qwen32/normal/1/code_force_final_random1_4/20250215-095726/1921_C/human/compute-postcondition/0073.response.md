Output State: **After all iterations, `test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, and for each test case, the program has evaluated whether the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`. If true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".**

In simpler terms, after processing all the test cases, the program will have printed "Yes" or "No" for each one based on the specified condition. The values of `test_cases` and `t` stay the same throughout the process, while `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, and `array2` are recalculated for each test case.
