Postcondition: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, and `i` is 1. Since the if condition (`i == 0`) is false, the else part is executed. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains one element `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged (potentially empty).**
