Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- It is specified that `n` is not equal to `m`, and `m` is greater than `n`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'No'`. The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it does not reference any of these variables. The statement is hardcoded to print `'No'`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided initial state and the code snippet, the output will be:

Output: **No**
