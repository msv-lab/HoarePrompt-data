The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`) but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'Yes'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is described as an input integer within the range 1 to 100.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to 1.
3. The variable `n` is the first integer from the input.
4. The variable `m` is the second integer from the input.

However, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. It directly prints the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
