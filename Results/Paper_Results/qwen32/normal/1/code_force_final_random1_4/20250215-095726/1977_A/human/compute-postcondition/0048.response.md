Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `m` is the second integer from the input. Regardless of whether `m` is greater than `n`, `m` equals `n - 1`, or any other relationship between `m` and `n`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.**
