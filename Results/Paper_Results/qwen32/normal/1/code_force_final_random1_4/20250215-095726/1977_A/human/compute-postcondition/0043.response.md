Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Output:
Based on the analysis, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **Yes**
