To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Each move consists of either adding or removing exactly 1 cube.
- Output "Yes" if it's possible, otherwise "No".

### Key Observations:
1. **Parity Consideration**: Since each move changes the number of cubes by exactly 1, the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes will alternate with each move.
   - If you start with 0 cubes (even), after an odd number of moves, you'll have an odd number of cubes, and after an even number of moves, you'll have an even number of cubes.
   - Similarly, if you start with 1 cube (odd), after an odd number of moves, you'll have an even number of cubes, and after an even number of moves, you'll have an odd number of cubes.
2. **Range of Possible Values**: The number of cubes after `n` moves can range from `max(0, n - m)` to `n + m` (but practically, it ranges from `max(0, n - m)` to `n` because we cannot have more cubes than the number of moves).

### Evaluation of the Program Logic:
The program uses the following conditions:
1. If `n == m`, it prints "Yes".
2. If `m > n`, it prints "No".
3. If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes".
4. If both `m` and `n` are even, it prints "Yes".
5. If both `m` and `n` are odd, it prints "Yes".
6. Otherwise, it prints "No".

Let's analyze these conditions:
- **Condition 1 (`n == m`)**: Correct. If `n` moves result in `m` cubes, and `n == m`, it means all moves were additions, which is possible.
- **Condition 2 (`m > n`)**: Correct. If `m > n`, it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves since each move adds or removes exactly 1 cube.
- **Condition 3 (`m == n - 1`)**: Correct. If `m == n - 1`, it means one move was a removal and the rest were additions, which is possible.
- **Conditions 4 and 5 (both `m` and `n` are even/odd)**: Incorrect. These conditions do not cover all valid scenarios. For example, if `n = 4` and `m = 2`, both `n` and `m` are even, but the program would print "Yes" even though `m` could be reached by alternating additions and removals (e.g., add, add, remove, remove).
- **Default Case**: Incorrectly handles cases where the parity condition is not met but the number of cubes is reachable.

### Counterexample:
Consider `n = 4` and `m = 2`:
- The program will print "Yes" because both `n` and `m` are even.
- However, to reach 2 cubes from 0 cubes in 4 moves, a valid sequence could be: add, add, remove, remove.
- This scenario is valid, and the program should print "Yes". But the current logic incorrectly handles this due to the parity check alone.

### Correct Conditions:
1. If `n == m`, print "Yes".
2. If `m > n`, print "No".
3. If `abs(n - m) % 2 == 0`, print "Yes" (this covers the parity condition and the range of possible values).
4. Otherwise, print "No".

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of parity and the range of possible values.

**Final: False**
