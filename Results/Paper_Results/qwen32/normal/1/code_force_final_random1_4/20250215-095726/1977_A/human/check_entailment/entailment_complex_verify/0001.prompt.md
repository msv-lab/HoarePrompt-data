You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is `t - 1`, and for each of the `t` test cases, the program has printed 'Yes' or 'No' based on the conditions provided in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on specific conditions related to the parity and values of `n` and `m`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
Nikita starts with an empty tower and can perform two types of operations:
- Add one cube to the tower.
- Remove one cube from the tower.

We need to determine if, after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.

### Key Observations:
1. **Parity (Odd/Even Nature)**: 
   - Adding or removing one cube changes the parity of the number of cubes.
   - If we start with 0 cubes (even), after an even number of moves, we will still have an even number of cubes. After an odd number of moves, we will have an odd number of cubes.
   - The same logic applies if we start with an odd number of cubes.

2. **Constraints**:
   - We can add up to `n` cubes if we only perform addition operations.
   - We can remove up to `n` cubes if we only perform removal operations, but we cannot remove more cubes than we have added previously.

### Conditions for "Yes":
- If `m` is within the range `[0, n]` and the parities of `m` and `n` match (both odd or both even), then it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the conditions in the provided code:

1. **if n == m**: This condition checks if the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes. This is a special case where adding one cube `n` times results in `m` cubes. This is correct.

2. **elif m > n**: This condition checks if the desired number of cubes is greater than the number of moves. Since we can only add one cube per move, this is impossible. This is correct.

3. **elif m == n - 1**: This condition checks if the desired number of cubes is one less than the number of moves. This could be achieved by adding `n-1` cubes and removing one cube. This is correct.

4. **elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0**: This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are even. If they are, it is possible to reach `m` cubes after `n` moves because we can balance additions and removals to maintain the parity. This is correct.

5. **elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0**: This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are odd. Similar to the previous case, maintaining the parity is possible. This is correct.

6. **else**: If none of the above conditions are met, the answer is "No". This covers all other scenarios where achieving `m` cubes after `n` moves is not possible.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the necessary conditions to determine if it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the parity and the constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
