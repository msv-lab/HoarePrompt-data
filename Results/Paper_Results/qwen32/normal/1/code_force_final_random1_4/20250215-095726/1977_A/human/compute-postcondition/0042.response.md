The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 100.
- `i` is explicitly set to 2.
- `n` and `m` are the first and second integers from the input, respectively.

However, since the `print` statement only outputs the string `'Yes'`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` do not influence the printed result.

Output: **Yes**
