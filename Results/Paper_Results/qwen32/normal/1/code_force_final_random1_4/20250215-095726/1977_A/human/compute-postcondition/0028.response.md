Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'Yes'`, the output will always be `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **Yes**
