Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input. If both `m` and `n` are even, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` also remain unchanged.**
