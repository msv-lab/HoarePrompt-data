### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program and see if it correctly determines whether it's possible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

The key points to consider are:
- Each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.
- The initial number of cubes in the tower is zero.

Thus, after `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can be any integer between `-n` and `n`, inclusive, but since we cannot have a negative number of cubes, the possible number of cubes is between `0` and `n`.

To achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the following conditions must hold:
1. `m` must be between `0` and `n` inclusive.
2. If `m` is greater than `n`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes we can have is `n`.
3. If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, it's possible to have `m` cubes if the difference `n - m` is even. This is because we need an even number of moves to balance out the additions and subtractions to reach exactly `m` cubes.

Now let's look at the provided code and see if it adheres to these conditions:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

- The first condition (`if n == m`) is correct; if `n` equals `m`, it's trivially possible.
- The second condition (`elif m > n`) is also correct; if `m` is greater than `n`, it's impossible.
- The third condition (`elif m == n - 1`) is not necessarily correct. It should be checked if `n - m` is even, not just if `m == n - 1`.
- The fourth and fifth conditions check the parity of `m` and `n`. However, they do not fully cover all cases where `n - m` is even.

The correct logic should be:
- If `m > n`, print 'No'.
- Otherwise, check if `n - m` is even. If it is, print 'Yes'; otherwise, print 'No'.

The current code does not correctly handle all cases where `n - m` is even, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.

### Example Analysis:
- For the input `2 4`, the code incorrectly prints 'No'. The correct answer is 'No' because `n - m = 2 - 4 = -2` which is even, but the code does not handle this correctly.
- For the input `5 3`, the code correctly prints 'Yes' because `n - m = 5 - 3 = 2` which is even.

### Conclusion:
The program is not entirely correct due to the incorrect handling of cases where `n - m` is even.

### Correctness: **False**
