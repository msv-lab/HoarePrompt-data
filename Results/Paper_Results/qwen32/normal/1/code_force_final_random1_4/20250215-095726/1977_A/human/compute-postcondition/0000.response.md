Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is reassigned to the value of the integer input. The constraints on `t` remain the same, and the description about `n` and `m` for each test case is still valid as no changes have been made to them yet.
