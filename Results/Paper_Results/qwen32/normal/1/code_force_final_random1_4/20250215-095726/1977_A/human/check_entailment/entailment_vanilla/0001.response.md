Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
Nikita starts with an empty tower and can perform two types of operations:
- Add one cube to the tower.
- Remove one cube from the tower.

We need to determine if, after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.

### Key Observations:
1. **Parity (Odd/Even Nature)**: 
   - Adding or removing one cube changes the parity of the number of cubes.
   - If we start with 0 cubes (even), after an even number of moves, we will still have an even number of cubes. After an odd number of moves, we will have an odd number of cubes.
   - The same logic applies if we start with an odd number of cubes.

2. **Constraints**:
   - We can add up to `n` cubes if we only perform addition operations.
   - We can remove up to `n` cubes if we only perform removal operations, but we cannot remove more cubes than we have added previously.

### Conditions for "Yes":
- If `m` is within the range `[0, n]` and the parities of `m` and `n` match (both odd or both even), then it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the conditions in the provided code:

1. **if n == m**: This condition checks if the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes. This is a special case where adding one cube `n` times results in `m` cubes. This is correct.

2. **elif m > n**: This condition checks if the desired number of cubes is greater than the number of moves. Since we can only add one cube per move, this is impossible. This is correct.

3. **elif m == n - 1**: This condition checks if the desired number of cubes is one less than the number of moves. This could be achieved by adding `n-1` cubes and removing one cube. This is correct.

4. **elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0**: This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are even. If they are, it is possible to reach `m` cubes after `n` moves because we can balance additions and removals to maintain the parity. This is correct.

5. **elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0**: This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are odd. Similar to the previous case, maintaining the parity is possible. This is correct.

6. **else**: If none of the above conditions are met, the answer is "No". This covers all other scenarios where achieving `m` cubes after `n` moves is not possible.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the necessary conditions to determine if it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the parity and the constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
