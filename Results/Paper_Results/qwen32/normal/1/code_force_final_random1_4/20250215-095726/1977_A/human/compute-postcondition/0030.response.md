The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`) but these do not affect the `print` statement in the code snippet. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100. This represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it is not used in the provided code snippet.
2. `i` is initialized to 1. This variable could be used in a loop, but it is not referenced in the provided code snippet.
3. `n` is the first integer from the input. This variable is not used in the provided code snippet.
4. `m` is the second integer from the input. This variable is also not used in the provided code snippet.

The `print('Yes')` statement does not depend on any of these variables; it directly prints the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **Yes**
