The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates over the range defined by `t`, meaning `i` will increment by 1 each time the loop runs until it reaches `t`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.

The conditions involving `n` and `m` do not affect the loop control variable `i` directly. Therefore, we only need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

Since `i` is currently 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 to 2, assuming `t` is at least 2. If `t` is 1, the loop will not execute again, and `i` remains 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input.**
