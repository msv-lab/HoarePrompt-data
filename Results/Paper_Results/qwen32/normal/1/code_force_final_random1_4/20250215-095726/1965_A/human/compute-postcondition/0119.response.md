Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `i` is `i + 1`. If 1 is not in `lis` or `lis` has a length of 1, the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, `lis` has either an odd or even length, `j` is set to `len(lis) - 1`, and `test` is True.**
