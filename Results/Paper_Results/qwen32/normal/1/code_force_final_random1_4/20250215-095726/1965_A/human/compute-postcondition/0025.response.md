The code snippet `A = not A` flips the boolean value of `A`. If `A` was `True`, it becomes `False`; if `A` was `False`, it becomes `True`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `A`. The other variables (`arr`, `set_`, and `not_c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is unchanged, `A` is `False` if it was `True` or `True` if it was `False`, `set_` is the sorted version of `arr`, and `not_c` is `True`. No difference greater than 1 was found in `arr`.**
