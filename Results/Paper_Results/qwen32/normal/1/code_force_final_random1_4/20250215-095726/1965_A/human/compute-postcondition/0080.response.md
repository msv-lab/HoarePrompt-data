Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, then the conditions remain as they are. Otherwise, `lis` contains the integer 1 and has a length greater than 1, and `test` is `True`. `i` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `lis` has at least 4 elements, its length is either odd or even.**
