Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is another input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must contain more than one element.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `j` is `j + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bob')
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bob'`. The variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, and `j` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will simply output the string `'Bob'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Bob**
