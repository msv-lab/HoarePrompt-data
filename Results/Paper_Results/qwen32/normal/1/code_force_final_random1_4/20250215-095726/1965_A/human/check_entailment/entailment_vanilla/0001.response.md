Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The game described is a variant of the Nim game, where players take turns removing a positive integer number of stones from each non-empty pile, with the constraint that the number of stones removed from each pile must be the same. The player who cannot make a move loses.

The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the game's state and the optimal moves. The game can be analyzed using the concept of Grundy numbers (or Nimbers), but for this specific problem, we can use a simpler observation:

- If all piles have the same number of stones, the first player (Alice) can always mirror the second player's (Bob's) moves and win.
- If the piles do not all have the same number of stones, the game can be reduced to a series of smaller games, and the winner depends on the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones after reducing the game to its simplest form.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program:

```python
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())
c = 1
while t > 0:
    n = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    r = func_1(arr)
    print(r)
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    if arr[0] != 1:
        return 'Alice'
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        A = not A
    if not_c:
        A = not A
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The program incorrectly determines the winner based on the first element of the array and the sorted unique elements of the array. This logic does not correctly reflect the rules of the game.
   - The program does not correctly handle the condition where all piles have the same number of stones.
   - The program does not correctly handle the condition where the piles do not all have the same number of stones and needs to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where all piles have the same number of stones.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the piles do not all have the same number of stones and needs to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the program, it is clear that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
