Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that contains the integer 1 and has a length greater than 1, `j` is `j + 2`, `test` is `False`.**

Explanation: The variable `test` is explicitly set to `False` by the given code snippet. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, and `j`) remain unchanged as per the provided initial state and the code snippet.
