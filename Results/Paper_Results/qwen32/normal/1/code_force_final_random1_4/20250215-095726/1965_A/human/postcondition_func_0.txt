The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input, where the first element `t` indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function determines the winner of a game based on the conditions described in the code and returns 'Alice' or 'Bob'. Specifically, it returns 'Alice' if the first element of `arr` is not 1, or if a certain condition involving the sorted unique elements of `arr` is met; otherwise, it returns 'Bob'.
