Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 4 elements; `i` is incremented by 1; `test` is `True`. The length of `lis` is even.**
