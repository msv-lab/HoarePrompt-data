Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that contains the integer 1 and has a length greater than 1, `j` is `j + 2`. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, `test` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `test` remains unchanged.**
