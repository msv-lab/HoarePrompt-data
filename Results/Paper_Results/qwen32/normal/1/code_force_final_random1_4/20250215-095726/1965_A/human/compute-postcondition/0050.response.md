Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements; `i` is incremented by 1; `test` is `True`. The current value of `j` satisfies the condition that `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1` and `j` is odd.**
