Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must contain more than one element; `i` is `i + 1`; `test` is False; `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`. Additionally, `j` is either an odd integer or an even integer.**

In simple terms, the only change is that the variable `test` has been set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
