The given code snippet only modifies the variable `A`. The variable `A` is initially set to `False`, and the line `A = not A` toggles its value to `True`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `arr` remains a list of integers with more than one element.
- `A` is now `True`.
- `set_` remains a sorted version of `arr` with more than one element.
- `i` remains 3.
- The condition involving `not_c` is not affected because the code does not modify `not_c` or any other variable related to that condition.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with more than one element, `A` is True, `set_` is a sorted version of `arr` with more than one element, `i` is 3. If `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, then `not_c` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `not_c` remains unchanged.**
