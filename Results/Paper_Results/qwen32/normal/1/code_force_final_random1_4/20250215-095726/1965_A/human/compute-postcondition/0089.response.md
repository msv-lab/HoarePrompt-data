Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must contain more than one element; `i` is `i + 1`; `test` is True; `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`. Additionally, `j` is an odd integer.**
