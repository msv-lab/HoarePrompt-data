Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must contain more than one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`. Regardless of whether `j % 2 == 1` is true or false, the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, and `j` remain consistent with their respective preconditions, with `i` and `j` each incremented by 1.**
