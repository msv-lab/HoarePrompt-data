The provided initial state describes several variables and objects (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, `j`) but does not specify their exact values or how they are related to the `print` statement. The `print` statement itself is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables or objects.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer input with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is another integer input.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must contain more than one element.
- `i` and `j` are incremented by 1, but their initial values are not specified.

Despite the presence of these variables and objects, the `print` statement only outputs the string `'Bob'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
