The code snippet `A = not A` flips the boolean value of `A`. Given that the initial state specifies `A` is False, after executing this line, `A` will be True.

Other variables (`arr`, `set_`, and `not_c`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with more than one element, `A` is True, `set_` is a sorted version of `arr` with more than one element, `not_c` is False if the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element in `set_` is greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True.**
