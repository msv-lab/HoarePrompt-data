Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and `test` is False.**

Explanation: The variable `test` is explicitly set to `False`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged in terms of their descriptions and conditions.
