To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `j`.

Given the loop:
```python
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 (this does not change as it's not part of the loop head).
- `n` is the new input integer (this does not change as it's not part of the loop head).
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input (this does not change as it's not part of the loop head).
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements (this does not change as it's not part of the loop head).
- `i` is incremented by 1 (this does not change as it's not part of the loop head).
- `j` is incremented by 1 (this changes as it is part of the loop head).
- `test` is set to False if `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`; otherwise, `test` remains unchanged (this does not change as it's not part of the loop head).

Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Let's assume at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value `k`. At the start of the next iteration, `j` would be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is `j + 1`, and `test` is set to False if `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`; otherwise, `test` remains unchanged.**

Since we don't know the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we express the state in terms of the incremented `j`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and `test` is set to False if `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`; otherwise, `test` remains unchanged.**

To be more specific, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is `k + 1`, and `test` is set to False if `lis[k + 1] - lis[k] > 1`; otherwise, `test` remains unchanged.**

However, since we are not given the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, the most accurate general form is:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and `test` is set to False if `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`; otherwise, `test` remains unchanged.**
