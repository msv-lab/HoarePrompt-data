Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must contain more than one element, `i` is `i + 1`, and `j` is `j + 1`. The value of `j` determines whether the if or else part was executed, but the state of all other variables remains unchanged regardless of whether `j` is odd or even.**
