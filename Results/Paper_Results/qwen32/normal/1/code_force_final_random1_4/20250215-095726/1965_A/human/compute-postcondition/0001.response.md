Postcondition: **arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and t is not equal to 1. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5; A is False.**
