The code snippet `p = j` assigns the value of `j` to `p`. Therefore, `p` now holds the same value as `j`.

Output State: **`s` is a list of integers from the input with the first element swapped with the element at index `k-1`, `j` is the number of elements processed minus 1, `p` is the number of elements processed minus 1, `ans1` is the count of elements equal to `h` (with `s[0] != h` condition met) plus elements less than or equal to `h` after the first match, `z` is 1 if any element equal to `h` was found, `n` and `k` are the values from the input, `t` is unchanged, and `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`.**
