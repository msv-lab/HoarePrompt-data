Output State: **`s` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `s` and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
