The value of `j` is explicitly set to `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is -1, `p` is equal to `j`, `ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` and meet the conditions specified in the loop, `z` is 1 if any element in `s[1:]` was equal to `h` and `s[0]` was not equal to `h`, otherwise it is 0, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `s` is a list where the first element and the element at index `k-1` have been swapped, `ans` is 0, `h` is equal to `s[0]`.**
