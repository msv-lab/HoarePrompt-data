Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a list `a` as input, which contains test cases. Each test case includes two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` unique integers representing cow ratings. The function determines and returns an integer based on the ratings relative to the cow at index `k`. The return value can be `n - 1`, `k - 1`, or a calculated value based on the indices of cows with higher ratings compared to the cow at index `k`.**
