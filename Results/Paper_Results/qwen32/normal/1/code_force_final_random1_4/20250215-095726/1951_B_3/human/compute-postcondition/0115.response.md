The code snippet `ans1 += 1` increments the value of `ans1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a list with at least one element.
- `j` is `len(s) - 2`.
- `p` is `len(s) - 2`.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `ans` is `len(s) - 1`.
- `h` is equal to `s[0]`.
- `i` is the element at position `len(s) - 1` in the list `s`.
- `ans1` is determined based on the conditions provided, and `z` is set accordingly.

After executing `ans1 += 1`, the value of `ans1` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`s` is a list with at least one element, `j` is `len(s) - 2`, `p` is `len(s) - 2`, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `ans` is `len(s) - 1`, `h` is equal to `s[0]`, `i` is the element at position `len(s) - 1` in the list `s`, `ans1` is increased by 1.**
