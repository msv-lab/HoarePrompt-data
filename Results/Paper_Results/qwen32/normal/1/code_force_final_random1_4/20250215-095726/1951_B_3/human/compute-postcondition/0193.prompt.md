Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a list of integers from the input with the elements at indices `p` and `k-1` swapped, `j` is the number of elements processed minus 1, `p` is the number of elements processed minus 1, `ans1` is 0, `z` is 0, `n` and `k` are the values from the input, `t` is unchanged, and `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a list of integers from the input with at least one element, `j` is the number of elements processed minus 1, `p` is the number of elements processed minus 1, `n` and `k` are the values from the input, `t` is unchanged, and `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`. If `i` equals `h`, `z` is 1 and `ans1` is 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`. If `i` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a list of integers from the input with at least one element, `j` is the number of elements processed, `p` is the number of elements processed, `n` and `k` are the values from the input, `t` is unchanged, and `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`. If `i` equals `h`, `z` is set to 1 and `ans1` is incremented by 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`. If `i` does not equal `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is incremented by 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a list of integers from the input with at least one element, `j` is the number of elements processed, `p` is the number of elements processed, `n` and `k` are the values from the input, `t` is unchanged, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`, `i` is the (j+1)-th element of `s`. If `i == h`, no changes are made to `ans1` or `z`. If `i > h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i <= h` and `z == 1`, `ans1` is incremented by 1. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1 and `z` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
