In the given initial state, the variable `k` is explicitly set to 14. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet attempts to print the variable `ind`.

Since there is no information provided about the variable `ind` in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, based on the given information, it is impossible to predict what will be printed when the `print(ind)` statement is executed.

However, if we assume that the variable `ind` is not defined anywhere in the code or the initial state, this would result in a `NameError` during execution.

Given the task requirements, we must provide the most precise description possible based on the precondition. Since `ind` is not mentioned in the initial state, we can only conclude that its value is unknown from the provided information.

Output: **ind (where ind is an undefined variable)**
