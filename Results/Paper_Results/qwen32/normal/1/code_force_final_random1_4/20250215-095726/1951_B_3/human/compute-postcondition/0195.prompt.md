Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each of the following t test cases consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The second line contains n distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans = 0
    h = s[0]
    j = -1
    for i in s[1:]:
        j += 1
        if h < i:
            break
        else:
            ans += 1
    p = j
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans1 = 0
    s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
    z = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == h:
            if s[0] != h:
                ans1 += 1
            z = 1
        elif i > h:
            break
        elif z == 1:
            ans1 += 1
    print(max(ans, ans1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is the index of the last element checked minus one, `p` is equal to `j`, `ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` and meet the conditions specified in the loop, `z` is 1 if any element in `s[1:]` was equal to `h` and `s[0]` was not equal to `h`, otherwise it is 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is `len(s) - 2`, `p` is `len(s) - 2`, `ans1` is the count of elements equal to `h` (with `s[0] != h` condition met) plus elements less than or equal to `h` after the first match, `z` is 1 if any element equal to `h` was found, `n` and `k` are unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `ans` is `len(s) - 1`, `h` is `s[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` remains the same, `j` and `p` are the number of elements processed minus 1, `ans1` is the count of specific elements, `z` is 1 if `h` was encountered, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `ans` remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
