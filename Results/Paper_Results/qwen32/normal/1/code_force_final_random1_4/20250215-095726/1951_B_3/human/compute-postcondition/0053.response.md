Postcondition: **`s` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the next element in `s`. If `i` equals `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i` does not equal `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h` and `i` does not equal `h`, `z` is set to 1. If `z` equals 1 and `i` does not equal `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1.**
