To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans, ans1))` statement, we need to understand the values of `ans` and `ans1` based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- `s` remains the same (but its value is not specified).
- `j` and `p` are the number of elements processed minus 1 (but their exact values are not specified).
- `ans1` is the count of specific elements (but the specific elements and their count are not specified).
- `z` is 1 if `h` was encountered (but the value of `z` is not relevant to the print statement).
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged (but their values are not specified).
- `t` remains unchanged (but its value is not specified).
- `ans` remains the same (but its value is not specified).

### Analysis:
The `print(max(ans, ans1))` statement will print the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1`. Since the exact values of `ans` and `ans1` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1`.

Output: **max(ans, ans1) (where ans and ans1 are the counts or values as described in the initial state)**
