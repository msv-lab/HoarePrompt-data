Output State: **`s` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 · 10^5. The length of the list s (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings in s does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found across all strings in `s`. `i` is 0, `j` is len(unique_chars) - 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variables `i` and `j` have been initialized. `i` is set to 0, and `j` is set to the last index of the `unique_chars` list, which is `len(unique_chars) - 1`. All other conditions regarding the list `s` and the list `unique_chars` remain unchanged.
