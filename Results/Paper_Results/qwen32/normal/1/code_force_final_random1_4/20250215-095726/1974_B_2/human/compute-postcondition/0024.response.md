Postcondition: **`s` is a list of strings with at least one more element to process. If `char` was in `unique_chars`, each occurrence of `char` in `s` has been replaced with `unique_chars[j]` and `j` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found across all strings in `s` with `char` inserted at index `i`, `char` is the next element in `s`, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is increased by 1.**
