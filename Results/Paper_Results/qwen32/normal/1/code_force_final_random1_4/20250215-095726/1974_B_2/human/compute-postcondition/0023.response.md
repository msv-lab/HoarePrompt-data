The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. The other variables (`s`, `unique_chars`, `char`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a list of strings with at least one more element to process, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found across all strings in `s` with `char` inserted at index `i`, `char` is the next element in `s`, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1.**
