Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process:**
   - The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` which contains all distinct characters of the original string `s`, sorted alphabetically.
   - Each character in the original string `s` is replaced by its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - To decode, we need to reverse this process.
   - We need to identify the auxiliary string `r` from the encoded string `b`.
   - Then, for each character in `b`, we replace it with its symmetric counterpart in `r` to get back the original string `s`.

3. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It calls `func_1(b)` to decode the string `b`.
   - Let's examine `func_1(s)` in detail:
     - It creates a set of unique characters from `s` and sorts them to form `unique_chars`.
     - It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` at the start and end of `unique_chars`, respectively.
     - It iterates through each character in `s` and replaces it with the corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars`.
     - However, there are several issues in this approach:
       - The `replace` method is used inside the loop, which replaces all occurrences of the character in the string, not just the current one. This can lead to incorrect results.
       - The `else` block where characters are inserted into `unique_chars` and pointers are adjusted is incorrect because it assumes that characters not in `unique_chars` should be added, which is not the case for decoding.
       - The function returns `''.join(unique_chars)`, which is incorrect because it doesn't reconstruct the original string `s` but rather returns the modified `unique_chars`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the decoding process. It incorrectly modifies the string and does not properly reconstruct the original string `s` from the encoded string `b`.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
