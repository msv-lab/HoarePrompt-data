Output State: **`s` is a list of strings that must contain at least one string, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters found across all strings in `s` with `char` inserted at the beginning, `i` is 1, `j` is len(unique_chars), and `char` is in `unique_chars`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` now equals `len(unique_chars)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
