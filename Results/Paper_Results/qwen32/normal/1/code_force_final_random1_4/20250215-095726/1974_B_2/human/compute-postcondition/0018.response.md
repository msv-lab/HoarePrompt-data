The only variable in the loop head is `char`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `s`. If there are more elements in `s`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `char` was the last processed character from `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another character left in `s` to be processed. Therefore, `char` should be the next element in `s`.

Since `char` is the loop variable and it gets assigned the next value from `s` in each iteration, we don't need to change `unique_chars`, `i`, or `j` in the loop head. We just need to ensure that `s` still has elements left.

State: **`s` is a list of strings with at least one more element to process, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found across all strings in `s`, `char` is the next element in `s`**
