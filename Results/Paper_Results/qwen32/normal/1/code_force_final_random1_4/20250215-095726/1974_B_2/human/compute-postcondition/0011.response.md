The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`, which iterates over the elements of the list `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `char` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a list of strings.
- `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found across all strings in `s`.
- `i` is 0 if `char` was in `unique_chars`; otherwise, `i` is 1.
- `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2` if `char` was in `unique_chars`; otherwise, `j` is `len(unique_chars)`.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `char` should be the next element in `s`.

Let's assume that `s` has at least one more element after the current `char` (which was the last processed character). Therefore, `char` should be updated to the next element in `s`.

State: **`s` is a list of strings, and `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found across all strings in `s`. `i` is 0, and `j` is len(unique_chars) - 2 if the next `char` is in `unique_chars`; otherwise, `i` is 1, and `j` is len(unique_chars). `char` is the next element in `s`.** 

However, since we don't know the exact next element in `s` without more information, we'll just denote it as the next element:

State: **`s` is a list of strings, and `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found across all strings in `s`. `char` is the next element in `s`.**
