To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and its effect on the variables.

Given Initial State:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `c` is an array or list (not explicitly defined in the initial state, but implied by the code).

Code Snippet:
```python
i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
```

Impact of the Code:
- The variable `i` is assigned the value of `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.

Since the initial state does not specify the contents of the list `c`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `i`. However, we can express `i` in terms of the elements of `c` at indices `b` and `a - 1`.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.**

In natural language: The value of `i` is now the difference between the element at index `b` and the element at index `a - 1` in the list `c`. The conditions on `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
