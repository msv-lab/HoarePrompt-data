The given Python code snippet contains a single `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`.

The initial state provides details about several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `i`, `j`) and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of these variables does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Given that the `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'YES'`, the output will always be `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
