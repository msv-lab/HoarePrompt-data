The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. The values of `x`, `i`, and `j` remain as per their initial conditions unless `x` is equal to 1, in which case `j` is incremented by 1. Since the code does not modify `x` or `j` directly, their states remain unchanged except for the potential increment of `j` if `x` equals 1.

Output State: **`x` is `x_next`; `i` is increased by `x_next`; if `x` is equal to 1, `j` is increased by 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `p` has `i` appended to it.**
