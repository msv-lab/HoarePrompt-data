The code snippet appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements
- If `x` equals 1, `c` is updated to `[0, j, j+1]`. Otherwise, `c` remains `[0, j, j]`
- `p` remains `[0, i, i]`
- `x` is the next element in `l` after the current `x`
- `i` is increased by `x`

After executing `p.append(i)`, the list `p` will now include the new value of `i` at the end.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements; If `x` equals 1, `c` is updated to `[0, j, j+1]`. Otherwise, `c` remains `[0, j, j]`; `p` is `[0, i, i, i]`; `x` is the next element in `l` after the current `x`; `i` is increased by `x`.**
