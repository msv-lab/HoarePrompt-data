The code snippet increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` is initially set to 1 if the next element in `l` after `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0. After the increment, `j` will be 2 if it was initially 1, and `j` will be 1 if it was initially 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i]`, `c` is `[0, j]`, `i` is the next element in `l` after `x`, `j` is 2 if the next element in `l` after `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 1**.
