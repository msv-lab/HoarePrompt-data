Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input; `p` is a list containing the single element 0; `c` is a list containing the single element 0; `i` is 0; `j` is 0.**

This means that the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` retain their initial values, while `i` and `j` are both set to 0.
