Output State: **`t` is \(t-1\), `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `l` is a list of integers with at least one element, `p` is `[0, i, i, i]`, `i` is `next_x + x + x`, `j` is `3` if `next_x` is `1` else `j` is `2`, `c` is `[0, j, j]`, `x` is the next element in the list `l`. If `x` is equal to 1, then `j` becomes `3` if `next_x` is `1` else `j` becomes `2`. Otherwise, the values of `j`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged as per the initial conditions.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `p` has been updated to include the value of `i` at the end, making it `[0, i, i, i]`. All other variables retain their initial values unless they were dependent on `p` or `i`, which they are not in this case.
