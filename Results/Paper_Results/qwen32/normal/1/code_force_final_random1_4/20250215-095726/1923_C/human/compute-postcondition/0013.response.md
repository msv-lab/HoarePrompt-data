The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which iterates over the elements of the list `l`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` to reflect the next element in the list `l`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element
- `p` is `[0, i]`
- `c` is `[0, j]`
- `i` is `x`
- `j` is 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the current element being processed from the list `l`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be updated to the next element in the list `l`.

Since we don't know the exact position of `x` in the list `l` from the given state, let's assume that `x` was the `k`-th element in the list `l`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `x` should be the `(k+1)`-th element in the list `l`.

However, since we don't have the specific value of `k`, we can simply denote the next element as the next item in the iteration over `l`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i]`, `c` is `[0, j]`, `i` is the next element in `l` after `x`, `j` is 1 if the next element in `l` after `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0**.

To be more precise, if `x` was the `k`-th element, then the new state would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i]`, `c` is `[0, j]`, `i` is `l[k+1]` if `k+1 < len(l)`, `j` is 1 if `l[k+1]` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0**.

But since we don't have the exact value of `k`, we can just say:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i]`, `c` is `[0, j]`, `i` is the next element in `l` after `x`, `j` is 1 if the next element in `l` after `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0**.
