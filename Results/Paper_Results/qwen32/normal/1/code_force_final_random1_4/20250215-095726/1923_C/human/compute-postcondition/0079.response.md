Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `s` has been updated to be equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. All other variables (`m`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) retain their initial values and conditions.
