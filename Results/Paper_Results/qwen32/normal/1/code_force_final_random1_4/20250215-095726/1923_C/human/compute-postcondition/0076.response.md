In the given for loop:

```python
for _ in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable) and `m`, which determines how many times the loop will iterate.

To ensure the loop executes, the value of `m` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` does not need to be initialized because it is reassigned during each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m`.

State: **`m` must be greater than 0**
