The value of `i` is updated to be the difference between `c[b]` and `c[a - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`; `p` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative sums of elements in `l`; `c` is a list starting with `0` and ending with the cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in `l`; `m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the first input integer; `b` is the second input integer.**
