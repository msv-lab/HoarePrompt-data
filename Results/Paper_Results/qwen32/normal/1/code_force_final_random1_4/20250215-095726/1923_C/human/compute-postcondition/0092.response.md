The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `m`. Since the loop iterates `m` times, at the start of each iteration, `m` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the remaining iterations.

Given that `m` is `m - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `m` should be further decremented by 1. The other variables `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`m` is `m - 2`, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**
