Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `p` is `[0, i]`, `c` is `[0, j]`, `i` is the next element in `l` after `x`. If `x` is 1, then `j` is 2; otherwise, `j` is 1.**
