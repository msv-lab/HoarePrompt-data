Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `m` is set to `m - 1`.
- `a` and `b` are new integers read from the input.
- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward. It simply outputs the string `'YES'`. None of the variables (`m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `s`) are used in this specific `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
