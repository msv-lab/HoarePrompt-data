### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated version to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
A subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` is considered "good" if there exists an integer array `b` of the same length such that:
1. The sum of elements in the subarray equals the sum of elements in `b`.
2. No element in the subarray is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
3. All elements in `b` are greater than 0.

#### Program Breakdown:
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation (`p`)**: This array stores cumulative sums of the elements in the array `c`.
2. **Count of 1s Calculation (`c`)**: This array stores cumulative counts of 1s in the array `c`.
3. **Query Processing**: For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray using the prefix sums and the count of 1s in the subarray. It then checks if the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` meeting the criteria.

#### Query Logic:
For each query defined by `a` and `b`:
- `i = c[b] - c[a - 1]`: This gives the count of 1s in the subarray `c[a:b+1]`.
- `s = p[b] - p[a - 1]`: This gives the sum of the elements in the subarray `c[a:b+1]`.
- The condition `b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is checked:
  - `b - a + 1 > 1`: Ensures the subarray has more than one element.
  - `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`: Ensures that after reducing each element of the subarray by at least 1 (to make `b_i > 0` and `a_i != b_i`), the remaining sum is still non-negative and sufficient to distribute among the elements.

#### Evaluation Using Annotations:
Let's verify the logic with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `1 5 4 1 2 1 4 5 1 5 4 4 3 4 1 3`
  - Output: `YES NO YES NO`

  - **Query 1 (1 5)**: Subarray `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]`
    - Sum `s = 13`
    - Count of 1s `i = 2`
    - Length `b - a + 1 = 5`
    - Check: `5 > 1` and `13 - 5 >= 2` → `8 >= 2` → True → `YES`
  
  - **Query 2 (4 4)**: Subarray `[4]`
    - Sum `s = 4`
    - Count of 1s `i = 0`
    - Length `b - a + 1 = 1`
    - Check: `1 > 1` → False → `NO`
  
  - **Query 3 (3 4)**: Subarray `[1, 4]`
    - Sum `s = 5`
    - Count of 1s `i = 1`
    - Length `b - a + 1 = 2`
    - Check: `2 > 1` and `5 - 2 >= 1` → `3 >= 1` → True → `YES`
  
  - **Query 4 (1 3)**: Subarray `[1, 2, 1]`
    - Sum `s = 4`
    - Count of 1s `i = 2`
    - Length `b - a + 1 = 3`
    - Check: `3 > 1` and `4 - 3 >= 2` → `1 >= 2` → False → `NO`

The program correctly handles these queries.

#### Edge Case Verification:
Consider a subarray with all elements being 1s, e.g., `[1, 1, 1]`:
- Sum `s = 3`
- Count of 1s `i = 3`
- Length `b - a + 1 = 3`
- Check: `3 > 1` and `3 - 3 >= 3` → `0 >= 3` → False → `NO`

This edge case is also correctly handled by the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. It handles both the provided example and edge cases correctly.

**Final: True**
