The code snippet calculates the difference between the cumulative sums at indices `b` and `a-1` in the list `p`. This difference represents the sum of the elements in the sublist of `l` from index `a-1` to `b-1`.

Given the initial state, the value of `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is `[0]` followed by the cumulative sums of elements in `l`, `c` is `[0]` followed by the cumulative counts of `1`s in `l`, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.**
