The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the input, while the values of `m`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is `m - 2`, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers provided by the input. The values of `m`, `i`, and `s` remain the same as they were before the input operation.
