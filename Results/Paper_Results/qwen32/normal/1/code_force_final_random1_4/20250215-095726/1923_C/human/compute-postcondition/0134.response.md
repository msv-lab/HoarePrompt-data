Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`. This represents the count of `1`s in the sublist of `l` from index `a-1` to `b`.
   - `j` is the total count of `1`s in the entire list `l`.
   - `p` is a list starting with `0` and ending with cumulative sums of elements in `l`. For example, if `l = [1, 2, 3]`, then `p = [0, 1, 3, 6]`.
   - `c` is a list starting with `0` and ending with cumulative counts of `1`s encountered in `l`. For example, if `l = [0, 1, 0, 1]`, then `c = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]`.
   - `m` is an integer greater than 0, but its specific value is not needed for this analysis.
   - `a` and `b` are input integers representing indices in the list `l`.
   - `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. This represents the sum of elements in the sublist of `l` from index `a-1` to `b`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - Either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

### Print Statement Analysis:

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables `i`, `j`, `p`, `c`, `m`, `a`, `b`, or `s`. It directly prints the string `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:

Since the print statement is independent of the values of the variables and only outputs the string `'NO'`, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
