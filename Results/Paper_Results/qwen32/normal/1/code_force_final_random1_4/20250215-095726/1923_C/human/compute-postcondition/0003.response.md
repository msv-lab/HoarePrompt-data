Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input; `p` is a list containing the single element 0.**

Explanation: The value of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `l` remain unchanged. A new list `p` is created and initialized with a single element, which is 0.
