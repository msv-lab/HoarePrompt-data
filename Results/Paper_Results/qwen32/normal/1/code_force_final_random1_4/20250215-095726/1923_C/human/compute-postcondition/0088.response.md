The given code snippet reassigns the variable `s` to the value of `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. However, the initial state already defines `s` as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, meaning the value of `s` does not change after executing the code snippet.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`m` is `m - 1`, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**
