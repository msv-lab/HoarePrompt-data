The given code snippet reassigns the value of `i` to `c[b] - c[a - 1]`. However, since `i` was already initialized with the same expression (`i = c[b] - c[a - 1]`) in the initial state, the value of `i` does not change after executing the code snippet.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to the variables `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s`.

Output State: **`m` is `m - 1`, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**.
