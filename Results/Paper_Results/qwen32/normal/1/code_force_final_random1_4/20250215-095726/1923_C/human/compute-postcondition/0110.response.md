Output State: **`x` is an integer; `i` is increased by `x`; if `x` is equal to 1, `j` is increased by 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `i` is increased by the value of `x`. The condition for `j` remains the same: if `x` was equal to 1, `j` would have been increased by 1; otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.
