The given Python code snippet contains only a single `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'YES'` to the console. The initial state provides several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `i`, `j`) and their relationships, but these do not affect the execution of this particular `print` statement. The string `'YES'` is hardcoded and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
