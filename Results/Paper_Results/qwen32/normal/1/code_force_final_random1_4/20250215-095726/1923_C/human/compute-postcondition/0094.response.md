The given code snippet reassigns the value of `i` using the same expression that was used to define it initially. Since the expression `c[b] - c[a - 1]` is used again to assign to `i`, the value of `i` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`m` is `m - 2`, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.**

This means that `m` retains its value as `m - 2`, `a` and `b` keep their values as the integers read from the input, `i` remains `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, and `s` stays `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
