In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on adjusting the state related to `t`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will execute `int(input())` times.
2. **Dependency on Input**: The number of iterations (`t`) is determined by the integer input. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.
3. **Adjustments Needed**: Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it inherently satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. However, we need to ensure that the input reflects this.

Given these points, the state should reflect that `t` is an integer that ensures the loop will execute at least once. Since `t` is already constrained to be within the valid range, no further adjustments are needed for `t` itself. However, we need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` matches this constraint.

Thus, the state should be adjusted to reflect that the input to `int(input())` is an integer `t` that is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
Since the loop directly depends on the input being read, we ensure that the input provided to the program is an integer within the specified range.

Final State: **The input to `int(input())` must be an integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

However, since the problem specifies the initial state of `t` already, we can simply restate it in the required format:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
