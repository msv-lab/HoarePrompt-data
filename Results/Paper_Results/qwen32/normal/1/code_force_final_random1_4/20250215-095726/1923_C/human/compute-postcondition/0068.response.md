The code snippet appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Given the initial state, `c` is initially `[0, j]`. After appending `j` to `c`, `c` becomes `[0, j, j]`.

Output State: **`t` is \(t-1\), `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `l` is a list of integers with at least one element, `p` is `[0, i, i]`, `i` is `next_x + x`, `j` is `2` if `next_x` is `1` else `j` is `1`, and `c` is `[0, j, j]`.**
