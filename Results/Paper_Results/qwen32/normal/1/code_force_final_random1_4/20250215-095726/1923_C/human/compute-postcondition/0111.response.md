The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. The values of `x` and `j` remain unchanged unless they were modified before this code snippet, which they are not in the given snippet. The value of `i` is increased by `x` before this line, so `i` now holds its new value.

Output State: **`x` is an integer; `i` is increased by `x`; if `x` is equal to 1, `j` is increased by 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `p` has `i` appended to it.**
