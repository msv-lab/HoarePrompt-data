To determine the output of the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (This seems to be related to the number of test cases but is not directly relevant to the current print statement).
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `d1` is a `defaultdict` with integer keys from 2 to `n` and values computed based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`.
- `d2` is a `defaultdict` with integer keys from 1 to `n-1` and values computed based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` as per the loop logic.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is equal to `m-1`.
- `x` and `y` are new pairs of integers obtained from the input, with `y` being less than or equal to `x`.

### Understanding `d2`:
The `d2` dictionary is constructed with keys from 1 to `n-1`. Each key `k` in `d2` holds the cumulative sum of differences between consecutive elements in `l` starting from the first element up to the `k`-th element. Specifically, if `l = [l1, l2, ..., ln]`, then:
- `d2[1] = 0` (by default, since there are no previous elements to subtract from the first one)
- `d2[2] = l2 - l1`
- `d2[3] = (l2 - l1) + (l3 - l2) = l3 - l1`
- ...
- `d2[k] = (l2 - l1) + (l3 - l2) + ... + (lk - lk-1) = lk - l1`

### Evaluating `d2[y] - d2[x]`:
Given that `y` is less than or equal to `x`, we need to evaluate the expression `d2[y] - d2[x]`.

- `d2[y]` represents the cumulative difference from `l1` to `ly`.
- `d2[x]` represents the cumulative difference from `l1` to `lx`.

Therefore, `d2[y] - d2[x]` can be interpreted as:
\[ d2[y] - d2[x] = (ly - l1) - (lx - l1) = ly - lx \]

### Conclusion:
The `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement will print the difference between the `y`-th and `x`-th elements of the list `l`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ly - lx (where ly is the y-th element of the list l and lx is the x-th element of the list l)**
