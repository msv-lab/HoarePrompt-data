You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, their positions `l`, the number of queries `m`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Dictionaries `d1` and `d2`:**
   - Two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, are used to store the minimum cost to reach the end from a given city moving forward (`d1`) and backward (`d2`).
   - `d1` is initialized with `d1[2] = 1` which seems incorrect as it should start from the first city.
   - `d2` is initialized with `d2[n - 1] = 1` which is correct as it starts from the last city.

3. **Filling `d1`:**
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n - 1):` calculates the minimum cost to reach the end from each city moving forward.
   - It checks whether the next city is closer than the previous one and updates the cost accordingly.
   - However, the logic seems flawed because it does not correctly handle the initial conditions and might not account for the unique closest city condition properly.

4. **Filling `d2`:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):` calculates the minimum cost to reach the beginning from each city moving backward.
   - Similar to `d1`, it checks whether the previous city is closer than the next one and updates the cost accordingly.
   - Again, the logic might not handle the unique closest city condition properly.

5. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query `(x, y)`, it calculates the cost using either `d1` or `d2` depending on whether `y` is greater than `x`.
   - The calculation `d1[y] - d1[x]` or `d2[y] - d2[x]` is used to find the cost.

### Issues Identified

- **Initialization of `d1`:** The initialization `d1[2] = 1` is incorrect. It should start from the first city, and the entire logic for filling `d1` needs to be re-evaluated.
- **Logic for Filling `d1` and `d2`:** The logic for determining the closest city and updating the cost might not be correct. It does not seem to account for the unique closest city condition properly.
- **Cost Calculation:** The cost calculation using `d1` and `d2` might not yield the correct results due to the above issues.

### Conclusion

Given the identified issues, the program does not seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
