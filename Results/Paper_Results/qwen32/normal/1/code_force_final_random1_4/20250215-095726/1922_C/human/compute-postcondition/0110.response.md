Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and contains keys from 2 to n with values computed based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and contains keys from 1 to n-1 with values computed based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` as per the loop logic, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m-1`, and `x` and `y` are the new pair of integers obtained from the input. Additionally, if `y` is greater than `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.**
