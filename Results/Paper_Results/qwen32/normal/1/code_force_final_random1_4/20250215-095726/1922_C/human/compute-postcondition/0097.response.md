To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the relevant computations:

1. **Variables and Lists**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is initialized to 1.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 2.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `d1` is a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory, containing keys from 2 to `n` with values computed based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`.
   - `d2` is a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory, containing keys from 1 to `n-1` with values computed based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` as per the loop logic.
   - `m` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `j` is set to `m-1`.
   - `x` and `y` are new pairs of integers obtained from the input, with `y > x`.

2. **Computations**:
   - The `d1` dictionary is populated with keys from 2 to `n`. For each key `k` in this range, `d1[k]` is the difference between the `k-th` and `(k-1)-th` elements in the list `l`. That is, `d1[k] = l[k-1] - l[k-2]`.
   - The `d2` dictionary is populated with keys from 1 to `n-1`. For each key `k` in this range, `d2[k]` is the difference between the `k-th` and `(k+1)-th` elements in the list `l`. That is, `d2[k] = l[k-1] - l[k]`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` computes the difference between the values of `d1` at keys `y` and `x`.
   - Given that `d1[k] = l[k-1] - l[k-2]`, the expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` translates to:
     \[
     (l[y-1] - l[y-2]) - (l[x-1] - l[x-2])
     \]

4. **Final Output**:
   - The print statement will output the result of the above expression, which is the difference between the difference of consecutive elements at positions `y-1` and `y-2` in the list `l`, and the difference of consecutive elements at positions `x-1` and `x-2` in the list `l`.

Given the information, the output can be described precisely as follows:

Output: **(l[y-1] - l[y-2]) - (l[x-1] - l[x-2])**
