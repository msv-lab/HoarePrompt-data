Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 4`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory where `d2[n - 1]` is 1. If `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**
