To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the provided initial state and the relevant parts of the code snippet:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is an integer greater than 2.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `d1` is a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory.
- `d2` is a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory, and `d2[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is updated based on the loop's logic.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `x` and `y` are two integers obtained from new input.
- `j` is initialized to 2.

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in question is:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

#### Understanding `d1`:
- `d1` is a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory, meaning any key that does not exist in `d1` will return 0 by default.
- The specific values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` depend on how `d1` is populated in the code, which is not explicitly shown here. However, we know that if `x` or `y` have not been assigned any specific values in `d1`, they will default to 0.

#### Values of `x` and `y`:
- `x` and `y` are integers obtained from new input. Their exact values are not specified, but they are used as keys to access values in `d1`.

### Output Determination:
Given that `d1` is a `defaultdict(int)`, if `x` and `y` do not have any specific values assigned in `d1`, both `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` will be 0. Therefore, the expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` would evaluate to `0 - 0 = 0`.

However, if `x` and `y` do have specific values assigned in `d1`, the output would be the difference between these specific values.

Since the exact values of `x`, `y`, and the contents of `d1` are not provided, the most precise description we can give is based on the default behavior of `defaultdict(int)`.

### Final Output:
Output: **0 (assuming x and y do not have specific values assigned in d1)**
