The code snippet creates a new defaultdict named `d2` with `int` as the default factory. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, or `d1`. The only change is the introduction of `d2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory.**
