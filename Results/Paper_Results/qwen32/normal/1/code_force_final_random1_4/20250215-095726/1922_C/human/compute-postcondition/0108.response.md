To determine the output of the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `i` is initialized to 1.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `d1` is a `defaultdict` with integer keys from 2 to `n` and values computed based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`.
   - `d2` is a `defaultdict` with integer keys from 1 to `n-1` and values computed based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l` as per the loop logic.
   - `m` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is set to `m-1`.
   - `x` and `y` are new pairs of integers obtained from the input.
   - If `y > x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Understanding `d1`:**
   - `d1` is a dictionary where the key `k` (for `k` ranging from 2 to `n`) holds the difference between the `k`-th and `(k-1)`-th elements of the list `l`. That is, `d1[k] = l[k-1] - l[k-2]`.

3. **The Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` computes the difference between the values stored in `d1` for keys `y` and `x`.
   - Given the definition of `d1`, `d1[y]` is the difference between the `y`-th and `(y-1)`-th elements of `l`, i.e., `l[y-1] - l[y-2]`.
   - Similarly, `d1[x]` is the difference between the `x`-th and `(x-1)`-th elements of `l`, i.e., `l[x-1] - l[x-2]`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` evaluates to `(l[y-1] - l[y-2]) - (l[x-1] - l[x-2])`.
   - This simplifies to `l[y-1] - l[y-2] - l[x-1] + l[x-2]`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement will be the result of the expression `l[y-1] - l[y-2] - l[x-1] + l[x-2]`.

Output: **l[y-1] - l[y-2] - l[x-1] + l[x-2]**
