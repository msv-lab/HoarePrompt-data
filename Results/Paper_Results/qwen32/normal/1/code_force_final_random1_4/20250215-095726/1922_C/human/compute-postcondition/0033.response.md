The given code snippet updates the value of `d2[i]` to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. This means the value of `d2[i]` is now explicitly set to one plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` remains `n - 4`.
- `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `l` remains a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `d1` remains a defaultdict with int as the default factory.
- `d2` is updated such that `d2[i]` is now `1 + d2[i + 1]`. All other entries in `d2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 4`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory where `d2[n - 1]` is 1, and `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`.**
