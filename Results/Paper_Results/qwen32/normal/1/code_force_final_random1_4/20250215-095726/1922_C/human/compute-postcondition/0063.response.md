Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and contains {2: 1}, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory (and is now empty), `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m-1`, and `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input. Additionally, the difference between the (i+1)-th and i-th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the i-th and (i-1)-th elements of `l`.**
