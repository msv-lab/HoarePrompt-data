To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])`, let's break down the initial state and how the variables are defined:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `d1` is a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. The value of `d1[k]` for `k` from 3 to `n` is computed based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`.
   - `d2` is a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. The value of `d2[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is computed based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` as described in the loop.
   - `m` is an integer obtained from the input and must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is set to `m`.
   - `x` and `y` are a pair of integers obtained from the input. If `y` is greater than `x`, then `y > x`; otherwise, `y <= x`.

2. **Understanding `d2`**:
   - `d2` is populated with keys from 1 to `n-1`, and each key `i` holds the cumulative sum of differences between consecutive elements of `l` up to the `i-th` position. Specifically, `d2[i]` would be the sum of differences `l[j+1] - l[j]` for `j` from 0 to `i-1`.

3. **Expression to be Printed**:
   - The expression `d2[y] - d2[x]` computes the difference between the cumulative sums of differences up to positions `y` and `x` in the list `l`.
   - This effectively calculates the sum of differences `l[j+1] - l[j]` for `j` from `x` to `y-1`.

Given the above understanding, the output of the `print` statement will be the sum of differences between consecutive elements of `l` starting from the `x-th` position up to the `(y-1)-th` position.

Therefore, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **the sum of differences between consecutive elements of `l` from position `x` to `y-1`**.
