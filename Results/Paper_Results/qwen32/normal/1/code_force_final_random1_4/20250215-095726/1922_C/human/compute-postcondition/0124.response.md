To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 3
- `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory
- `d2` is a new defaultdict with int as the default factory
- `m` is greater than 0
- `j` is equal to `m`
- `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input, and if `y` is greater than `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`
- If the difference between the (i+1)-th and i-th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the i-th and (i-1)-th elements of `l`, then `d1[3]` is 0 and `d1[4]` is 1. Otherwise, `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2]`.

Since the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-2`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `i` should be 3 (since it was 2 at the end of the previous iteration)
- `n` remains greater than 3

All other variables (`t`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, `j`, `x`, `y`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a new defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input, and if `y` is greater than `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`. If the difference between the (i+1)-th and i-th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the i-th and (i-1)-th elements of `l`, then `d1[3]` is 0 and `d1[4]` is 1. Otherwise, `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2]`.**
