To determine the output of the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand how `d2` is constructed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **List `l`:** This is a list of integers. The exact values are not specified, but it is used to compute the values in `d2`.

2. **Defaultdict `d2`:** This dictionary is initialized with keys from 1 to `n-1` and values computed based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`. Specifically, for each key `k` in `d2`, the value `d2[k]` is the sum of differences between consecutive elements in `l` up to the `k`-th position.

   Mathematically, if `l = [l1, l2, ..., ln]`, then:
   \[
   d2[k] = (l2 - l1) + (l3 - l2) + ... + (lk - lk-1) = lk - l1
   \]
   So, `d2[k]` is essentially `lk - l1` for each `k` from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Variables `x` and `y`:** These are integers obtained from the input. It is given that if `y > x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

### Calculation of `d2[y] - d2[x]`:

Given the definition of `d2[k]`:
- `d2[y] = ly - l1`
- `d2[x] = lx - l1`

Thus, the expression `d2[y] - d2[x]` simplifies to:
\[
d2[y] - d2[x] = (ly - l1) - (lx - l1) = ly - lx
\]

### Final Output:

The `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement will print the difference between the `y`-th and `x`-th elements of the list `l`.

Output: **ly - lx (where ly is the y-th element of the list `l` and lx is the x-th element of the list `l`)**
