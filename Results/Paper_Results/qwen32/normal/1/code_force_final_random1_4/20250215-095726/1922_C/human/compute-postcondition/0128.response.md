The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4. The variable `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains greater than 3.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a new defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input, and if `y` is greater than `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`. If the difference between the (i+1)-th and i-th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the i-th and (i-1)-th elements of `l`, then `d1[3]` is 0, `d1[4]` is 1, and `d1[5]` is `1 + d1[4]`. Otherwise, `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2]` and `d1[5]` is `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`.**
