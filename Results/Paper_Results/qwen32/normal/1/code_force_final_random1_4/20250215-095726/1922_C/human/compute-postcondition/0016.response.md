To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The current state at the end of the previous iteration is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, and `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory. 
- The condition inside the loop affects `d1` but does not influence the loop's control variables (`i` and `n`).

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means the loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n - 1`.

Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration to proceed with the loop.

Thus, the new value of `i` should be 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper bound of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, and `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory.**
