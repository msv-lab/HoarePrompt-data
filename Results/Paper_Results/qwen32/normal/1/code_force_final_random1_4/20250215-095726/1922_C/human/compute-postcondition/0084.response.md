To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and the loop's range.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is `n-2`.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and contains keys from 2 to n with values computed based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`.
- `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and contains the key `n-1` with the value 1. If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2` also contains the key `i` with the value 2. Otherwise, `d2` contains the key `i` with the value `l[i] - l[i - 1] + 1` and the difference between the `i+1`th and `i`th elements of `l` is less than or equal to the difference between the `i`th and `i-1`th elements of `l`.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is equal to `m-1`.
- `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input.

Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` decreased by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `t` remains the same.
- `i` is now `n-3` (since it was `n-2` at the end of the previous iteration).
- `n` remains the same.
- `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, `j`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n-3`, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and contains keys from 2 to n with values computed based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and contains the key `n-1` with the value 1. If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2` also contains the key `i` with the value 2. Otherwise, `d2` contains the key `i` with the value `l[i] - l[i - 1] + 1` and the difference between the `i+1`th and `i`th elements of `l` is less than or equal to the difference between the `i`th and `i-1`th elements of `l`. `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m-1`, and `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input.**
