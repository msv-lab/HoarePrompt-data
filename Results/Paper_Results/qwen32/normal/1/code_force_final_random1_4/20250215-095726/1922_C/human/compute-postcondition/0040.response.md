Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory where `d2[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is updated based on the loop's logic, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` and `y` are the two integers obtained from the input, and `y` is greater than `x`.**
