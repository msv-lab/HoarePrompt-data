To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and implicitly `l` since it's used within the loop condition and body.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer greater than 2
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory
- `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory
- The value of `d1[3]` is determined based on the condition `if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`.

Since the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-2` (inclusive), at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The other variables (`n` and `l`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory**.
