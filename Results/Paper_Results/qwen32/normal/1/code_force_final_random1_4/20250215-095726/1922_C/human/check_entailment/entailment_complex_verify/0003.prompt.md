You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities on the number line in ascending order, where 2 <= n <= 10^5 and 0 <= cities[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. Additionally, for each city, there is a uniquely determined closest city. The function `func_1` should also accept an integer n, which represents the number of cities, but this information is redundant since the length of the cities list already provides n.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)

        back = -99999999

    #State: `prog_cities` is a list where each element `prog_cities[i]` is `1` if the next city is closer than the previous city, otherwise it is the distance to the next city.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns the list `prog_cities` where each element is `1` if the next city is closer than the previous city, otherwise it is the distance to the next city.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `cities` representing the coordinates of cities on a number line in ascending order and returns a list `prog_cities`. Each element in `prog_cities` is `1` if the next city is closer than the previous city; otherwise, it is the distance to the next city.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, their coordinates, the number of queries `m`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Determining Closest Cities:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city.
   - However, there is an issue with the implementation of `func_1`. It calculates the cost to move to the closest city but does not correctly identify the closest city itself. Instead, it should return an array where each element indicates whether the closest city is the next city (1) or the previous city (the distance to the previous city).
   - The function incorrectly sets `prog_cities[i]` to `abs(forward - cities[i])` when the closest city is the next city. It should set it to 1 in this case.

3. **Calculating Prefix Sums:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the costs to move to the closest city in both forward and backward directions.
   - These prefix sums are used to quickly compute the cost of moving from one city to another using the closest city strategy.

4. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, the program determines the direction of travel (forward or backward) and uses the appropriate prefix sum array to compute the cost.
   - The logic for determining the direction and computing the cost seems correct.

### Issues Identified:

- The primary issue lies in the `func_1` function. It does not correctly identify the closest city. Instead of setting `prog_cities[i]` to 1 when the closest city is the next city, it sets it to the distance to the next city. This results in incorrect prefix sums and, consequently, incorrect answers for the queries.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program is not correct.

**Correctness:** **False**
