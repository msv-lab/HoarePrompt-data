The given code snippet only reinitializes `d1` to a new `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. This means that `d1` loses its previous contents and becomes an empty dictionary with the same default behavior.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the integer obtained from the input, `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory (and is now empty), `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory where `d2[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is updated based on the loop's logic, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m-1`, and `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input.**
