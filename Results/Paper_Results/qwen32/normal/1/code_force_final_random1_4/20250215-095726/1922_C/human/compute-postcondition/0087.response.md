Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n-3`, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and contains keys from 2 to n with values computed based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and contains the key `n-1` with the value 1. If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is set to 2. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is set to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + 1`. Additionally, `d2[i]` is updated to `1 + d2[i + 1]` if `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, otherwise it is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m-1`, and `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input.**
