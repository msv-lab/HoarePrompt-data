Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, i is equal to t (indicating all test cases have been processed), n is undefined (as it changes with each iteration), l is undefined (as it changes with each iteration), d1 is undefined (as it changes with each iteration), d2 is undefined (as it changes with each iteration), m is undefined (as it changes with each iteration), and j is undefined (as it changes with each iteration).**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `t`, indicating that all `t` test cases have been processed. The variables `n`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, and `j` do not retain specific values because they change with each iteration of the outer loop. After processing each test case, these variables are redefined based on the new inputs for that test case. Therefore, at the end of all iterations, these variables do not hold any specific meaningful value from the final test case, as they are not preserved across different test cases.
