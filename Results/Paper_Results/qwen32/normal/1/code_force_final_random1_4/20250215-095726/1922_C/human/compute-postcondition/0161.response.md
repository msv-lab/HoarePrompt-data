Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory where `d1[k]` for `k` from 3 to `n` is computed based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory where `d2[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is computed based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` as described in the loop, `m` is a new integer obtained from the input and must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are the new pair of integers obtained from the input. If `y` is greater than `x`, then `y` is indeed greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.**
