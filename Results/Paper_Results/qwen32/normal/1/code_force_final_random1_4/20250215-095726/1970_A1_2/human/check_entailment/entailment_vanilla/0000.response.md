To determine if the given program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement, let's break down the code and verify its logic step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Data Structure `BalanceInfo`:**
   - The code uses a data structure `BalanceInfo` which is not explicitly defined in the provided snippet. We can infer that this class stores three attributes: `balance`, `position`, and `character`. 
   - Given the context, `BalanceInfo` should be defined something like:
     ```python
     class BalanceInfo:
         def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
             self.balance = balance
             self.position = position
             self.character = character
     ```

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function compares two `BalanceInfo` objects (`infoA` and `infoB`) based on their `balance` attribute.
   - If the balances are different, it returns the difference between the balances.
   - If the balances are the same, it returns the negative difference of their positions, ensuring that ties in balance are broken by decreasing order of position.
   - This function is used as a custom sorting key in `func_2`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function takes a string `s` representing a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It iterates through the string `s`, maintaining a running `balance` counter that increases with each `'('` and decreases with each `')'`.
   - For each character in the string, it creates a `BalanceInfo` object with the current balance, position, and character, and appends it to `balance_info`.
   - After constructing the `balance_info` list, it sorts the list using a lambda function as the key. The lambda function sorts primarily by `balance` in ascending order and secondarily by `position` in descending order (achieved by negating the position).
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the `character` attributes of the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects and prints it.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

- **Sorting Logic:** The sorting criteria match the problem statement's requirement to sort by prefix balance in increasing order and break ties by position in decreasing order.
- **Result Construction:** The final result is constructed by concatenating the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects, which aligns with the definition of the balanced shuffle operation.
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles the constraints provided in the problem statement, including sequences up to 500,000 characters long and ensuring the input is a balanced parentheses sequence.

### Conclusion:

Given that the code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as per the problem statement, we can conclude that the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
