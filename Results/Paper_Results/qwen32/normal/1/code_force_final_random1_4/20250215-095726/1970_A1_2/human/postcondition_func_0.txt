The function `func_1` takes two objects, `infoA` and `infoB`, each having attributes `balance` and `position`. It returns the difference between `infoA.balance` and `infoB.balance` if they are not equal. If `infoA.balance` equals `infoB.balance`, it returns the difference between `infoB.position` and `infoA.position`, which results in 0.
