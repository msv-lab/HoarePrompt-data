You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position

#Function 2:
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes a string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and prints a new string formed by sorting the characters based on their balance and position values. The final output is a rearranged version of the input string, not the maximum depth of nested parentheses.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and the solution step-by-step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Balanced Parentheses Sequence**: A sequence where the number of opening and closing parentheses are equal, and at no point in the sequence does the number of closing parentheses exceed the number of opening ones.
2. **Balanced Shuffle Operation**: 
   - Compute the balance of each prefix of the sequence.
   - Sort these balances in ascending order, breaking ties by position in descending order.
   - Form a new sequence from the sorted characters.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
- `func_1`: This function seems to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position, but it's not used in the main function `func_2`.
- `func_2`: This function performs the balanced shuffle operation as described.

#### Step-by-Step Explanation of `func_2`:
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store information about each character's balance and position, and a variable `balance` to keep track of the current balance.
2. **Building Balance Information**:
   - It iterates over each character in the input string `s`.
   - For each character, it appends a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info` containing the current balance, the position of the character, and the character itself.
   - It updates the balance: increments it for '(', and decrements it for ')'.
3. **Sorting**:
   - It sorts the `balance_info` list using a lambda function as the key. The lambda function sorts primarily by balance in ascending order and secondarily by position in descending order (achieved by negating the position).
4. **Forming the Result**:
   - It constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list.
   - Finally, it prints the result.

### Verification:
- The sorting criteria ensure that the sequence formed is indeed a balanced shuffle according to the problem statement.
- The logic correctly handles the constraints and examples provided.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
