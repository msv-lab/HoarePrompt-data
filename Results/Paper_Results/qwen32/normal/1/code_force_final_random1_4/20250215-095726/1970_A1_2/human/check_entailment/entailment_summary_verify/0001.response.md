Let's carefully analyze the given program and verify its correctness based on the problem description and the provided function summaries.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to perform a "balanced shuffle" operation on a balanced parentheses sequence.
- The operation involves computing the balance of each prefix, sorting the characters based on these balances (with ties broken by position in reverse order), and forming a new sequence from the sorted characters.

### Code Analysis:
#### Function `func_1`:
This function is intended to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position. However, it is not used within `func_2`. Given the context, it appears to be a utility function that could be used for sorting, but it is redundant since the sorting is already handled in `func_2`.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function performs the core logic of the balanced shuffle operation:
1. **Initialization**: Initializes `balance_info` to store balance, position, and character information, and `balance` to track the current balance.
2. **Building Balance Information**:
   - Iterates through the input string `s`.
   - Appends a `BalanceInfo` object for each character, updating the balance accordingly.
3. **Sorting**:
   - Sorts `balance_info` using a lambda function that sorts by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order (achieved by negating the position).
4. **Forming the Result**:
   - Joins the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list to form the result string.
   - Prints the result.

### Function Summary:
The function summary for `func_2` accurately describes its behavior: it takes a balanced parentheses sequence and prints a new string formed by sorting the characters based on their balance and position values.

### Verification:
- **Sorting Criteria**: The sorting criteria (balance ascending, position descending) ensure that the resulting sequence maintains the properties required by the balanced shuffle operation.
- **Handling of Input Constraints**: The code correctly handles the constraints of the problem, including the requirement that the input is a balanced parentheses sequence.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The sorting logic ensures that the output sequence is balanced and meets the specified criteria.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
