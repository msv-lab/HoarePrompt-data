The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to reflect the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `balance_info` is a list containing two elements `BalanceInfo(0, 0, s[0])` and `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])` where `balance` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '(', and decremented by 1 if `s[i]` is ')'; `i` is `i + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented again, and it should still be less than `n`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `n` remains unchanged as it represents the total length of the string `s`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `balance_info` is a list containing two elements `BalanceInfo(0, 0, s[0])` and `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])` where `balance` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '(', and decremented by 1 if `s[i]` is ')'; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we need to adjust only `i` and `n` based on the loop head, and `n` does not change, we adjust `i`:

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`**.

To be more precise, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `i` is 4** (assuming `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration).

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we generalize it as:

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Thus, the final adjusted state is:

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`**.
