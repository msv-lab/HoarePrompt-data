You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position

#Function 2:
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes a string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and prints a new string formed by sorting the characters based on their balance and position values. The final output is a rearranged version of the input string, not the maximum depth of nested parentheses.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it step-by-step against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to implement a function to perform a "balanced shuffle" on a balanced parentheses sequence.
- The balanced shuffle involves creating a table of prefix balances and positions, sorting this table based on specific criteria, and forming a new sequence from the sorted characters.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function seems to be intended for comparing two `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It compares based on balance first and position second (in reverse order).
   - However, this function is not used in the provided code (`func_2`), so it might be redundant or incorrectly named.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function performs the main logic:
     - It calculates the prefix balance for each character in the input string.
     - It creates a list of `BalanceInfo` objects containing the balance, position, and character.
     - It sorts these objects based on the balance (ascending) and position (descending).
     - It constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted list.

### Potential Issues:
- **Missing Class Definition**: The code references a `BalanceInfo` class which is not defined in the provided snippet. This class is crucial for storing the balance, position, and character information.
- **Sorting Logic**: The sorting logic seems correct based on the problem description.
- **Edge Cases**: We need to ensure that the code handles edge cases like sequences with minimal length or sequences with alternating parentheses.

### Testing the Code:
Let's consider a few test cases to verify the correctness:

1. **Test Case 1**: Input `"(()(()))"`
   - Expected Output: `"()(()())"`
   - The code should produce this output based on the sorting logic described.

2. **Test Case 2**: Input `"((()))"`
   - Expected Output: `"((()))"`
   - Since all opening parentheses come before closing ones, the output should remain the same.

3. **Test Case 3**: Input `"()()"`
   - Expected Output: `"()()"`
   - Since the sequence is already balanced and sorted, the output should remain the same.

4. **Test Case 4**: Input `"(()())"`
   - Expected Output: `"()()()"`
   - This is a more complex case, but the sorting logic should handle it correctly.

### Conclusion:
The code appears to follow the problem description correctly, assuming the `BalanceInfo` class is properly defined. However, since the class definition is missing, we cannot fully verify the correctness without it.

Given the provided code and the problem description, if we assume the `BalanceInfo` class is correctly implemented, the logic seems sound.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement, assuming the `BalanceInfo` class is properly defined and handles the required attributes. The sorting logic adheres to the specified criteria, and the test cases seem to validate the approach.
