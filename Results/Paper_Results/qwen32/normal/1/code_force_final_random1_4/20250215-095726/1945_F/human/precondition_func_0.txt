t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; the second line contains a list v of n integers where 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9; the third line contains a permutation p of n distinct integers from 1 to n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
