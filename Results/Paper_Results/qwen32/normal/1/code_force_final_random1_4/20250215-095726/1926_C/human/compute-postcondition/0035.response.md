The code snippet provided assigns a new value to the variable `n` by reading an integer input from the user. This does not affect the values of `t`, `N`, `pd`, or `i`. 

Given the initial state, `t` remains an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive minus 1, `N` remains 200001, `pd` remains a list where `pd[i]` for `i` from 1 to 200000 contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`, and `i` remains 200001. The only change is that `n` is reassigned to the value of the new integer input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive minus 1, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` for `i` from 1 to 200000 contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`, `i` is 200001, `n` is an input integer.**
