The code snippet `pd[i] += int(j)` modifies the value of `pd[i]` by adding the integer value of `j` to it. Given the initial state, `j` is the next character in the string representation of `i`, and `pd[i]` was initially set to `pd[t] + pd[t - 1] + int(j)`. After executing the code, `pd[i]` will be further incremented by `int(j)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `N` is 200001, `i` is `t`, `pd[t]` is `pd[t] + pd[t - 1] + int(j) + int(j)`**
This means that `pd[t]` has been updated to include an additional `int(j)` from the code execution. All other variables retain their original values or conditions.
