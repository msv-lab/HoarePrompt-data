The given code snippet modifies the value of `pd[i]` by adding `int(j)` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is 4, and `pd[4]` was initially `7 + int(j)`. After executing the code, `pd[4]` will be updated to its current value plus `int(j)`.

Let's break it down:

- Initially, `pd[4]` is `7 + int(j)`.
- After the code executes, `pd[4]` becomes `(7 + int(j)) + int(j)`, which simplifies to `7 + 2 * int(j)`.

Since no other variables are modified, the output state will reflect this change for `pd[4]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[i]` which is the sum of the digits of `i` for each `i` from 1 to `t` with `pd[4]` being `7 + 2 * int(j)`, `i` is 4**.
