You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])

def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num / 10)
    return a



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`, which is expected to be a list of integers, but due to a logical error, it treats `num` as a single integer. It attempts to compute the sum of the digits of this integer. However, the function contains a bug and always returns 0 regardless of the input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Precomputation of Sums:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` set to 0.
   - It then iterates over all integers from 1 to 200,000 (inclusive).
   - For each integer `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits using the function `func_1`.
   - This digit sum is added to the cumulative `sum`.
   - The cumulative `sum` is then appended to the list `A`.

2. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It then prints the value at index `n-1` of the precomputed list `A`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes an integer `num` and returns the sum of its digits.
   - It does so by repeatedly taking the last digit (`num % 10`), adding it to a running total `a`, and removing the last digit (`num = int(num / 10)`) until `num` becomes 0.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Indexing Error:**
   - The program attempts to access `A[n-1]` for each test case `n`.
   - However, the list `A` is precomputed up to the cumulative sum of digit sums for numbers from 1 to 200,000.
   - The issue arises when `n` is greater than the length of `A` (which is 200,000). For such values of `n`, the program will attempt to access an index outside the bounds of `A`, leading to an error.

2. **Efficiency Concerns:**
   - Precomputing the cumulative sum for all numbers up to 200,000 is unnecessary and inefficient for the given constraints.
   - The program should compute the required cumulative sum directly for each test case `n` instead of precomputing it for all possible values up to 200,000.

### Conclusion:

Given the identified issues, particularly the potential out-of-bounds error and inefficiency, the program is not correct according to the problem description.

**Correctness:** **False**
