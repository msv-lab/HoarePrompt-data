The given code snippet contains a syntax error because `num` is a list of integers, and the modulo operation `%` cannot be directly applied to a list. However, assuming the intention was to apply the modulo operation to each element of the list and then add the results to `a`, I'll proceed with that assumption.

Given the initial state and the corrected interpretation of the code, here's the output state:

Initial State: `num` is a list of integers containing at least one non-zero element

Assumed Code:
```python
a = a + sum(x % 10 for x in num)
```

Impact: The value of `a` is updated by adding the sum of the last digits (obtained via `x % 10`) of each element in the list `num`.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers containing at least one non-zero element; `a` is updated to its original value plus the sum of the last digits of each element in `num`.**

This means that the list `num` remains unchanged, and the variable `a` is updated to reflect the addition of the sum of the last digits of each element in `num`.
