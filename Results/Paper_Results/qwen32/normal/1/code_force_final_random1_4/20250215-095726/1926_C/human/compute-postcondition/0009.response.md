The provided code snippet contains a logical error because `num` is described as a list of integers, but the operation `int(num / 10)` assumes `num` is a single integer. However, interpreting the intention behind the code, it seems like the operation should be applied to each element of the list `num`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's assume the intention is to perform the division operation on each element of the list `num`. Hereâ€™s the corrected interpretation and calculation:

Initial State: `num` is a non-empty list of integers with each element's last digit removed, `a` is updated to its original value plus the sum of the last digits of each element in the original `num`.

Since the code snippet provided does not affect `a` and only modifies `num`, we'll focus on how `num` changes. The operation `int(num / 10)` is intended to remove the last digit from each element of the list `num`.

Let's assume the original list `num` was `[123, 456, 789]` and after removing the last digit, `num` became `[12, 45, 78]`. The variable `a` was updated to its original value plus the sum of the last digits (3 + 6 + 9 = 18).

Now, applying the operation `int(num / 10)` to each element of the list `num`:
- For `12`, `int(12 / 10)` results in `1`.
- For `45`, `int(45 / 10)` results in `4`.
- For `78`, `int(78 / 10)` results in `7`.

Thus, the new list `num` becomes `[1, 4, 7]`.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers [1, 4, 7]; `a` is updated to its original value plus the sum of the last digits of each element in the original `num`.**
