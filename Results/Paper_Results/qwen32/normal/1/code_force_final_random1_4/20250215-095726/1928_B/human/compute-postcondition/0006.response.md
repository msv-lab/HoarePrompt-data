The value of `tem` is updated to be the product of its current value and `arr[i]`. Given that initially `tem` is `arr[0]` and `i` is `0`, `tem` is effectively squared (`tem * tem` or `arr[0] * arr[0]`). The values of `arr`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is a list containing the element `tem`, `tem` is `arr[0] * arr[0]`, `i` is `0`**.
