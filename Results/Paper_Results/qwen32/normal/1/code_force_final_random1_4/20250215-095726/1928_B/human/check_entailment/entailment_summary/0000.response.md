### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its functions to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal in the array after adding a permutation of numbers from 1 to n to the array.

#### Key Points:
- We have multiple test cases.
- For each test case, we get an array `a` of length `n`.
- We need to add a permutation `p` of numbers `[1, 2, ..., n]` to `a` such that the resulting array has the maximum frequency of any single element.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The main logic is in the loop:
```python
for _ in range(func_1()):
    n = func_1()
    arr = sorted(list(set(func_3())))
    m = max(arr)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        a = bisect_left(arr, arr[i] + n)
        d = a - i
        ans = max(ans, d)
    print(ans)
```

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1()` is used to read the number of test cases and the size of the array `n`.
   - `func_3()` is used to read the array elements and convert them to a list of integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The array is deduplicated (`set(arr)`) and sorted.
   - For each unique element in the sorted array, the code calculates the number of elements that can be transformed to the same value by adding a permutation.
   - `bisect_left(arr, arr[i] + n)` finds the position where `arr[i] + n` would fit in the sorted array. This helps in determining how many elements can be made equal to `arr[i] + k` for some `k` in the permutation.
   - The difference `a - i` gives the count of elements that can be made equal to `arr[i] + k`.

3. **Output:**
   - The maximum count of elements that can be made equal is printed for each test case.

#### Verification Against Example:
Let's verify the code against the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2`, `1 2`
   - Deduplicated and sorted array: `[1, 2]`
   - For `1`: `bisect_left([1, 2], 1 + 2) = 2`, so `d = 2 - 0 = 2`
   - For `2`: `bisect_left([1, 2], 2 + 2) = 2`, so `d = 2 - 1 = 1`
   - Maximum `ans` is `2`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `4`, `7 1 4 1`
   - Deduplicated and sorted array: `[1, 4, 7]`
   - For `1`: `bisect_left([1, 4, 7], 1 + 4) = 2`, so `d = 2 - 0 = 2`
   - For `4`: `bisect_left([1, 4, 7], 4 + 4) = 3`, so `d = 3 - 1 = 2`
   - For `7`: `bisect_left([1, 4, 7], 7 + 4) = 3`, so `d = 3 - 2 = 1`
   - Maximum `ans` is `2`.

The results match the expected output, indicating the logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
