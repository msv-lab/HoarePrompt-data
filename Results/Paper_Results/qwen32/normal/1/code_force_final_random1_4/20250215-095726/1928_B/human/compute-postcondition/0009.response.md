The value of `tem` is updated by multiplying its current value with `arr[i]`. Given the initial state, `tem` is initially `arr[0] * arr[0]`, and `i` is `1`. Therefore, `tem` becomes `arr[0] * arr[0] * arr[1]`.

The other variables (`arr`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `arr[0] * arr[0]`, `tem` is `arr[0] * arr[0] * arr[1]`, `i` is `1`**.
