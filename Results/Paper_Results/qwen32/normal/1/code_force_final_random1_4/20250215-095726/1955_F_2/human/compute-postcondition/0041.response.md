Functionality: **The function accepts four integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. It processes these counts for each of the \( t \) test cases provided, where \( 1 \le t \le 10^4 \). The function returns a result based on these counts for each test case.**
