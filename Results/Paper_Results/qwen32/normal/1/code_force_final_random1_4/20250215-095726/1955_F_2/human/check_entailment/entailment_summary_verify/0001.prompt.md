You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it computes a result based on these counts and prints the result. The result is determined by checking if exactly three out of the first three counts (ones, twos, threes) are odd, and then adding half the sum of all four counts.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is zero. 

#### Key Observations:
1. XOR of two identical numbers is zero.
2. XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.
3. XOR is commutative and associative, meaning the order of operations does not matter.
4. Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 have the following binary representations:
   - 1: `001`
   - 2: `010`
   - 3: `011`
   - 4: `100`

#### Strategy for Eve:
To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to create sequences where the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. This involves balancing the counts of numbers such that pairs of numbers cancel out their XOR contributions.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution attempts to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. Let's break down the logic:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

#### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Parsing**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
2. **Adjusting Counts**: The line `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))` adjusts the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s to be even. This step seems intended to simplify the problem by focusing on pairs, but it incorrectly modifies the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s without considering the count of 4s.
3. **Checking Odd Counts**: The expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if exactly three of the counts (excluding the count of 4s) are odd. If this condition is true, it adds 1 to the result.
4. **Summing Halved Counts**: The expression `sum(p) // 2` sums up the adjusted counts and divides by 2, which seems to be an attempt to count the number of pairs that can be formed.

### Issues with the Solution:
1. **Incorrect Adjustment of Counts**: The adjustment step `int(x) - int(x) % 2` incorrectly modifies the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s. It should not modify these counts if the goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
2. **Ignoring Count of 4s**: The solution does not correctly handle the count of 4s, which can affect the XOR result.
3. **Incorrect Logic for Bob's Wins**: The logic for determining Bob's wins is flawed. Simply checking if three counts are odd and summing halved counts does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided solution is incorrect. It does not properly account for the counts of all numbers and does not implement the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.
