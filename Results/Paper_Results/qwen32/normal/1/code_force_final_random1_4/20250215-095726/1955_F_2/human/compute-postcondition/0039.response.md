To determine what will be printed, let's break down the problem step-by-step based on the initial state provided:

1. **List `a`**: This list is provided by user input, so its exact contents are unknown. Let's denote it as `[a1, a2, a3, ..., an]`.

2. **Constants**:
   - `p_1 = 5`
   - `p_2 = 5`
   - `p_3 = 5`
   - `p_4 = 6`

3. **Variable `cnt`**:
   - It is calculated as the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in `a`.
   - Additionally, if the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, 1 is added to `cnt`.

Let's express this mathematically:
\[ \text{cnt} = \left(\sum_{x \in a} \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor \right) + \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } a_1 = a_2 = a_3 \text{ and } a_1 \text{ is odd} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \]

Given the above, the exact value of `cnt` depends on the specific values in the list `a`. Since the exact values of `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, we can describe how `cnt` is computed based on the input list `a`.

### Explanation:
- For each element `x` in the list `a`, compute `math.floor(x / 2)`.
- Sum these values.
- Check if the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd. If they are, add 1 to the sum.

### Final Output:
The `print(cnt)` statement will print the calculated value of `cnt` based on the list `a` provided by the user.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of math.floor(x / 2) for all x in a, plus 1 if the first three elements of a are equal and odd)**
