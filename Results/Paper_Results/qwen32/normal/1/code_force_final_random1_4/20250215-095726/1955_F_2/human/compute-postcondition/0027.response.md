In this case, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable here is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use inside the loop. The number of iterations is determined by the integer value obtained from `input()`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a = [5, 5, 5, 6, 7]`
- `p_1 = 5`
- `p_2 = 5`
- `p_3 = 5`
- `p_4 = 6`
- `cnt = 13`

None of these variables (`a`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p_4`, `cnt`) are part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The only thing that needs to be considered is the number of iterations left, which is controlled by the input value.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop, and the loop will continue based on the number of times specified by `int(input())`, we do not need to adjust any of the given variables. The state of the loop control itself is not directly represented in the provided variables.

Therefore, the state remains the same except for the implicit state of how many iterations are left, which is not represented in the given variables.

State: **`a = [5, 5, 5, 6, 7], p_1 = 5, p_2 = 5, p_3 = 5, p_4 = 6, cnt = 13`**
