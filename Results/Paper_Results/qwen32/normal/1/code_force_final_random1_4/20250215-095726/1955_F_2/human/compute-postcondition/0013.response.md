To determine the output of the `print(cnt)` statement, we need to break down the given initial state and the calculation of `cnt`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p_4` are the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours respectively.
- `a` is a list containing these counts: `[p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4]`.
- `cnt` is calculated as the sum of the floor division of each count by 2:
  \[
  cnt = \text{math.floor}(p_1 / 2) + \text{math.floor}(p_2 / 2) + \text{math.floor}(p_3 / 2) + \text{math.floor}(p_4 / 2)
  \]

### Calculation of `cnt`:
- `math.floor(p_1 / 2)` gives the largest integer less than or equal to `p_1 / 2`.
- Similarly, `math.floor(p_2 / 2)`, `math.floor(p_3 / 2)`, and `math.floor(p_4 / 2)` give the largest integers less than or equal to `p_2 / 2`, `p_3 / 2`, and `p_4 / 2` respectively.
- `cnt` is the sum of these four values.

### Final Output Description:
Given the above calculations, `cnt` represents the total number of pairs that can be formed from the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. Since the exact values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `p_4` are not provided, we can only express `cnt` in terms of these variables.

Thus, the output of the `print(cnt)` statement will be:

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of the floor divisions of p_1, p_2, p_3, and p_4 by 2)**
