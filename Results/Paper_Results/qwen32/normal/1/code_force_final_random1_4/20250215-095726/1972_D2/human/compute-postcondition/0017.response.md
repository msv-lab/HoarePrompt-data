The code increments the value of `y` by 1. Since `y` was initially 3, it now becomes 4. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 12, `x` is 1, `y` is 4. If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is increased by 0.75.**
