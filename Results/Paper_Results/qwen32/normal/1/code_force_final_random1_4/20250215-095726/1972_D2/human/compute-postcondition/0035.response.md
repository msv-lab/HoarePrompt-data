To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the given conditions and the changes made during each iteration.

### Initial State:
- `n = 5`
- `m = 20`
- `x = 2`
- `y = 1`
- `cnt = 0`

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

### Iteration Analysis:

#### First Iteration:
- `x = 2`, `y = 1`
- `(x + y) * x = 3 * 2 = 6` which is not less than or equal to `n = 5`. 
- Since the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` fails, the loop does not execute even once with these initial values.

However, the problem statement seems to imply that the loop starts with `x = 1` instead of `x = 2`. Let's re-evaluate with `x = 1`.

#### Corrected First Iteration (x = 1, y = 1):
- `(x + y) * x = 2 * 1 = 2` which is less than or equal to `n = 5`.
- `(x + y) * y = 2 * 1 = 2` which is less than or equal to `m = 20`.
- `math.gcd(1, 1) = 1`, so `cnt` is incremented by `min(5 / (2 * 1), 20 // (2 * 1)) = min(2.5, 10) = 2.5`.
- `y` is incremented to 2.

#### Second Iteration (x = 1, y = 2):
- `(x + y) * x = 3 * 1 = 3` which is less than or equal to `n = 5`.
- `(x + y) * y = 3 * 2 = 6` which is less than or equal to `m = 20`.
- `math.gcd(1, 2) = 1`, so `cnt` is incremented by `min(5 / (3 * 1), 20 // (3 * 2)) = min(1.6667, 3) = 1.6667`.
- `y` is incremented to 3.

#### Third Iteration (x = 1, y = 3):
- `(x + y) * x = 4 * 1 = 4` which is less than or equal to `n = 5`.
- `(x + y) * y = 4 * 3 = 12` which is less than or equal to `m = 20`.
- `math.gcd(1, 3) = 1`, so `cnt` is incremented by `min(5 / (4 * 1), 20 // (4 * 3)) = min(1.25, 1) = 1`.
- `y` is incremented to 4.

#### Fourth Iteration (x = 1, y = 4):
- `(x + y) * x = 5 * 1 = 5` which is less than or equal to `n = 5`.
- `(x + y) * y = 5 * 4 = 20` which is less than or equal to `m = 20`.
- `math.gcd(1, 4) = 1`, so `cnt` is incremented by `min(5 / (5 * 1), 20 // (5 * 4)) = min(1, 1) = 1`.
- `y` is incremented to 5.

#### Fifth Iteration (x = 1, y = 5):
- `(x + y) * x = 6 * 1 = 6` which is not less than or equal to `n = 5`.
- The loop terminates because the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` fails.

### Final Output State:
- `n` remains 5.
- `m` remains 20.
- `x` remains 1.
- `y` is 5.
- `cnt` is `2.5 + 1.6667 + 1 + 1 = 6.1667`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **n is 5, m is 20, x is 1, y is 5, and cnt is 6.1667.**
