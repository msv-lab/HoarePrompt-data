To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1()` does. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine its exact impact on the variables. However, we can assume that `func_1()` might modify the variable `t` or introduce new variables.

Since there is no definition for `func_1()`, let's consider a few possibilities:

1. **If `func_1()` does nothing:**
   - The variable `t` remains unchanged.
   - No new variables are introduced.

2. **If `func_1()` modifies `t`:**
   - Let's assume `func_1()` increments `t` by 1.
   - The new value of `t` would be `t + 1`.

3. **If `func_1()` introduces a new variable `result`:**
   - Let's assume `func_1()` sets `result` to the value of `t`.
   - The new variable `result` would be equal to `t`.

Without knowing the exact implementation of `func_1()`, we can't provide a definitive output state. However, based on common scenarios, here are two possible output states:

### Scenario 1: `func_1()` does nothing
Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**

### Scenario 2: `func_1()` increments `t` by 1
Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input plus 1, where 2 <= `t` <= 10^4 + 1**

### Scenario 3: `func_1()` introduces a new variable `result` equal to `t`
Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `result` is equal to `t`**

Since the exact behavior of `func_1()` is not specified, we cannot determine the precise output state. However, if we assume the simplest case where `func_1()` does nothing, the output state would be:

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
