Let's calculate the new value of `cnt` based on the given code snippet and initial state.

Given:
- `n` is 5
- `m` is 20
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 2
- `cnt` is 2.5 (since the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1)

The code snippet is:
```python
cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

First, compute the two expressions inside the `min` function:

1. `n / ((x + y) * x)`
   - `(x + y)` is `(1 + 2)` which equals `3`
   - `((x + y) * x)` is `(3 * 1)` which equals `3`
   - `n / ((x + y) * x)` is `5 / 3` which equals approximately `1.6667`

2. `m // ((x + y) * y)`
   - `(x + y)` is `(1 + 2)` which equals `3`
   - `((x + y) * y)` is `(3 * 2)` which equals `6`
   - `m // ((x + y) * y)` is `20 // 6` which equals `3` (integer division)

The `min` function will take the smaller of these two values, which is `1.6667`.

Finally, add this value to `cnt`:
- `cnt` was initially `2.5`
- `cnt += 1.6667` results in `cnt` being `4.1667`

Therefore, the updated state is:
Output State: **`n` is 5, `m` is 20, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cnt` is 4.1667**
