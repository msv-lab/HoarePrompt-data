### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function is supposed to handle a single test case with given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes `cnt` to count the number of valid pairs.
   - It iterates over possible values of `x` from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1.
   - It checks if `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` to ensure that potential pairs \((a, b)\) are within bounds.
   - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
   - The final count `cnt` is printed.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Issues in the Code:
- The main issue lies in the logic inside `func_1()`. The loop and conditions are not correctly set up to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem statement.
- The calculation `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` does not correctly reflect the number of valid pairs. It seems to be an attempt to count pairs but is flawed.
- The state mentioned in the comment (`n is 5, m is 20, x is 3, y is 5, and cnt is 2.5`) indicates that the count is not being handled properly (since counts should be integers).

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\). However, due to the constraints (\(n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\)), a brute-force approach would be inefficient. A more optimized approach involving number theory and efficient iteration might be necessary.

Given the current implementation, it does not correctly count the valid pairs, and thus, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
