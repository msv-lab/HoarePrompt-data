You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Provided Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1()`
- This function reads a single test case with values \(n\) and \(m\).
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
- It iterates over possible values of \(x\) starting from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
- For each \(x\), it iterates over possible values of \(y\) starting from 1, ensuring that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
- If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments the counter by the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\).

#### Function `func_2()`
- This function reads the number of test cases \(t\).
- For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

### Issues in the Provided Program

1. **Incorrect Iteration Logic**:
   - The loop logic for iterating over \(x\) and \(y\) does not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\). Specifically, the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` restricts the iteration space too narrowly.
   - The program assumes that \(x\) and \(y\) directly correspond to \(a\) and \(b\), but this is not necessarily true for all valid pairs.

2. **Incorrect Counting Logic**:
   - The counting logic inside the loop is flawed. The expression `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then all multiples of \(x\) and \(y\) will form valid pairs, which is not the case.

3. **Handling of GCD**:
   - The program only considers pairs where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). However, the problem requires checking all pairs \((a, b)\) regardless of their GCD, as long as the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\) holds.

### Conclusion
Given the above issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
