The value of `y` is incremented by 1. Initially, `y` is 1, so after the operation, `y` becomes 2. Since the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` (which is 1) and the new `y` (which is 2) is still 1, the condition for `cnt` remains true, and `cnt` retains its value of 2.5. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `m` is 20, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, and if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is 2.5.**
