To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `n` is 6
- `m` is 20
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 2
- `cnt` is 6.1667

We need to ensure that both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are satisfied for the loop to execute again.

Let's evaluate the current values:
1. `(x + y) * x = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`
   - This is not less than or equal to `n` (which is 6), so the first condition is not satisfied.
   
2. `(x + y) * y = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`
   - This is not less than or equal to `m` (which is 20), but since the first condition is already not satisfied, this doesn't matter for ensuring the loop executes.

To satisfy the first condition `(x + y) * x <= n`:
- We need `(x + y) * x <= 6`.

Let's try to find suitable values for `x` and `y` that satisfy both conditions:
- Let's decrease `x` and/or `y` to make `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y` smaller.

If we set `x` to 1 and `y` to 2:
- `(x + y) * x = (1 + 2) * 1 = 3 * 1 = 3` (which is <= 6)
- `(x + y) * y = (1 + 2) * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6` (which is <= 20)

Both conditions are now satisfied. Therefore, we need to adjust `x` to 1 and `y` to 2.

State: **`n` is 6, `m` is 20, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cnt` is 6.1667**
