### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:

##### Function `func_1()`
- **Initialization**: Initializes `cnt` to 0 and reads `n` and `m`.
- **Outer Loop**: Iterates over `x` from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
- **Inner Loop**: Iterates over `y` from 1, ensuring \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
- **Condition Check**: Checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
- **Counting Logic**: If the condition is met, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) * y}\).

##### Function `func_2()`
- Reads the number of test cases `t`.
- Calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Issues in the Provided Program:

1. **Incorrect Iteration Space**:
   - The loops iterate over `x` and `y` such that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\). This severely restricts the iteration space and does not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\).
   - For example, if \(n = 10\) and \(m = 10\), the loop might miss pairs like \((3, 6)\) because \((3 + 6) \cdot 3 = 27 > 10\).

2. **Incorrect Counting Logic**:
   - The counting logic `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. It assumes that if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), all multiples of `x` and `y` will form valid pairs, which is not true.
   - The program should check each pair \((a, b)\) individually to see if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\).

3. **Handling of GCD**:
   - The program only considers pairs where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). However, the problem requires checking all pairs \((a, b)\) regardless of their GCD, as long as the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\) holds.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotation shows a state where `n` is 5, `m` is 20, `x` is 3, `y` is 5, and `cnt` is 2.5. This indicates that the program is not correctly counting pairs and is using floating-point division instead of integer division, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The iteration space is too restrictive, the counting logic is flawed, and the handling of GCD is incomplete.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
