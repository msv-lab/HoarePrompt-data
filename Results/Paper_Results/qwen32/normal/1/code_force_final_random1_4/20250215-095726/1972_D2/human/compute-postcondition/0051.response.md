The value of `y` is incremented by 1. Initially, `y` is 3, so after the operation, `y` becomes 4. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` (which is 1) and the new `y` (which is 4) is still 1. Therefore, `cnt` remains 9.1667. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 6, `m` is 20, `x` is 1, `y` is 4, and `cnt` is 9.1667.**
