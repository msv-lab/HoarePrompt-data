Postcondition: **`s` is a list of integers from the input with the first element swapped with the element at index `k-1` and must have at least two elements. `j` is 2, `p` is `len(s) - 2`, `ans1` is the count of elements equal to `h` (with `s[0] != h` condition met) plus elements less than or equal to `h` after the first match, `z` is 1 if any element equal to `h` was found, `n` and `k` are the values from the input, `t` is unchanged, and `i` is `s[1]`. If `h < i` was initially true, `ans` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by 1 (so `ans` becomes 1 if it was initially 0, 2 if it was initially 1, or 3 if it was initially 2).**
