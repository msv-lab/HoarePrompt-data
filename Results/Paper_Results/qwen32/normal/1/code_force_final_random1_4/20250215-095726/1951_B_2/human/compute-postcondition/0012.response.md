The given code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `ind`. This means that the list `ind` will now include the new element `i` at the end of its existing elements.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `a` remains the same as it was initially.
- `x` remains the value of the `k`-th cow's rating in the current test case.
- `ind` now includes the new element `i` appended to its previous contents.
- `c` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two parts: the first part is a list with two integers `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of cows and your cow's index, respectively. The second part is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, where all `a_i` are pairwise different. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `x` is the value of the `k`-th cow's rating in the current test case; `ind` is a list containing the index `i` if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` remains empty, and now includes the new element `i`; `c` is 2 if the condition `c == 2` is met, otherwise `c` remains unchanged; `n` is at least 2; `i` is `i_end + 1`.**
