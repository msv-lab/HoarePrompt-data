The code snippet `ind.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ind`. This means that the list `ind` will now include the current value of `i` as one of its elements. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `ind` was either empty or contained indices where `a[i] > x`. After appending `i`, `ind` will definitely contain `i` as well.

Output State: **`a` is a list where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two parts: the first part is a list with two integers `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of cows and your cow's index, respectively. The second part is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, where all `a_i` are pairwise different. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `x` is the value of the `k`-th cow's rating in the current test case; `ind` is a list containing the index `i` if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, including the current value of `i`; `c` is set to 3 if `a[i] > x` for any `i`, otherwise `c` remains unchanged; `n` is at least 2; `i` is `i_end + 2`. If `c` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
