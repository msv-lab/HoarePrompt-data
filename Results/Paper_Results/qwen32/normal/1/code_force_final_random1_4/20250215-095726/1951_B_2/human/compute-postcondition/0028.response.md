The given code attempts to return `n - 1`, but there is no variable `n` defined in the initial state. The only integer variable defined is `k`, which has a value of 14. Since `n` is not present, it seems there might be a typo or missing information. However, if we assume that `n` was intended to be `k`, then the calculation would proceed as follows:

If `n` is `k` (which is 14), then the program would return `14 - 1`.

Output State: **The program returns 13**.
