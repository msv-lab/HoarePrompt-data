To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans, ans1))` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the roles of the variables involved.

### Variables and Their Roles:
- `j`: Index of the last element checked minus one.
- `p`: Set to the value of `j`.
- `ans1`: Count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` and meet specific conditions within the loop.
- `z`: Binary flag (1 or 0) indicating if any element in `s[1:]` equals `h` and `s[0]` does not equal `h`.
- `ans`: Another variable (its value is not explicitly described but it's part of the comparison).
- `h`: A threshold value used in the comparison.
- `s`: A list of elements being checked.
- `t`, `n`, `k`: These variables are mentioned but their specific roles are not detailed in the initial state.

### Analysis:
The `print(max(ans, ans1))` statement will output the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1`.

- `ans1` is a count of elements in `s[1:]` that satisfy certain conditions related to being less than or equal to `h`.
- `ans` is another variable whose value is not explicitly described but is part of the comparison.

Without knowing the exact values of `ans` and `ans1`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be the greater of the two values `ans` and `ans1`.

Output: **max(ans, ans1) (where ans is the value of ans and ans1 is the count of elements in s[1:] that are less than or equal to h and meet the conditions specified in the loop)**
