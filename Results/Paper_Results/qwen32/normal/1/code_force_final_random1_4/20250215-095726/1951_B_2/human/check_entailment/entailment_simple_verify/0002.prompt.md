You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Initial Setup**: We have `n` cows with distinct ratings. The cow at position `k` is owned by us.
2. **Tournament Rules**: 
   - The first match is between cows at positions 1 and 2.
   - Each subsequent match is between the winner of the previous match and the cow in the next position.
   - The cow with the higher rating wins.
3. **Objective**: Maximize the number of wins for the cow at position `k` by optionally swapping it with another cow exactly once.

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cows) and `k` (position of our cow).
   - It then reads the list of ratings `s`.

2. **Strategy**:
   - The code considers two strategies:
     1. **No Swap**: Place the cow at position `k` at the start and see how many matches it can win.
     2. **Swap**: Swap the cow at position `k` with another cow and see how many matches it can win.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - **No Swap Strategy**:
     - Swap the cow at position `k` with the cow at position 1.
     - Simulate the tournament starting from this new arrangement.
     - Count the number of matches won by the cow originally at position `k`.
     - Restore the original arrangement.
   - **Swap Strategy**:
     - Identify the point where the cow at position `k` would lose if placed at the start (`p`).
     - Swap the cow at position `k` with the cow at position `p`.
     - Simulate the tournament starting from this new arrangement.
     - Count the number of matches won by the cow originally at position `k`.
     - Print the maximum number of wins between the two strategies.

### Issues in the Code
1. **No Swap Strategy**:
   - The logic correctly places the cow at position `k` at the start and simulates the tournament.
   - However, it incorrectly restores the original arrangement after counting the wins, which affects subsequent test cases.

2. **Swap Strategy**:
   - The logic to identify the point `p` where the cow at position `k` would lose is flawed.
   - The logic to simulate the tournament after swapping with the cow at position `p` is also flawed.
   - The variable `z` is used to track if the highest rating has been encountered, but it doesn't correctly handle the scenario where the cow at position `k` is swapped with a cow that is not the highest rating encountered so far.

### Conclusion
Given the issues in both strategies, the code does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of wins for the cow at position `k`. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
