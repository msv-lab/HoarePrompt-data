The code snippet `ans1 += 1` increments the value of `ans1` by 1. The initial state specifies that `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements, and `i` is the second element in `s`. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `s`, `ans1` is incremented by 1.**
