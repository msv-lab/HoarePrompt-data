Postcondition: **`j` is 0, `p` is -1, `ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h` and meet the conditions specified in the loop, `z` is 1 if any element in `s[1:]` was equal to `h` and `s[0]` was not equal to `h`, otherwise it is 0, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `s` is a list with at least two elements where the first element and the element at index `k-1` have been swapped, `ans` is 0, `h` is equal to `s[0]`, and `i` is greater than `h`.**
