Postcondition: **`s` is a list with at least one element, `j` is `len(s) - 2`, `p` is `len(s) - 2`, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `ans` is `len(s) - 1`, `h` is equal to `s[0]`, and `i` is not equal to `h`. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1; otherwise, `ans1` remains 0.**
