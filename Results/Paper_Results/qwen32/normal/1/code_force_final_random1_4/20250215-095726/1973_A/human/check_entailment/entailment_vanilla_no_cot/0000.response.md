Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Draws**: The formula used to calculate the number of draws (`egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`) does not correctly account for the constraints and logic required to determine the maximum number of draws. This formula can lead to incorrect results or negative values for `egalites`, which should never happen.

2. **Incorrect Check for Total Matches**: The condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` is too restrictive. The total number of matches is not necessarily limited to 3, and `p3` being greater than `total_matchs` is not an invalid scenario in itself. The logic needs to be revised to properly account for the distribution of wins and draws.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle some edge cases correctly. For example, it incorrectly returns `-1` for the input `(0, 2, 3)` when it should be able to determine a valid number of draws.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1` that addresses these issues:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible number of draws
        max_draws = min(p2 - p1, p3 - p2, total_points // 2 - (p3 - p1))
        
        # Calculate the remaining points after accounting for draws
        remaining_points = total_points - 2 * max_draws
        
        # Check if the remaining points can be distributed as wins
        if remaining_points == 2 * (p3 - p1):
            resultats.append(max_draws)
        else:
            resultats.append(-1)
    
    return resultats
```

This corrected function properly calculates the maximum number of draws by considering the constraints and ensuring that the remaining points can be distributed as wins.
