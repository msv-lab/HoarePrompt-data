The code calculates `total_matchs` by performing integer division of `total_points` by 2. The values of `t`, `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `total_points` remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `total_matchs`.

Given that `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and `total_points` could be either even or odd, `total_matchs` will be the integer part of half of `total_points`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples; `p1` is `next_p1`, `p2` is `next_p2`, `p3` is `next_p3`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; If `total_points` is odd, `-1` is appended to `resultats`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`.**
