Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples; `p1` is `next_p1`, `p2` is `next_p2`, `p3` is `next_p3`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`; `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (next_p3 - next_p2) - 2 * (next_p3 - next_p1)`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`. Otherwise, if `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` contains `-1`. Otherwise, if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `next_p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing two elements, both `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` is an empty list if `total_points` is even, and includes an additional element `egalites // 2`.**
