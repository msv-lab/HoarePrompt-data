The code appends `-1` to the `resultats` list. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple.
- `total_points` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `resultats` is a list containing the single element `-1` if `total_points` is odd, otherwise `resultats` is an empty list.
- `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`.
- Additionally, either `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p_3` is greater than `total_matchs`.

After executing the line `resultats.append(-1)`, the `resultats` list will now contain two elements: `-1` (the initial element) and `-1` (the newly appended element).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple; `total_points` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`; `resultats` is a list containing two elements, both `-1`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`; additionally, either `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p_3` is greater than `total_matchs`.**
