The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the flow of the program. As a result, none of the variables (`t`, `cas_de_test`, `total_points`, `resultats`, `total_matchs`) are modified.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple; `total_points` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`; `resultats` is a list containing two elements, both `-1`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`; additionally, either `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p_3` is greater than `total_matchs`.**
