Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment to determine if the program is correct based on the problem description and the function summary.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Total Points Check**: The program correctly checks if the total points are even. This is necessary because points are awarded in pairs (2 for a win, 1+1 for a draw). If the total points are odd, it is impossible to distribute them according to the rules, so the program correctly returns `-1`.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**: The program calculates the total number of matches by dividing the total points by 2. This is correct since each match contributes either 2 points (for a win) or 2 points (for a draw).

3. **Constraints Check**:
   - The condition `if total_matchs > 3` is incorrect. As mentioned in the original assessment, the maximum number of matches is not limited to 3. Three players can play more than 3 matches if they play against each other multiple times.
   - The condition `if p3 > total_matchs` is also incorrect. Player 3's score cannot exceed the total number of matches, but this check alone is insufficient to determine the validity of the scores.

4. **Draws Calculation**: The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is incorrect. This formula does not correctly account for all possible scenarios of wins and draws. Specifically, it does not properly handle the distribution of points among the players.

### Issues Identified:

- **Incorrect Total Matches Constraint**: The condition `if total_matchs > 3` should be removed or corrected to allow for more than 3 matches.
- **Incorrect Draws Calculation Formula**: The formula used to calculate the number of draws is incorrect and does not correctly account for all possible scenarios of wins and draws.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 2`, `p3 = 4`
- Expected Output: `2` (This can be achieved with 2 wins for player 3 and 2 draws among players 1 and 2)
- Actual Output: The program will likely output `-1` due to the incorrect constraints and formula.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Ensure the total points are even.
2. Calculate the total number of matches.
3. Verify the scores are achievable by checking if the points can be distributed among the players in a valid manner.
4. Calculate the maximum number of draws by considering all possible distributions of wins and draws.

### Revised Code:

Here is a revised version of the function that addresses these issues:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matches = total_points // 2
        
        # Check if the scores are achievable
        if p3 > total_matches:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = min(total_matches - (p3 - p2), total_matches - (p3 - p1))
        if max_draws < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(max_draws)
    return resultats
```

### Final Evaluation:

Given the issues identified and the need for a revised approach, the original program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
