### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to ensure it correctly determines the maximum number of draws or identifies invalid configurations.

1. **Total Points Check**:
   - The sum of the scores (`total_points`) must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (if there's a winner and a loser) or 2 points (if it's a draw).
   - If `total_points` is odd, the configuration is invalid, and the program correctly appends `-1` to the results.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - Since each match contributes 2 points, the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) is `total_points // 2`.
   - The program checks if `total_matchs` exceeds 3, which is the maximum possible number of matches among three players (each player can play with the other two players, resulting in 3 unique matches).
   - It also checks if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than `total_matchs`. This ensures that no player has more wins than the total number of matches played.
   - If either condition fails, the configuration is invalid, and the program correctly appends `-1`.

3. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The formula used to calculate the number of draws is `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
     - `2 * (p3 - p2)` accounts for the points difference between the highest and second-highest scores, assuming these points come from wins.
     - `2 * (p3 - p1)` accounts for the points difference between the highest and lowest scores, again assuming these points come from wins.
     - Subtracting these from `total_points` leaves the points that must have come from draws.
   - If `egalites` is negative, it means the calculated draws are not possible, indicating an invalid configuration.
   - Otherwise, the number of draws is `egalites // 2` because each draw contributes 2 points.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where no games were played (`0 0 0`), resulting in `0` draws.
   - It correctly identifies invalid configurations, such as `0 2 3` or `1 1 10`, by appending `-1`.

### Conclusion:

After carefully reviewing the logic and edge cases, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality. It accurately determines the maximum number of draws or identifies invalid configurations based on the given constraints.
