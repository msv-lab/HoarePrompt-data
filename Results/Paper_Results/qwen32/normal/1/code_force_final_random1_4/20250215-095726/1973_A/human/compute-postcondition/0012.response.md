The given code calculates the value of `egalites` based on the existing variables `total_points`, `p3`, `p2`, and `p1`. The values of `t`, `cas_de_test`, `total_points`, `total_matchs`, and `resultats` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified.

Let's compute the new value of `egalites`:

- `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.

Given the initial conditions, the updated state will include the newly computed value of `egalites`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple; `total_points` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p_3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing two elements, both `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` remains unchanged as a list containing the single element `-1` if `total_points` is odd, or an empty list if `total_points` is even; `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.**
