Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `cas_de_test`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers representing the scores of three players in each test case. The function returns a list `resultats` containing integers. Each integer in `resultats` is either -1, indicating an invalid configuration, or a non-negative integer representing the number of matches that ended in a draw for the corresponding test case.**
