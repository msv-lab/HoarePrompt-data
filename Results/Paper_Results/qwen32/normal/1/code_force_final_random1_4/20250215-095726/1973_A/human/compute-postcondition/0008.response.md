Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, `total_points` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `resultats` is a list containing the single element `-1` if `total_points` is odd, otherwise `resultats` is an empty list, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. Additionally, either `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p_3` is greater than `total_matchs`.**
