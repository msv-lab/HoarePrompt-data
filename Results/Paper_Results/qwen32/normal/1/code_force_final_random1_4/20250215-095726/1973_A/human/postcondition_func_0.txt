The function takes an integer `t` and a list of tuples `cas_de_test`, where each tuple contains three integers representing the scores of three players. It returns a list of integers where each integer is either -1 (indicating an invalid configuration) or a non-negative integer representing the number of matches that ended in a draw for the corresponding test case.
