To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each tuple in the `cas_de_test` list and appends results to the `resultats` list based on specific conditions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
   - `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`) such that `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`.
   - `resultats` starts as an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in `cas_de_test`:
     - Calculate `total_points` as `p1 + p2 + p3`.
     - Check if `total_points` is odd. If so, append `-1` to `resultats` and continue to the next tuple.
     - Calculate `total_matchs` as `total_points // 2`.
     - If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, append `-1` to `resultats` and continue to the next tuple.
     - Calculate `egalites` as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
     - If `egalites` is less than 0, append `-1` to `resultats`.
     - Otherwise, append `egalites // 2` to `resultats`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After processing all tuples in `cas_de_test`, `resultats` will contain a series of integers, each corresponding to the result of the conditions applied to each tuple.

Given the information provided, the final output state of `resultats` after all iterations can be described as follows:

- `resultats` will be a list of integers where each integer represents the outcome of processing each tuple in `cas_de_test` according to the specified rules.

Let's formalize this understanding into the required format:

Output State: **resultats is a list of integers where each integer is either -1 (indicating an invalid configuration) or a non-negative integer representing the number of matches that ended in a draw.**

This output state reflects the final state of the `resultats` list after all iterations of the loop have completed, with each element determined by the conditions specified in the loop body.
