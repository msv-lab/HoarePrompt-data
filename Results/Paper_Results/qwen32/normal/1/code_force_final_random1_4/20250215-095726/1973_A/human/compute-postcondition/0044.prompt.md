Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and cas_de_test is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, representing the scores of the three players in each test case; resultats is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for p1, p2, p3 in cas_de_test:
    total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
    if total_points % 2 != 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    total_matchs = total_points // 2
    if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
    if egalites < 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
    else:
        resultats.append(egalites // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple; `total_points` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`; `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` contains `-1`. Otherwise, if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p_3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing two elements, both `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing the single element `-1` if `total_points` is odd, or an empty list if `total_points` is even, and now includes an additional element `egalites // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples; `p1` is `next_p1`, `p2` is `next_p2`, `p3` is `next_p3`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `total_matchs` is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`; `egalites` is recalculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` contains `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` includes `egalites // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples; `p1` is `next_p1`, `p2` is `next_p2`, `p3` is `next_p3`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`; `egalites` is `3*(p1 + p2 - p3)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, `-1` is appended to `resultats`. Otherwise, `resultats` includes the new value `egalites // 2`. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `-1` is appended to `resultats` regardless of the value of `egalites`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
