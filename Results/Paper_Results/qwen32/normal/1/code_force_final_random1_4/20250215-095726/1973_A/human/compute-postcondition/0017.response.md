Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple; `total_points` is the sum of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`; `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` contains `-1`. Otherwise, if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p_3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing two elements, both `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing the single element `-1` if `total_points` is odd, or an empty list if `total_points` is even, and now includes an additional element `egalites // 2`.**
