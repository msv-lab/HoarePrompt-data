Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples; `p1` is `next_p1`, `p2` is `next_p2`, `p3` is `next_p3`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `resultats` now includes `-1` appended to its previous contents.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their previous values.
