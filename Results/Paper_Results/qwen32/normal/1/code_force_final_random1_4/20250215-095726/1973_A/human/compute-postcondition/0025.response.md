The code snippet provided is simply `continue`, which is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Given that there is no loop explicitly mentioned in the context, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the flow in the provided initial state.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `next_p1`, `next_p2`, `next_p3`, `total_points`, `total_matchs`, `egalites`, `resultats`) are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples; `p1` is `next_p1`, `p2` is `next_p2`, `p3` is `next_p3`; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `total_matchs` is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`; `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (next_p3 - next_p2) - 2 * (next_p3 - next_p1)`; `resultats` contains `-1`.**
