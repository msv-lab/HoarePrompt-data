Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with more than one element, `A` is False, `set_` is a sorted version of `arr` with more than one element, `i` is 3, `not_c` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Thus, all variables retain their initial values.
