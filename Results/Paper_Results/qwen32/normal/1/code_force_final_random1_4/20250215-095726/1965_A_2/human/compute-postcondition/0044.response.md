The code snippet `l = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into components based on whitespace, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting map object to `l`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `lis`, `test`, or `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from the previous `l`; If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, then the conditions remain as they are. Otherwise, `lis` contains the integer 1 and has a length greater than 1, and `test` is `True`. `i` is incremented by 1.**
