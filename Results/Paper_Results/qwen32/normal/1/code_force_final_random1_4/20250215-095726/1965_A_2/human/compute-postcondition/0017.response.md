The code snippet `A = not A` flips the boolean value of `A`. Given that `A` was initially `True`, after executing the code, `A` will become `False`.

The other variables (`arr`, `set_`, `i`, and `not_c`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with more than one element, `A` is False, `set_` is a sorted version of `arr` with more than one element, `i` is 2. If `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, then `not_c` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `not_c` remains unchanged.**
