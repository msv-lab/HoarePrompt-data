Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements and examples.

### Analysis:

The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the optimal moves of two players, Alice and Bob, given the rules of the game. The game revolves around the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) in combinatorial game theory. Specifically, the game described here is a variant of the Nim game where the operation is to subtract the same number from all non-empty piles.

#### Key Points:
1. **Game Rules**: Players take turns removing a positive number of stones from each non-empty pile. The player who cannot make a move loses.
2. **Winning Strategy**: The game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum). If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero at the start, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy; otherwise, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy.
3. **Implementation**: The program should compute the XOR of all pile sizes and determine the winner based on whether the result is zero or not.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles `arr`.
- It then calls `func_1(arr)` to determine the winner.
- The function `func_1(arr)` seems to be trying to determine the winner but does not correctly implement the XOR-sum logic.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The function `func_1(arr)` incorrectly determines the winner based on the sorted unique pile sizes rather than computing the XOR-sum of the pile sizes.
- The condition `if arr[0] != 1: return 'Alice'` is arbitrary and does not follow the rules of the game.
- The loop that checks the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted unique pile sizes (`set_`) is also incorrect and does not reflect the game's rules.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the XOR-sum of the pile sizes. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
