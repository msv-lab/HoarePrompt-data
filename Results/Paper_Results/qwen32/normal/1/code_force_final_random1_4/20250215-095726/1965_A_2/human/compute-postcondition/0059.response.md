Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is another input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `test` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bob')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It prints the string `'Bob'`.

The variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, `j`, and `test` are mentioned in the initial state but they do not affect the execution of this specific `print` statement. The `print` statement does not reference any of these variables; it simply outputs the string `'Bob'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Bob**
