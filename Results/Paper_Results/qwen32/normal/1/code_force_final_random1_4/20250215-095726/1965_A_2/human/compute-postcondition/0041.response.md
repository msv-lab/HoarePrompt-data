Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, then the conditions remain as they are. Otherwise, `lis` contains the integer 1 and has a length greater than 1, and `test` is `True`.**
