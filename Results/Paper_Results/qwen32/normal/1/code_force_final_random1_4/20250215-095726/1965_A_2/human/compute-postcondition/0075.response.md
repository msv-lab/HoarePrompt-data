Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. This means `t` could be any integer within this range, but its specific value does not affect the print statement.
- `n` is another input integer. Again, its specific value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input. The specific integers in `l` do not influence the print statement.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that has an odd number of elements and must have at least 4 elements. The contents of `lis` are also irrelevant to the print statement.
- `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` does not affect the print statement.
- `test` is set to `True`. The value of `test` does not affect the print statement either.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'Alice'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **Alice**
