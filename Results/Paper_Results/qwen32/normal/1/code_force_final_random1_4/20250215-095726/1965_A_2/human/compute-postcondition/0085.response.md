Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`) mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

### Explanation:
The value to be printed is explicitly given in the `print` statement. There are no calculations or conditions that need to be evaluated to determine the output.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
