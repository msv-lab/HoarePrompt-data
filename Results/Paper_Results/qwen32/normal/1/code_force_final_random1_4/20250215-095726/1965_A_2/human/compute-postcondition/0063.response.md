Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and `test` is False; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
