The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range it iterates over, which is determined by `len(set_)`. Since the loop iterates from 1 to `len(set_) - 1`, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 3. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `len(set_)`.

Given the information, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with more than one element, `A` is False, `set_` is a sorted version of `arr` with more than one element, `i` is 3. If `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, then `not_c` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `not_c` remains unchanged.**
