The code snippet `n = int(input())` will read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `n`. Given that the initial state specifies `n` is already an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100`, the new value of `n` will be whatever integer the user inputs within this range. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `num`, `t`, and `v`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 (as per user input), `start` is an integer initialized to -1, `end` is a float initialized to 1000000000.0, `num` is a list that will store integers, `t` is an integer that represents the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3), and `v` is an integer representing the value associated with the constraint.**
