Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is the second integer from the input if `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`; otherwise, `start` remains -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `t` is the first integer from the input, and `v` is the second integer from the input.**
