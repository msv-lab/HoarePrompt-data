The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `t` and `v`. This means the values of `t` and `v` will be updated based on the input provided, while the other variables (`n`, `start`, `end`, and `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input.**
