Output State: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing at least one element, `count_num` is 0, and `i` is either less than `start` or greater than `end`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration in a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
