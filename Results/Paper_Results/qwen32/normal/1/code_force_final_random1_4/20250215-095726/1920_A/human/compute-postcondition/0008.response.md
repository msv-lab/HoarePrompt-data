Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is the second integer from the input, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `t` is 1, `v` is the second integer from the input.**

In simple terms, the value of `start` has been updated to be the same as `v`, which is the second integer from the input. All other variables retain their original values.
