The given code snippet initializes a new variable `count_num` to 0. This does not affect the existing variables `start`, `end`, and `num`. Therefore, the output state retains the preconditions for `start`, `end`, and `num` while adding the new variable `count_num`.

Output State: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, and `num` contains all `v` when `t` is 3; `count_num` is 0.**
