The given code snippet appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. Since no other variables are modified, their states remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `t` equals 3, which does not affect the operation of appending `v` to `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `t` is 3, `start` is -1, `num` is a list containing `v`, and `end` is 1000000000.0 unless `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, in which case `end` is set to `v`.**
