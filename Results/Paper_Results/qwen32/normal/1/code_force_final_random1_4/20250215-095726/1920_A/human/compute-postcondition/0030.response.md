The code assigns the values from the input to the variables `t` and `v`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet provided. The variable `i` was mentioned to be incremented by 1 in the initial state, but there is no operation in the given code that affects `i` further. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `t` and `v` derived from the input, while `n` retains its original value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `i` is incremented by 1; `t` and `v` are integers obtained from the input**.
