To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider how the variables `start`, `end`, and `num` evolve based on the inputs provided during each iteration. Here's a breakdown of the process:

- **`start`**: This variable is initially set to `-1`. It gets updated to the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is `1` and `v` is greater than the current `start`.
- **`end`**: This variable is initially set to `1000000000.0`. It gets updated to the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is `2` and `v` is less than the current `end`.
- **`num`**: This variable is initially an empty list. Values of `v` are appended to this list whenever `t` is `3`.

Let's assume the loop runs `n` times, and during these iterations, we get various combinations of `t` and `v` as input. The final values of `start`, `end`, and `num` will depend on these inputs.

### Final Output State Explanation:
- **`start`**: After all iterations, `start` will hold the highest value of `v` that was encountered when `t` was `1` and `v` was greater than the current `start`.
- **`end`**: After all iterations, `end` will hold the lowest value of `v` that was encountered when `t` was `2` and `v` was less than the current `end`.
- **`num`**: After all iterations, `num` will contain all the values of `v` that were encountered when `t` was `3`.

### Example Calculation:
Suppose `n` is `5` and the inputs are:
1. `t=1`, `v=5`
2. `t=2`, `v=10`
3. `t=3`, `v=15`
4. `t=1`, `v=20`
5. `t=2`, `v=2`

After processing these inputs:
- `start` will be `20` because it's the highest value encountered when `t` was `1`.
- `end` will be `2` because it's the lowest value encountered when `t` was `2`.
- `num` will be `[15]` because `15` is the only value encountered when `t` was `3`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`start` is the highest `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the lowest `v` when `t` is 2, and `num` contains all `v` when `t` is 3.**

This means that after all iterations, `start` will reflect the maximum value from all `v` where `t` was `1`, `end` will reflect the minimum value from all `v` where `t` was `2`, and `num` will be a list of all `v` where `t` was `3`.
