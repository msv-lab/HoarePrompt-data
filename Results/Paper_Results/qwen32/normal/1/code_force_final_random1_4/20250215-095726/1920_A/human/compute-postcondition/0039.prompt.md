Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `t` is an integer that represents the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3), and `v` is an integer representing the value associated with the constraint.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if t == 1:
        if start < v:
            start = v
    if t == 2:
        if end > v:
            end = v
    if t == 3:
        num.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `t` is an integer, `start` is the second integer from the input if `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`; otherwise, `start` remains -1. If `t` is 3, `start` is -1, `num` is a list containing `v`, and `end` is 1000000000.0 unless `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, in which case `end` is set to `v`. If `t` is not 3, `num` remains an empty list and `end` is 1000000000.0 unless `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, in which case `end` is set to `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `t` is the first integer from the input; `v` is the second integer from the input; if `t` is 1 and `start` was less than `v`, then `start` is now equal to `v`; otherwise, `start` remains unchanged; `num` is a list containing `v` or multiple `v` values if `t` is 3; `end` is `v` if `t` is 2 and `end` was greater than `v`; otherwise, `end` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `i` is incremented by 1; `t` and `v` are integers obtained from the input; if `t` equals 1 and `start` was less than `v`, then `start` is updated to the value of `v`; if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v`, then `end` is updated to the value of `v`; if `t` equals 3, then `v` is appended to `num`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
