To understand the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's break down the given code and the described states.

### Code Analysis:
- The loop runs `n - 1` times, where `n` is the number of vertices in the tree.
- In each iteration, two integers `u` and `v` are read from the input.
- These integers are decremented by 1 to convert them into zero-based indices.
- The value `v` is appended to the list at index `u` in `u2vs`.
- The value `u` is appended to the list at index `v` in `u2vs`.

### Loop Iterations:
- After the first iteration, `u2vs` will have `u` and `v` connected as neighbors.
- After the second iteration, another pair of vertices will be connected.
- This continues until `n - 1` pairs of vertices are processed.

### Final Output State:
After all `n - 1` iterations, `u2vs` will represent an adjacency list of an undirected tree with `n` vertices. Each sublist in `u2vs` will contain the indices of all vertices directly connected to the corresponding vertex.

### Natural Language Description:
The final output state is an adjacency list representation of an undirected tree with `n` vertices. Each vertex (represented by its index) has a list of its neighboring vertices. Specifically, `u2vs[i]` will contain all vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i`.

### Formatted Output:
Output State: **`u2vs` is an adjacency list where each sublist `u2vs[i]` contains the indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`.**

This means that after all iterations, `u2vs` will be a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree.
