Postcondition: **`u2vs` is an adjacency list where each sublist `u2vs[i]` contains the indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`. `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as calculated by the BFS. `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is a list of previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices. `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, vk, vk-1, ..., v2, v1, 0]` with the length of `path_ba` being odd. `ops` is an empty list.`**
