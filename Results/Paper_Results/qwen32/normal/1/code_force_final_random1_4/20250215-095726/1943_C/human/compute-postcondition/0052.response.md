The code appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `c` is the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` is 2, the tuple `(c, 2)` is added to `ops`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is an adjacency list where each sublist `u2vs[i]` contains the indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as calculated by the BFS; `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list of previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, vk, vk-1, ..., v2, v1, 0]` with the length of `path_ba` being odd; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)`; `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` which is `len(path_ba) // 2` and must be at least 0; `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`; `i` is 2.`**
