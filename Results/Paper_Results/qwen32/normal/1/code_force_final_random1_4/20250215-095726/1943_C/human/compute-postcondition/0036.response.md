The code appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Given the initial state, `path_ba` initially contains the elements `b` and `n`. After appending `n` again, `path_ba` will now contain `b`, `n`, and `n`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is an adjacency list where each sublist `u2vs[i]` contains the indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as calculated by the BFS; `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list of previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b`, `n`, `n`; `n` is `previous[n]`. If `n` equals -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
