You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: u2vs is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the neighbors of a vertex in a tree, n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and the tree is represented such that vertices are 0-indexed.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]

    #State: `u2vs` is an adjacency list where each sublist `u2vs[i]` contains the indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as calculated by the BFS; `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list of previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, vk, vk-1, ..., v2, v1, 0]`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0), (c, 1), ..., (c, ci)`, where `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` (`len(path_ba) // 2`) and `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd `i` from `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1` with a step of `2`, where `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: len(ops) (where len(ops) is determined by the length of path_ba)
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: transformed elements of `ops` where each element `(x[0], x[1])` is transformed to `x[0] + 1 x[1]` and printed on separate lines
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `u2vs`, which is a list of lists containing integers representing the neighbors of each vertex in a tree, and `n`, which is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree. The function does not return any value (returns `None`).

Return Postconditions: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
