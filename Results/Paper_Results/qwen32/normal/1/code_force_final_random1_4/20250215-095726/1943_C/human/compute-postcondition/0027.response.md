The code snippet assigns the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` to the variable `n`. Given that `path_ba` is a list containing a single element `b`, `path_ba[-1]` refers to `b`. Therefore, `n` is assigned the value of `previous[b]`.

The output state includes the updated value of `n` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is an adjacency list where each sublist `u2vs[i]` contains the indices of all vertices directly connected to vertex `i`; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as calculated by the BFS; `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list of previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `0` to all other vertices; `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`; `n` is `previous[b]`.**
