The code appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. The values of `c1` and `i` are used to form this tuple. Since `c1` is defined as `c2 - 1` and `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, the value of `c1` is determined by the length of `path_ba`. The variable `i` is not defined in the given context, so we assume it is a predefined variable with some value.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ops`, which now contains the new tuple `(c1, i)`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is an adjacency list, `d` is a list of distances, `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of previous vertices, `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, vk, vk-1, ..., v2, v1, 0]` with an even length greater than 2, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c1, i)`, `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`**.
