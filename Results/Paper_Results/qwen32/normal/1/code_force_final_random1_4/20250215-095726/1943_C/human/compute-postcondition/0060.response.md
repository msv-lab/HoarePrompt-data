To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `i`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `u2vs` is an adjacency list.
- `d` is a list of distances.
- `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`.
- `previous` is a list of previous vertices.
- `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`.
- `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, vk, vk-1, ..., v2, v1, 0]` with an even length greater than 2.
- `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`.
- `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`.
- `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

Given that the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, we need to adjust `i` accordingly for the next iteration.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Determine the current value of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 2 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, if the loop just completed an iteration with `i = k`, the next value of `i` should be `k + 2`.

2. **Ensure `i` is within the valid range:**
   - The loop runs as long as `1 <= i < len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of 2.
   - So, for the next iteration, `i + 2` must still satisfy this condition.

Given these points, let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 2`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k` from the provided state, we'll denote the new value of `i` as `k + 2`, ensuring it remains within the valid range.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`u2vs` is an adjacency list, `d` is a list of distances, `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of previous vertices, `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, vk, vk-1, ..., v2, v1, 0]` with an even length greater than 2, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `1 <= k + 2 < len(path_ba) - c1`**
