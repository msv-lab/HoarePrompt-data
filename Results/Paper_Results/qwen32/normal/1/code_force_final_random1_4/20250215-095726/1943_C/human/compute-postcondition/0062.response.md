The given code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Here, `c2` and `i` are already defined based on the initial state.

Output State: **`u2vs` is an adjacency list, `d` is a list of distances, `a` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of previous vertices, `b` holds the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, vk, vk-1, ..., v2, v1, 0]` with an even length greater than 2, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` followed by the newly appended tuple `(c2, i)`, `c2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `1 <= k + 2 < len(path_ba) - c1`.**

In simpler terms, the list `ops` now includes an additional tuple `(c2, i)`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` rounded down, and `i` is calculated as `k + 2` from the previous iteration's `i` value. All other variables remain unchanged.
