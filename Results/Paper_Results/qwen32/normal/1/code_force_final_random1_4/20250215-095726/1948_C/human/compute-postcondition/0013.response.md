Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the input string, `b` is the newly input string of length `n`, and `i` is 3. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
