The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `t` was initially decremented by 1, so its value remains decremented by 1. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer**.
