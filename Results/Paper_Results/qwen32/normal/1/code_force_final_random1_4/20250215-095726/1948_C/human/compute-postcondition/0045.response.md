Postcondition: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is at least 3, `a` is the new string input by the user, `b` is a new string input by the user. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` and both are equal to `<` with `i + 1` being less than `n`, or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` and both are equal to `<`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`.**
