In this task, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('No')
```

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state provides details about variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i`, but none of these variables are used within the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is described as the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.
- `n` is at least 7.
- `a` and `b` are new strings input by the user.
- `i` is set to 7.

Since the `print` statement only outputs the string `'No'`, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are irrelevant to the output.

Output: **No**
