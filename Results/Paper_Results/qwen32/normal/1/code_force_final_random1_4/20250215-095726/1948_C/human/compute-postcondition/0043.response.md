The given initial state provides conditions about the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, but these conditions do not directly influence the content of the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is described as the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. This implies `t` is part of a loop or iterative process, but its value does not affect the print statement.
- `n` is at least 3, providing a minimum length for strings `a` and `b`.
- `a` and `b` are strings input by the user, with specific conditions about their characters matching certain patterns. These conditions do not affect the output of the `print` statement.
- The conditions involving `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` being equal to `<` are constraints on the strings `a` and `b`, but they do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Given this, the `print` statement will output the string `'No'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **No**
