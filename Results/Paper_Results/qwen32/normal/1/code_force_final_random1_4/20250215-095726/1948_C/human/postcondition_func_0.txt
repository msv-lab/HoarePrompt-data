The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length containing only '<' and '>'. It checks if it's possible to pair each '<' in the first string with a '>' in the second string such that each pair is aligned vertically and no two pairs overlap. For each test case, it outputs "YES" if such pairing is possible, otherwise "NO".
