Postcondition: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are strings input by the user. If `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both `<` with `i + 1 < n`, or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both `<`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur to `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`.**
