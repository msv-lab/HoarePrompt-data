Output State: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are strings input by the user, and the loop prints "Yes"**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the user's input. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and the behavior of the loop remain unchanged.
