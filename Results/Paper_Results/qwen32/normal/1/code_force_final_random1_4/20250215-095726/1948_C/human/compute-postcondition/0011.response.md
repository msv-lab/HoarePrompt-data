Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is the input string.
- `b` is the newly input string of length `n`.
- `i` is 3.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'`. None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`) are used within this specific `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'No'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
