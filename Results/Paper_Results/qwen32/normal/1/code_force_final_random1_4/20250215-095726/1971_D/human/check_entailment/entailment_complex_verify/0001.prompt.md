You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string s consisting of characters '0' and '1' such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())

        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: `i` is `t`, `s` is the last input string, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is the final count for the last test case, `flag` is `True` if there was a '01' transition in the last test case, otherwise `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1'. It then calculates and prints the number of segments in the string `s` where consecutive characters are different, reducing the count by one if there is at least one '01' transition in the string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We are given a binary string and we need to determine the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) we can cut the string into such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Key Observations

1. **Sorted Binary String**: The target is a string where all '0's come before all '1's.
2. **Contiguous Substrings**: Each piece must be a contiguous substring of the original string.
3. **Minimum Pieces**: We want the minimum number of such pieces.

### Strategy

To achieve the sorted order with the minimum number of pieces, we need to identify transitions from '0' to '1'. Each transition indicates a potential cut point because we need to separate groups of '0's and '1's.

- If the string starts with '0's and ends with '1's, every time we encounter a '1' following a '0', it suggests a new piece starting with '1'.
- However, if the string starts with '1's and ends with '0's, the logic is reversed, but the core idea remains the same: count the transitions.
- If there are no transitions (i.e., the string is already sorted), we need just one piece.

### Provided Solution Analysis

The provided solution attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the string and counting transitions from '0' to '1'. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `count` is initialized to 1 because even if there are no transitions, we need at least one piece.
   - `flag` is used to check if there is at least one '0' followed by a '1'.

2. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - For each character in the string (except the last one), it checks if the current character is different from the next one.
   - If they are different, it increments the `count` by 1.
   - If the current character is '0' and the next one is '1', it sets the `flag` to `True`.

3. **Adjust Count Based on Flag**:
   - After the loop, if the `flag` is `True`, it decrements the `count` by 1. This adjustment seems unnecessary and incorrect because the initial `count` should already account for the necessary pieces correctly.

### Issues in the Provided Solution

- **Incorrect Adjustment**: The decrement of `count` based on the `flag` is not logically sound. The `count` should reflect the actual number of pieces needed without any additional adjustments.
- **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases explicitly, such as strings consisting entirely of '0's or '1's, which should return `1` as expected.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the provided solution is not correct. Specifically, the adjustment based on the `flag` is problematic and can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
