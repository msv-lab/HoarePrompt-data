Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1'. It then calculates and prints the number of segments in the string `s` where consecutive characters are different, reducing the count by one if there is at least one '01' transition in the string.**
