Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the newly input string; `count` is 1; `flag` is True if there is at least one '01' pattern in the original `s`; `j` is `len(original s) - 1`; `i` is `i+1`.**

Explanation: The value of `count` has been set to 1, while the other variables (`t`, `s`, `flag`, `j`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
