To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `j < len(s) - 1`. The variables involved in this condition are `j` and `len(s)`.

Here's the analysis:

- `j` is currently set to 0.
- `len(s)` is the length of the string `s`.

For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `len(s) - 1`. Given that `j` is 0, `len(s) - 1` must be greater than 0. This means that `len(s)` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is the length of the string `s`. It must be ensured that `s` has more than one character.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the newly input string and `len(s)` must be greater than 1; `count` is 1; `flag` is False; `j` is 0; `i` is `i+1`.**
