Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input where `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + int(((n // 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `(n // 2) - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables retain their initial values.
