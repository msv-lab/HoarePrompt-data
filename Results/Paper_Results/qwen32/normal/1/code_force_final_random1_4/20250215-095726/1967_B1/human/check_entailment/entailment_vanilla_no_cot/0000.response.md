Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic within the loop and the way it calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` is flawed. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Here's a brief analysis of why the program is incorrect:

1. The variable `count` starts at 2 and increments by 1 in each iteration, but this doesn't correctly represent the possible values of `b`.
2. The variable `g` is calculated as `int(n / count)`, which doesn't directly relate to the number of valid `a` values for a given `b`.
3. The condition `if g < countmins: break` is not logically sound for the problem requirements.
4. The calculation `ans += int(g / count) + 1` does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs for each `b`.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m` and then determine the number of valid `a` values for each `b` that satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This typically involves using properties of the greatest common divisor and possibly some mathematical insights to efficiently count the valid pairs.

A correct solution would look something like this:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        total_pairs = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    total_pairs += 1
        print(total_pairs)

func()
```

However, this naive approach might be too slow for the given constraints (`n, m â‰¤ 2 * 10^6`). An optimized approach would be necessary to handle the large input sizes efficiently.
