Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to determine the new state after executing the line `g -= countmins`.

Initial State:
- `i` is `x+3`
- `t` is greater than `x+3`
- `n` is `a`
- `m` is at least 4
- `count` is 4
- `ans` is `a + int((int(a / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1 + int(g / count) + 1`
- `countmins` is 3
- `g` is `int(a / 4)`
- If `g` is less than `countmins`, the state remains unchanged.

The line `g -= countmins` means we subtract `countmins` from `g`.

Since `countmins` is 3, the new value of `g` will be `g - 3`. However, we must consider the condition that if `g` is less than `countmins`, the state remains unchanged. This means if `g` is initially less than 3, it will not change.

Let's consider the two cases:
1. If `g` is initially less than 3, the state remains unchanged.
2. If `g` is initially 3 or more, `g` will be updated to `g - 3`.

Given `g` is `int(a / 4)`, we need to consider the value of `a`:
- If `a < 12`, then `g` will be less than 3 (since `int(a / 4)` will be 0, 1, or 2).
- If `a >= 12`, then `g` will be 3 or more (since `int(a / 4)` will be 3 or more).

Therefore, the output state will depend on the value of `a`:
- If `a < 12`, the state remains unchanged.
- If `a >= 12`, `g` will be updated to `g - 3`.

To provide a specific output state, let's assume `a` is such that `g` is initially 3 or more (since the problem does not specify a particular value for `a` and we need to cover the case where `g` changes).

Output State: **`i` is `x+3`; `t` is greater than `x+3`; `n` is `a`; `m` is at least 4; `count` is 4; `ans` is `a + int((int(a / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1 + int((int(a / 4) - 3) / count) + 1`; `countmins` is 3; `g` is `int(a / 4) - 3`**.
