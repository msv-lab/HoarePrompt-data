The value of `count` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `x+3`; `t` is greater than `x+3`; `n` is `a`; `m` is at least 4; `count` is 5; `ans` is `a + int((int(a / 2) - 1) / 2) + 2 + int((int(a / 4) - 3) / 4) + int((int(a / 4) - 3) / count)`; `countmins` is 3; `g` is `int(a / 4) - 3`**
