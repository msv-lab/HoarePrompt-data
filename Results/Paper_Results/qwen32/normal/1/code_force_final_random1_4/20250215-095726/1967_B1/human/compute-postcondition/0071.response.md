Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value (so if it was `x`, it is now `x+2`); `t` is greater than the new value of `i`; `n` is `a`; `m` is at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is `a`; `countmins` is `1`; `g` is `int(a / 2)`; `g` is less than `countmins` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
