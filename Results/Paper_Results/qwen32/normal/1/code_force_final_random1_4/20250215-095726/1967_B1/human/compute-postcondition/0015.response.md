The code snippet `countmins = int(count - 1)` updates the value of `countmins`. Given that `count` is initially 3, `count - 1` equals 2, and converting it to an integer remains 2. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input where `m` must be at least 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + int(((n // 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `(n // 2) - 1`**.
