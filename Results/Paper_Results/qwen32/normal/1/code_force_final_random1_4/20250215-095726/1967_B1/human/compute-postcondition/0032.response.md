The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_end`) and `t` is a value that must be greater than `i_end` for the loop to continue. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than `i_end + 1`.

State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `t` must be greater than `i_end + 1`**

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i_end`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` must be greater than the new value of `i`**
