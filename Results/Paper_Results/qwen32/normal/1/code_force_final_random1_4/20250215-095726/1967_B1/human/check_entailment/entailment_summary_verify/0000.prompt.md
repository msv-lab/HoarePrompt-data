You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m`. It then computes and prints a specific value `ans` for each test case based on the given logic involving `n` and `m`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and see if it meets the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

### Potential Issues:
1. **Initialization of `ans`:** The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This seems to assume that for every `b=1`, all values of `a` from `1` to `n` are valid. This is true because for `b=1`, \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\). However, this initialization alone does not cover all cases for other values of `b`.

2. **Loop for `count`:** The loop starts from `count=2` and goes up to `m`. For each `count`, it calculates `g` as `int(n / count)` which represents the maximum value of `a` such that `a / count` is an integer. It then subtracts `count - 1` from `g` and checks if the result is non-negative. If it is, it adds `int(g / count) + 1` to `ans`.

3. **Logic for `g`:** The logic inside the loop seems to be attempting to count valid pairs `(a, b)` for each `b` from `2` to `m`. However, the calculation of `g` and the subsequent steps do not directly align with the problem requirement of checking whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program initializes `ans` to `n` correctly to account for all pairs where `b=1`. It then iterates through possible values of `b` from `2` to `m`, calculating the number of valid `a` values for each `b` using the derived formula. The program passes all provided test cases and additional edge cases, indicating that it correctly implements the required logic.
