The value of `g` is reassigned to `int(n / count)`. Given that `count` is 4, `g` now holds the value `int(n / 4)`. All other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input where `m` must be greater than 4; `count` is 4; `ans` is `n + int(((n // 2) - 1) / 2) + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 2`; `countmins` is 3; `g` is `int(n / 4)`**.
