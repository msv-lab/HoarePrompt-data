You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Order of Cards:**
   - First, Vladislav lays down all the odd-numbered cards in ascending order.
   - Then, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number in ascending order.
   - This pattern continues with multiples of 3, 4, and so on, until all cards are laid down.

2. **Objective:**
   - For each test case, determine the k-th card laid down according to the above rules.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (total number of cards) and `k` (the position of the card to find).

2. **Generating the Sequence of Multiples:**
   - The list `L` is constructed to represent the count of cards laid down at each step.
   - The loop `while n:` calculates how many odd numbers can be laid down at each step, reducing `n` accordingly and appending the count to `L`.

3. **Determining the k-th Card:**
   - The variable `tot` keeps track of the total number of cards laid down so far.
   - The variable `pow` represents the current multiplier (starting at 1 for odd numbers).
   - The loop iterates through the counts in `L`, checking if `k` falls within the range of cards laid down at the current step.
   - If `k` is within the current range, the program calculates the k-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` and prints it.

### Correctness Check:
- **Logic of Counting Odd Multiples:**
  - The calculation `(n + 1) // 2` correctly determines the number of odd numbers up to `n`.
  - Subtracting this count from `n` reduces the problem size for subsequent steps.
  
- **Formula for k-th Card:**
  - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` correctly identifies the k-th card in the sequence of multiples.
  - `pow` adjusts for the current multiplier (1 for odd, 2 for multiples of 2, etc.).
  - `(2 * (k - tot) - 1)` finds the correct odd number within the current set of multiples.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles small values of `n` and `k` correctly.
  - It also handles large values of `n` and `k` efficiently due to the logarithmic reduction of `n` in each step.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav according to the specified rules.

**Correctness:** **True**
