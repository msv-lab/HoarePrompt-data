Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` is 1.
- `k` is an integer.
- `L` is a list containing one element, `[1]`.
- `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a` (though `a` is not defined in the initial state, it doesn't affect the current print statement).
- `pow` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

### Analysis:
- `pow` is explicitly given as 1.
- The expression inside the parentheses is `2 * (k - tot) - 1`.

Given that `tot` is less than `k`, the difference `(k - tot)` is a positive integer. Let's denote this difference as `d` where `d = k - tot` and `d > 0`.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[ 2 \times d - 1 \]

Since `pow` is 1, multiplying by `pow` does not change the value. Therefore, the expression evaluates to:
\[ 2 \times (k - tot) - 1 \]

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `2 * (k - tot) - 1`, where `k` is an integer greater than `tot`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 * (k - tot) - 1 (where k is an integer greater than tot)**
