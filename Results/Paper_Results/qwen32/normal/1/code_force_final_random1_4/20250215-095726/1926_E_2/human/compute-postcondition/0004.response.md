To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition specified in the loop head. The loop condition is `while n:` which means the loop will continue as long as `n` is truthy (i.e., non-zero).

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4;
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split into two parts;
- `L` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be a non-zero integer. Since `n` is already described as an integer obtained from the input, we just need to ensure it is not zero.

Therefore, the only adjustment required is to specify that `n` must be non-zero.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` is a non-zero integer; `k` is an integer; `L` is an empty list.**
