Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 1, `k` is an integer, `L` is [1], `pow` is 1. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then `tot` remains unchanged and `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of `tot` and `k` remains as per the precondition.**
