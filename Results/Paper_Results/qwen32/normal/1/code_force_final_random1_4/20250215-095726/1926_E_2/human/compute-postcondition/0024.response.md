The given code snippet multiplies the variable `pow` by 2. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `tot`) are modified by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\)
- `n` is 1
- `k` is an integer
- `L` is [1]
- `pow` is 1
- `tot` is `tot + a` (This seems like a typo or incomplete statement since `a` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `tot` is just some integer value.)

After executing `pow *= 2`, the value of `pow` changes from 1 to 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is 1; `k` is an integer; `L` is [1]; `pow` is 2; `tot` is `tot + a`.**
