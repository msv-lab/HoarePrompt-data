The code snippet `m = (n + 1) // 2` reassigns the value of `m` to `(n + 1) // 2`. However, since `m` was already initialized to `(n + 1) // 2` in the initial state, the value of `m` does not change.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State with respect to the variables mentioned.

Output State: **`t` is 3; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer from the input; `L` is `[(n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2]`; `tot` is 5; `pow` is 8; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
