The code snippet `pow *= 2` multiplies the current value of `pow` by 2. Given that the initial state specifies `pow` is 1, after executing the code, `pow` will be 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains 3; `n` is 0; `k` remains the second integer from the input; `L` is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`; `pow` is 2; `m` is 1; `tot` is increased by `a`. If the new `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to the new `tot + a`, then the condition holds. Otherwise, there is no change to `tot` beyond being increased by `a`.**
