In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the variable `t`. The loop head only contains the underscore `_` and `t`, meaning we can only adjust these two elements to ensure the loop executes.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1 because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `t`.
2. The underscore `_` is a throwaway variable used when the loop variable is not needed inside the loop body, so no specific adjustment is required for `_`.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure that the loop executes. Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), it is already in a valid state for the loop to execute.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are necessary for `_` since it doesn't affect the loop execution.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4**
