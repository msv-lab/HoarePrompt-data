Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The program attempts to calculate the sequence of cards laid down by Vladislav, but it does so in a way that doesn't match the specified order.
2. It uses a list `L` to store intermediate values related to the count of cards at each step, but it doesn't generate the actual sequence of cards.
3. The loop `while n:` and the calculations inside it do not generate the sequence of odd numbers, multiples of 2 times odd numbers, multiples of 3 times odd numbers, etc., as required.
4. The final loop that iterates over `L` attempts to determine which card is the k-th card, but it does so incorrectly by using the values in `L` and the power of 2, which doesn't correspond to the actual sequence of cards.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to generate the sequence of cards in the specified order and then find the k-th card. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        current_multiple = 1
        count = 0
        
        while count < k:
            odd_number = 1
            while True:
                card = current_multiple * odd_number
                if card > n:
                    break
                count += 1
                if count == k:
                    print(card)
                    break
                odd_number += 2
            current_multiple += 1

func()
```

This corrected program generates the sequence of cards in the required order and finds the k-th card efficiently.
