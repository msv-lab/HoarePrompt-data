Postcondition: **`t` remains 3, `n` is 0, `k` remains the second integer from the input, `L` is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, `pow` is 4, `m` is 1, and `tot` is 2, `a` is 1. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the conditions on the variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions on the variables remain unchanged as well.**
