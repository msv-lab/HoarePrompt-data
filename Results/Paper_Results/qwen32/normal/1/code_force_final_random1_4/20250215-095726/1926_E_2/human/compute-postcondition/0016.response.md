To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `n` and `L` until `n` becomes zero.

The loop repeatedly calculates `m` as `(n + 1) // 2`, subtracts `m` from `n`, and appends `m` to the list `L`. This process continues until `n` is reduced to zero.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n`: An integer.
   - `k`: An integer.
   - `L`: An empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - In each iteration, `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - `n` is then updated to `n - m`.
   - `m` is appended to the list `L`.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `n` becomes zero.

Let's analyze the behavior of `n` and `L`:
- Each iteration effectively halves `n` (rounding up if necessary), appending the halved value to `L`.
- The process continues until `n` is reduced to zero.

After all iterations, `n` will be zero, and `L` will contain a series of values that sum up to the original value of `n`.

### Final Output State:
- `t`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- `n`: Becomes 0.
- `k`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- `L`: Contains a list of integers that represent the halved values of `n` at each step until `n` becomes zero.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is 0; `k` is an integer; `L` is a list of integers representing the halved values of the original `n` until `n` becomes zero.**
