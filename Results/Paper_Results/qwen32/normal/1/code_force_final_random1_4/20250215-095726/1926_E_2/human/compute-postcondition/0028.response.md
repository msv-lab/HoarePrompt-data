The code snippet `tot += a` increments the value of `tot` by `a`. Given the initial state, `tot` is initially `tot + a` under certain conditions, but since we are only concerned with the immediate effect of the provided code, we simply add `a` to the current value of `tot`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is 1; `k` is an integer; `L` is [1]; `pow` is 2; `tot` is `tot + a`.**

Natural Language: The value of `tot` is now `tot + a`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
