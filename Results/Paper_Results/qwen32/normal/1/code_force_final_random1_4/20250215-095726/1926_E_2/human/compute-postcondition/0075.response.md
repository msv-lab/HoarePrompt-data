The value of `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` is a non-zero integer from the input, the exact value of `m` depends on the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 3; `n` is a non-zero integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `L` is []; `tot` is 5; `pow` is 8; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
