Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `s` is either the accumulated sum until `d` becomes 0 or `s` reaches `k` (if `k > (n + 1) // 2`) or 0 (otherwise), `i` is the number of iterations the loop ran (if `k > (n + 1) // 2`) or 0 (otherwise), `d` is 0 (if `k > (n + 1) // 2`) or the first integer from the input (otherwise), `h` is \(\left(h_{\text{initial}} - (2^{i-1} - 1)\right) / 2^{i-1}\) (if `k > (n + 1) // 2`) or the first integer from the input (otherwise), `p` is `i` (if `k > (n + 1) // 2`) or 1 (otherwise), `g` is \(\sum_{j=0}^{i-2} \left(\left(h_{\text{initial}} - (2^j - 1)\right) / 2^j\right)\) (if `k > (n + 1) // 2`) or 0 (otherwise), and `f` and `y` are defined as `k - g` and 2 respectively (if `k > (n + 1) // 2`) or not defined (otherwise).**
