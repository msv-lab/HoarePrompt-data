Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is at least 5, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` contains `n` elements (each being an input string), the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `tc` has been incremented by `n`, `impossible` is `False`, `ans` is `'NO'`, `i` is 4**

Explanation: The variable `impossible` has been explicitly set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values as they were not modified by the given code snippet.
