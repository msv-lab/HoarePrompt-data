### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to determine whether it's possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using a series of specified operations. The logic in the program is based on the observation that if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid have different colors, then it might be impossible to make the entire grid uniform unless certain conditions are met along the borders.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid (`n` and `m`).
   - It then reads the grid itself, which consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` characters ('W' or 'B').

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The program assumes initially that it is possible to make the entire grid the same color (`ans = 'YES'`).

3. **Checking Corner Colors:**
   - If the color of the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) is different from the color of the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`), the program proceeds to check if it is still possible to make the grid uniform.
   
4. **Border Checks:**
   - The program checks if there are any adjacent cells in the first row or the last row that have different colors. If such a pair is found, it means that the grid can potentially be made uniform because there is a possibility to propagate the color changes through the rows.
   - Similarly, it checks if there are any adjacent cells in the first column or the last column that have different colors. If such a pair is found, it means that the grid can potentially be made uniform because there is a possibility to propagate the color changes through the columns.
   
5. **Setting Result:**
   - If no adjacent differing cells are found in either the first/last row or the first/last column, the program sets `ans = 'NO'`, indicating that it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color.
   - Otherwise, it keeps `ans = 'YES'`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result (`'YES'` or `'NO'`) for each test case.

### Analysis:

The logic in the program is sound based on the problem constraints and requirements. Here are some key points to consider:

- **Base Case:** If the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same color, the program correctly assumes that it is possible to make the entire grid the same color, as no further checks are needed.
- **Border Checks:** The checks for adjacent differing cells in the first/last row and first/last column ensure that there is a path for color propagation across the grid. If such paths exist, the grid can be made uniform.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases such as grids with only one row or one column, and grids where all cells are already the same color.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
