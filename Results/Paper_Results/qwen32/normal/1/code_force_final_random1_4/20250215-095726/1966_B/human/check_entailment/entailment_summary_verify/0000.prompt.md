You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = []
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        ans = 'YES'
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
            impossible = True
            for j in range(m - 1):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
            impossible = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with 'W' or 'B'. It determines if it's possible to paint the grid such that all cells are the same color ('W' or 'B') by only changing the colors of the cells on the border of the grid. For each test case, it outputs 'YES' if such a painting is possible, otherwise 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have an `n x m` grid of squares, each colored either 'W' (white) or 'B' (black).
- An operation allows us to select two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them with that color.
- We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using any number of such operations.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid. It checks if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color based on certain conditions.

#### Key Logic:
1. **Initial Check**: If the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid are different colors, the program proceeds to check further conditions.
2. **Horizontal Check**: It checks if all adjacent cells in the first row and last row are the same color.
3. **Vertical Check**: It checks if all adjacent cells in the first column and last column are the same color.
4. **Conclusion**: If the top-left and bottom-right corners are different but the horizontal and vertical checks fail, it concludes that it's impossible to make all squares the same color.

### Potential Issues:
The program seems to rely heavily on the top-left and bottom-right corners and their adjacent cells. However, this approach might not cover all scenarios where making the entire grid the same color is still possible.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following grid:
```
2 2
WB
BW
```
- Top-left corner is 'W', bottom-right corner is 'B'.
- Horizontal check fails because `gr[0][0] != gr[0][1]` and `gr[1][0] != gr[1][1]`.
- Vertical check fails because `gr[0][0] != gr[1][0]` and `gr[0][1] != gr[1][1]`.

According to the program, this would result in "NO". However, it is actually possible to make the entire grid the same color by performing the following operations:
1. Select positions (1, 1) and (2, 2) to color the subrectangle (1, 1) to (2, 2) with 'B'.
2. Select positions (1, 2) and (2, 1) to color the subrectangle (1, 2) to (2, 1) with 'W'.

After these operations, the grid becomes:
```
WW
BB
```
Then, we can select positions (1, 1) and (2, 2) again to color the entire grid with 'W' or 'B'.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to recognize scenarios where making the entire grid the same color is possible despite the top-left and bottom-right corners being different.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly concludes that it's impossible to make all squares the same color in certain cases, such as the counterexample provided above.
