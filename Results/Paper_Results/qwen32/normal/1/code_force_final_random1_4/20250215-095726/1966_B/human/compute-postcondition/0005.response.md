The code appends the result of `input()` to the list `gr`. Since `gr` was initially an empty list, after the execution, `gr` will contain one element which is the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing one element which is the user input.**
