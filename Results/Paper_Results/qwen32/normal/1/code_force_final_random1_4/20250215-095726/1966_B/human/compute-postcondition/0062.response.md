The only variable in the loop head is `j`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop `for j in range(m - 1):`, the loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value, and it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. The loop condition is `j < m - 1`. Since we just completed an iteration with the current `j`, the next value of `j` should be `j + 1`.
2. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `tc`, `ans`, `impossible`) are not part of the loop head and thus remain unchanged.

So, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize this to say that `j` will simply be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 2, `gr` contains `n` elements (each being an input string), the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `tc` has been incremented by `n`, `ans` is `'YES'`. If either the `j`-th character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][j]`) is not equal to the `(j+1)`-th character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][j + 1]`), or the `j`-th character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][j]`) is not equal to the `(j+1)`-th character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][j + 1]`), then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`. `j` is incremented by 1.** 

To be more specific, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 2, `gr` contains `n` elements (each being an input string), the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `tc` has been incremented by `n`, `ans` is `'YES'`. If either the `j`-th character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][j]`) is not equal to the `(j+1)`-th character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][j + 1]`), or the `j`-th character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][j]`) is not equal to the `(j+1)`-th character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][j + 1]`), then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`. `j` is `k + 1`.**

However, since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can simply state that `j` is incremented by 1:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be at least 2, `gr` contains `n` elements (each being an input string), the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `tc` has been incremented by `n`, `ans` is `'YES'`. If either the `j`-th character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][j]`) is not equal to the `(j+1)`-th character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][j + 1]`), or the `j`-th character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][j]`) is not equal to the `(j+1)`-th character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][j + 1]`), then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`. `j` is incremented by 1.**
