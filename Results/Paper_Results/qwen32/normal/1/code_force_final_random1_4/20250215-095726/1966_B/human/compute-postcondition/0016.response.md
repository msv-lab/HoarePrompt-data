Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input collected during each iteration of the loop), `ans` is `'YES'`, `impossible` is `False`. The first element of the first sublist in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`). Additionally, either the element at position `j` in the first sublist (`gr[0][j]`) is not equal to the element at position `j + 1` in the first sublist (`gr[0][j + 1]`), or the element at position `j` in the last sublist (`gr[n - 1][j]`) is not equal to the element at position `j + 1` in the last sublist (`gr[n - 1][j + 1]`).**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `impossible` has been set to `False`. All other conditions and values remain the same.
