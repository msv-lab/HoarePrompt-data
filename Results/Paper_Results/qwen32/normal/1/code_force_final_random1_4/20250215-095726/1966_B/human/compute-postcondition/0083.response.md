To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables based on the given conditions.

### Analysis:
- The loop runs `n - 1` times.
- For each iteration `i` from `0` to `n - 2`, the loop checks if the first characters or the last characters of consecutive strings in `gr` differ.
- If any such difference is found, `impossible` is set to `False`.
- The variable `i` will take values from `0` to `n - 2`.

### Given Information:
- After 3 iterations, `n` is at least 6, and `impossible` is `False`.
- This implies that the loop has run at least 5 times (`n - 1 = 5`), meaning `n` is at least 6.

### Final Iteration:
- The loop will continue until `i` reaches `n - 2`.
- The value of `i` will be `n - 2` after the last iteration.
- The value of `impossible` will be `False` if any of the conditions in the loop body were met during any iteration.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will execute `n - 1` times.
- The final value of `i` will be `n - 2`.
- The value of `impossible` will be `False` if any of the conditions were met during the iterations.
- The values of `t`, `m`, `gr`, `tc`, and `ans` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` contains `n` elements (each being an input string), the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `tc` has been incremented by `n`, `impossible` is `False` if any of the conditions were met during the iterations, `ans` is `'NO'`, `i` is `n - 2`.**

In simple terms, after all iterations, `i` will be `n - 2`, and `impossible` will be `False` if any pair of consecutive strings had differing first or last characters. All other variables remain as they were initially described.
