To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means that the only variable we can adjust is `j`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1
- `n` is greater than or equal to `i` + 1
- `m` is at least 2
- `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (all inputs provided during the loop)
- `tc` is incremented by 1 for each iteration
- `i` is `n` - 1
- `ans` is `'YES'`
- The first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the element at position `m - 1` in the last sublist of `gr`
- `j` is 1
- If `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains unchanged.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, as the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `m - 2`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `j` is 2

All other variables remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i` + 1, `m` is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (all inputs provided during the loop), `tc` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, `i` is `n` - 1, `ans` is `'YES'`, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the element at position `m - 1` in the last sublist of `gr`, `j` is 2. If `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains unchanged.**
