The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This means that the values of `n` and `m` will be updated based on the input provided. The initial state mentioned that `n` is greater than or equal to 0, but this condition is now replaced by the specific values read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `gr`, `tc`, `ans`, and `impossible`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, `tc` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` remains `'YES'` unless the conditions for changing it are met in the loop body, `impossible` remains unchanged**.
