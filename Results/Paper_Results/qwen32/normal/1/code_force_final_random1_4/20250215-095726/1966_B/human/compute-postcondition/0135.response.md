Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with 'W' or 'B'. It determines if it's possible to paint the grid such that all cells are the same color ('W' or 'B') by only changing the colors of the cells on the border of the grid. For each test case, it outputs 'YES' if such a painting is possible, otherwise 'NO'.**
