The code appends a new element to the list `gr`. Initially, `gr` contains one element which is the user input. After executing the code, `gr` will contain two elements: the original user input and the new user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing two elements (the first being the original user input and the second being the new user input), `i` is 1.**
