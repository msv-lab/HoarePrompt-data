Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 500. The grid is represented by n lines, each containing m characters which are either 'W' or 'B'. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    gr = []
    for i in range(n):
        gr.append(input())
    ans = 'YES'
    if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
        impossible = True
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                impossible = False
        if impossible:
            ans = 'NO'
        impossible = True
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                impossible = False
        if impossible:
            ans = 'NO'
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements. If `n` is at least 2 and `m` is at least 2, and `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is `'NO'`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'`. The value of `impossible` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` contains `n` elements (each being an input string), `tc` has been incremented by `n`, `impossible` remains unchanged. If the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), then `ans` is `'NO'` and `i` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is `'YES'` unless `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, in which case `ans` is `'NO'` and `impossible` is set to `True` if there exists at least one pair of consecutive sublists in `gr` with differing first or last elements. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
