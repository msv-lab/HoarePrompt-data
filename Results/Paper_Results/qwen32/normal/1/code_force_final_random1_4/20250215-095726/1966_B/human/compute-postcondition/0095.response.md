The code appends a new input to the list `gr`. Therefore, `gr` now contains two elements: the original input and the new input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `gr` is a list containing two elements (the original input and the new input), `tc` is incremented by 1, `impossible` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**.
