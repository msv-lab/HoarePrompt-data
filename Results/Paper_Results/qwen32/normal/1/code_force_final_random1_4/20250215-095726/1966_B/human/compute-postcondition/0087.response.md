Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` contains `n` elements (each being an input string), `tc` has been incremented by `n`, `impossible` remains unchanged. If the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), then `ans` is `'NO'` and `i` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'`.**
