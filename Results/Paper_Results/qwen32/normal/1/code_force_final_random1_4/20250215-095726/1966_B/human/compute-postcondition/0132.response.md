To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the conditions affecting the variable `ans`.

1. **Variables and Initial Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that `t >= 1`.
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `m` is at least 2.
   - `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is presumably a sublist of length `m`.
   - `i` is set to `n - 1`.
   - `ans` is initially set to `'YES'` unless `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, in which case `ans` is set to `'NO'`.
   - `impossible` is set to `True` if there exists at least one pair of consecutive sublists in `gr` with differing first or last elements; otherwise, it remains `False`.

2. **Condition for `ans`:**
   - If `gr[0][0]` (the first element of the first sublist) is equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]` (the last element of the last sublist), then `ans` is `'YES'`.
   - If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is `'NO'`.

3. **What is printed:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is determined by the comparison between `gr[0][0]` and `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`.

Given this information, the output will be either `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the comparison described above.

Output: **'YES' if gr[0][0] == gr[n - 1][m - 1], otherwise 'NO'**
