Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input collected during each iteration of the loop). `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is `'NO'`. The first element of the first sublist in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`).**

Explanation: The variable `impossible` is set to `True`, which changes the value of `ans` to `'NO'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
