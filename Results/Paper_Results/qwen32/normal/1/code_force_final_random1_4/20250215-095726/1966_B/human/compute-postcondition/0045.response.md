The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, which is the loop variable for the `for` loop iterating over the range of `t`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `tc` by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0
- `m` is an integer
- `gr` is a list containing `n` elements
- If `n` is at least 2 and `m` is at least 2, and `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is `'NO'`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'`.
- The value of `impossible` remains unchanged.

Since `tc` is the loop variable and it gets incremented by 1 in each iteration, we adjust `tc` accordingly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, `tc` is incremented by 1, `ans` remains `'YES'` unless the conditions for changing it are met in the loop body, `impossible` remains unchanged**.

To be more precise, if `tc` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, `tc` is `x + 1` where `x` was the value of `tc` at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` remains `'YES'` unless the conditions for changing it are met in the loop body, `impossible` remains unchanged**.

For simplicity, if we assume `tc` was `0` at the start of the first iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `tc` would be `1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, `tc` is 1, `ans` remains `'YES'` unless the conditions for changing it are met in the loop body, `impossible` remains unchanged**.

However, without knowing the exact value of `tc` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize:

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, `tc` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` remains `'YES'` unless the conditions for changing it are met in the loop body, `impossible` remains unchanged**.
