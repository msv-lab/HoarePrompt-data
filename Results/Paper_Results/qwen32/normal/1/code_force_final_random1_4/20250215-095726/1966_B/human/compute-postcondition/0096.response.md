The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`. Given that `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, this condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `gr` is a list containing two elements (the original input and the new input), `tc` is incremented by 1, `impossible` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`**
