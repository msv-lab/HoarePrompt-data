The code appends the result of `input()` to the list `gr`. Given that `gr` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `gr` will contain one element which is the input provided.

The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `tc`, and `impossible` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input provided, `tc` is incremented by 1, `impossible` remains unchanged**.
