The code appends the input to the list `gr`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` now contains one more element which is the input, `tc` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` remains `'YES'` unless the conditions for changing it are met in the loop body, `impossible` remains unchanged.
