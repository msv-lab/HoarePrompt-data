t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, representing the dimensions of the grid. Following these integers, there are n lines, each containing m characters, either 'W' or 'B', representing the colors of the squares in the grid. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
