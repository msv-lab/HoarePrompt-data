### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations. Let's break down the logic of the program and see if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

#### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Operation Definition**: Select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.
2. **Objective**: Determine if all squares in the grid can be made the same color using any number of operations.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid (`n` and `m`) and the grid itself.
2. **Initial Check**: The program checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid have different colors.
   - If they are different, it proceeds to check if there is a possibility to make the entire grid the same color.
3. **Checking Rows and Columns**:
   - It checks if all elements in the first row are the same and all elements in the last row are the same.
   - Similarly, it checks if all elements in the first column are the same and all elements in the last column are the same.
   - If either the first and last rows or the first and last columns have alternating colors, it concludes that it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color.
4. **Conclusion**: Based on the above checks, the program prints "YES" if it's possible to make the grid uniform in color, otherwise "NO".

#### Flaws in the Logic:
- The program only checks the first and last rows and columns for uniformity. This is insufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform.
- Consider a grid where the first and last rows and columns are uniform, but there are alternating patterns in the middle. The program would incorrectly conclude that the grid can be made uniform.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the following grid:
```
W B W
B W B
W B W
```
Here, the first and last rows and columns are uniform, but it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color using the allowed operations.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases and may give incorrect results for certain grid configurations.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
