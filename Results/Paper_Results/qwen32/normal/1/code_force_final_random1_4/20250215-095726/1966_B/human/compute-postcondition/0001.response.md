To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for tc in range(t):`, where `tc` is the loop variable and `t` is the number of test cases.

Given the state before the loop starts is `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute at least once. Since `t` represents the number of test cases, the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Variable (`tc`)**: This variable is automatically initialized by the `range` function and does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts. It will take values from 0 to `t-1`.

2. **Loop Control Variable (`t`)**: This variable determines how many times the loop will execute. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `t` must be at least 1.

Since `t` is already given as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. However, for clarity and completeness, we can specify that `t` should be at least 1.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts, ensuring the loop can execute, is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4** (no further adjustment needed as `t` is already within the required range)

However, if we want to emphasize the minimum requirement for the loop to execute, we can state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1**
