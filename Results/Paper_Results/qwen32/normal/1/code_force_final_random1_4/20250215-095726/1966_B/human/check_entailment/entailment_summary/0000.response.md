### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking the conditions under which it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color using the specified operations. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initial Check**: The program starts by comparing the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid. If these two corners have different colors, it suggests that there might be a possibility that the entire grid cannot be made uniform. However, this alone is not conclusive.

2. **Horizontal Border Check**: The program then checks the horizontal borders (first row and last row). It verifies whether all adjacent cells in these rows have the same color. If there is at least one pair of adjacent cells with different colors in either the first or the last row, it sets `impossible` to `False`. This means that there is a potential path to change the color of the grid uniformly because the border can be used to propagate the color.

3. **Vertical Border Check**: Similarly, the program checks the vertical borders (first column and last column) for the same condition. If there is at least one pair of adjacent cells with different colors in either the first or the last column, it again sets `impossible` to `False`.

4. **Final Decision**: If, after both the horizontal and vertical border checks, `impossible` remains `True`, it means that all adjacent cells in the borders have the same color, and the corners are also different. In this case, the program concludes that it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color and outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

However, the logic in the program has a flaw. The program only checks the borders for adjacency but does not consider the possibility of having a single color in the entire grid except for a few cells that can be changed through the operations. Specifically, if the corners are different but there exists a way to propagate the color from one corner to the other using the operations, the program incorrectly outputs "NO".

### Example Counter-case:
Consider a grid like this:
```
W W W
W B W
W W W
```
Here, the corners are different, but the entire grid can be made uniform by selecting the subrectangle defined by the top-left and bottom-right corners, which will turn all cells to 'W'.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all scenarios where the grid can be made uniform through the allowed operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
