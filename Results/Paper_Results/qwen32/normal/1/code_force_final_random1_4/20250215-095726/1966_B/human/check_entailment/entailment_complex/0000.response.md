### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine whether it is possible to make all squares in a given grid the same color using the specified operations. The key insight here is that if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid have different colors, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform unless there is a continuous path of the same color connecting these corners along the edges of the grid. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the program:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Grid Reading**: For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid and then reads the grid itself into a list of strings `gr`.
3. **Initial Answer**: The default answer is set to `'YES'`.
4. **Corner Check**: If the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid have different colors, the program checks for the possibility of making the entire grid uniform:
   - **Horizontal Check**: It checks if there is a continuous path of the same color along the top row (`gr[0]`) and the bottom row (`gr[n-1]`). If there is no such path (i.e., there is at least one pair of adjacent cells with different colors in either row), it sets `impossible` to `False`.
   - **Vertical Check**: Similarly, it checks if there is a continuous path of the same color along the left column (`gr[i][0]`) and the right column (`gr[i][m-1]`). If there is no such path, it again sets `impossible` to `False`.
   - If `impossible` remains `True` after both checks, it means there is no way to connect the corners with the same color, and the answer is set to `'NO'`.
5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the answer for each test case.

### Evaluation:

The logic implemented in the program is correct based on the problem statement. The program correctly identifies scenarios where it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color by checking the connectivity of the corners through the edges. If the corners have the same color, it assumes that it is possible to make the entire grid uniform (which is generally true unless there are isolated regions of the opposite color that cannot be connected).

### Conclusion:

Given the provided explanation and the logic in the program, the solution appears to be correct for the given problem constraints and requirements.

**Correctness: True**
