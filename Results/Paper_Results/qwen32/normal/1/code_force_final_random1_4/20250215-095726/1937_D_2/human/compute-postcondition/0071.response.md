To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **String `s`**: It consists of '<' and '>' characters.
2. **Length `n`**: Length of the string `s` and it must be greater than 0.
3. **List `A`**: Contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
4. **List `idx_A`**: Contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
5. **List `B`**: Contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
6. **List `idx_B`**: Contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.
7. **Variable `l`**: Less than `r`.
8. **Variable `r`**: Number of '<' characters in `s`.
9. **Index `i`**: At this index, `s[i]` is '>'.
10. **Variable `a`**: Value from `A[l]`.
11. **Variable `x`**: Calculated as `r - (l + 2)`.
12. **Variable `b`**: Calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the expression inside the `print` statement:

- `a * 2`: This is twice the value of `a`, which is `A[l]`.
- `b * 2`: This is twice the value of `b`, which is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
- `i + 1`: This is the index `i` plus one.

Putting it all together, the expression being printed is:
\[ \text{Output} = a \times 2 + b \times 2 + i + 1 \]

Where:
- `a` is the value at index `l` of list `A`.
- `b` is calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
- `i` is the current index where `s[i]` is '>'.

Therefore, the final output will be:
Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where a is A[l], b is (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1), and i is the current index where s[i] is '>')**
