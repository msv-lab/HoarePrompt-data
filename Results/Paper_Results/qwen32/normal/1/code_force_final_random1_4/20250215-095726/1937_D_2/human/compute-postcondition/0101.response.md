To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the expressions involved in the `print` statement:

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `s`: A string consisting of '<' and '>'.
   - `n`: Length of the string `s` (greater than 0).
   - `A`: List of computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
   - `idx_A`: List of indices where '>' appears in `s`.
   - `B`: List of computed values based on the positions of '<' in `s`.
   - `idx_B`: List of indices where '<' appears in `s`.
   - `l`: An integer greater than 0.
   - `r`: Number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1.
   - `i`: Current index in the string `s` where `s[i]` is not '>'.
   - `a`: Computed as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
   - `b`: Updated based on the condition `r - l >= 0`:
     - If `r - l >= 0`, then `b = B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
     - Otherwise, `b = B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.

2. **Expression to be printed:**
   - `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`

Let's analyze the expression step-by-step:

- **Value of `a`:**
  - `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
  - `A[l - 1]` is a precomputed value based on the position of the `l-1`th '>' in `s`.
  - `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` adjusts this value based on the distance from the `l-1`th '>' to the current index `i`.

- **Value of `b`:**
  - `b` is adjusted based on the presence of '<' characters.
  - If `r - l >= 0`, it involves multiple terms adjusting `B[r]` based on the positions of '<' characters and the current index `i`.
  - If `r - l < 0`, it simplifies to `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.

- **Final Expression:**
  - The final expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.

Given the complexity and the dependency on specific values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, and `i`, we cannot compute an exact numerical value without knowing the specific values of these variables. However, we can describe the expression precisely based on the given information.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement can be described as follows:

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where a = A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, b is updated based on the condition r - l >= 0, and i is the current index in the string s where s[i] is not '>')**
