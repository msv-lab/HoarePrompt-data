The given code calculates a new value for `x` based on the current state of the lists `B` and `idx_B`, and the index `i`. Here's the breakdown:

- `x` is assigned the value of the last element of `B` plus the product of the difference between the last element of `idx_B` and `i`, and the length of `idx_B`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
- `B` is an empty list.
- `idx_B` is not an empty list.
- `i` is `n - 1 - j`, and the character at position `i` in `s` is '<'.

Since `B` is an empty list, `len(B)` is 0. Therefore, `B[len(B) - 1]` would normally cause an error because you cannot access an element at index -1 in an empty list. However, since the problem statement implicitly assumes that the code will run without errors, we can infer that there might be some context or additional logic not shown here that ensures `B` has at least one element when this line is reached.

Assuming `B` has at least one element, let's denote the last element of `B` as `B_last` and the last element of `idx_B` as `idx_B_last`. The value of `x` will be calculated as:

\[ x = B_{\text{last}} + (\text{idx\_B}_{\text{last}} - i) \times \text{len}(\text{idx\_B}) \]

Since `i` is `n - 1 - j` and the character at position `i` in `s` is '<', these conditions remain unchanged.

Thus, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` is a list with at least one element; `idx_B` is not an empty list; `i` is `n - 1 - j`, and the character at position `i` in `s` is '<'; `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len(idx_B)`**.
