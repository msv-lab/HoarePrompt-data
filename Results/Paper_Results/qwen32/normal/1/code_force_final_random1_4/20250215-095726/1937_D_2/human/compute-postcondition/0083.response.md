Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement.

### Given Information:
- `s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
- `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
- `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`.
- `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
- At the current index `i`, `s[i]` is '>'.
- `l` is not less than `r`.
- `r` is greater than 0.
- If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. Otherwise, `b` remains `A[l - 1]`.
- `b` is now `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `a`:**
   - `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
   - `B[r - 1]` is the last element of the list `B`.
   - `idx_B[r - 1]` is the last index where '<' appears in `s`.
   - `i` is the current index where `s[i]` is '>'.
   - Therefore, `a` is the last value in `B` plus the difference between the last index of '<' and the current index `i`, multiplied by the number of '<' characters `r`.

2. **Variable `b`:**
   - `b` is initially determined based on the condition `l - r > 0`.
   - Since `l` is 0 and `r` is greater than 0, `l - r` is negative, so the condition `l - r > 0` is false.
   - Thus, `b` is simply `A[l - 1]`, which is `A[-1]` (the last element of `A`).
   - `b` is then adjusted by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
   - `idx_A[l - 1]` is the last index where '>' appears in `s`.
   - Therefore, `b` is the last value in `A` plus the difference between the current index `i` and the last index of '>', multiplied by the number of '<' characters `r`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement outputs `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`, followed by a space.
   - `a * 2` is twice the value of `a`.
   - `b * 2` is twice the value of `b`.
   - `(n - i)` is the remaining length of the string `s` from the current index `i` to the end.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is the sum of twice the value of `a`, twice the value of `b`, and the remaining length of the string `s` from the current index `i` to the end.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) (where a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b = A[-1] + (i - idx_A[-1]) * r, n is the length of s, and i is the current index where s[i] is '>')**
