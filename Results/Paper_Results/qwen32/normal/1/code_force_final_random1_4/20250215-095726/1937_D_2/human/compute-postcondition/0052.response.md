To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
```

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
- `B` contains either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` followed by 0 if `idx_B` was not empty, or includes the previously existing elements plus the new element `x` where `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len_idx_B` if `idx_B` was not empty.
- `idx_B` contains all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i` if `s[i]` is '<'.
- `i` is `n - 1 - j`.
- `j` is `j + 1`.

The line of code calculates a new value for `x` based on the last element of `B`, the last element of `idx_B`, the current value of `i`, and the length of `idx_B`. This new value of `x` will be used to potentially update `B` and `idx_B` in subsequent steps, but the given code only computes `x`.

Let's break down the computation:
- `B[len(B) - 1]`: This is the last element of list `B`.
- `idx_B[len(B) - 1]`: This is the last element of list `idx_B`.
- `i`: This is the current index, calculated as `n - 1 - j`.
- `len(idx_B)`: This is the number of elements in `idx_B`.

Thus, `x` is calculated as:
\[ x = \text{B\_last} + (\text{idx\_B\_last} - i) \times \text{len\_idx\_B} \]

After computing `x`, the state of `B` and `idx_B` remains unchanged unless they are updated in subsequent lines of code, which are not provided here.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` contains either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` followed by 0 if `idx_B` was not empty, or includes the previously existing elements plus the new element `x` where `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len_idx_B` if `idx_B` was not empty, `idx_B` contains all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i` if `s[i]` is '<', `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `j` is `j + 1`, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`**.
