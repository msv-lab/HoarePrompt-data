Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 2`; `r` is decreased by 1; `a` is `B[r]`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`. Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.**
