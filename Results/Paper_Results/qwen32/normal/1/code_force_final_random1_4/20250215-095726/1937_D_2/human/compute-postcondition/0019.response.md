Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i_prev + 1`. If `s[i] == '>'`, `idx_A` has a new element `i` appended to it; if `len(idx_A)` was 0 before, `A` has a new element `0` appended to it; otherwise, `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A) - 1`, and `A` has a new element `x` appended to it.**
