To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```
x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
```

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`.

The code snippet introduces new variables `A` and `idx_A`, which are not defined in the initial state. For the purpose of this exercise, we will assume that these variables are already defined and contain specific values or structures.

Let's denote:
- `A[len(A) - 1]` as the last element of list `A`.
- `idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]` as the last element of list `idx_A`.

Based on the code snippet, the variable `x` is calculated using the formula provided. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, and their respective lengths are crucial for determining the exact value of `x`. Since these are not specified, we will express `x` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**.

This output state includes all the information from the initial state that remains unchanged, along with the newly calculated value of `x` expressed in terms of the existing variables.
