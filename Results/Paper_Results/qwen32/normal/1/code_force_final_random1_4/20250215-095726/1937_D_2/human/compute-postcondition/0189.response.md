To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the components involved:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `s`: A string consisting of '<' and '>'.
   - `n`: Length of the string `s` (greater than 0).
   - `A`: Contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
   - `idx_A`: Contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
   - `B`: Contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
   - `idx_B`: Contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.
   - `i`: Defined as `i_end + 2`.
   - `r`: Decreased by 1.
   - `a`: Calculated as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
   - `b`: Calculated differently based on the condition `r - l >= 0`.

2. **Expression to be printed:**
   - `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`

Given the complexity of the expressions and the lack of specific values for `l`, `i_end`, `r`, `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B`, we cannot compute the exact numerical values. However, we can describe the expression in terms of these variables.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Calculate `a`:**
   - `a = A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`
     - `A[l - 1]`: The value at index `l - 1` in the list `A`.
     - `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`: The difference between `i` and the index of the last '>' multiplied by `l`.

2. **Calculate `b`:**
   - If `r - l >= 0`:
     - `b = ((B[r] - B[r - l]) - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`
   - Else:
     - `b = B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`
     - `B[r]`: The value at index `r` in the list `B`.
     - `(idx_B[r] - i) * l`: The difference between the index of the `<` at position `r` and `i` multiplied by `l`.

3. **Final Expression:**
   - `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`

### Final Output Description:

The final expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` combines the computed values of `a` and `b` with the value of `i`. Given the definitions and the conditions, the output will be a numerical value derived from these variables.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where a is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, b is ((B[r] - B[r - l]) - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l if r - l >= 0 else B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l, i is i_end + 2, and r is decreased by 1)**
