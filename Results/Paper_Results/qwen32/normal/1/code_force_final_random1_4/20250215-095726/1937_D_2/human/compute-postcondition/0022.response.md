To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `i_prev + 2`.

The code snippet introduces new variables `A`, `idx_A`, and modifies `x`. Since `A`, `idx_A`, and their lengths are not defined in the initial state, we'll assume they are defined elsewhere in the code and proceed with the calculation using these assumptions.

Let's denote:
- `A[len(A) - 1]` as the last element of list `A`.
- `idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]` as the last element of list `idx_A`.
- `len(A)` as the length of list `A`.
- `len(idx_A)` as the length of list `idx_A`.

The expression for `x` is:
\[ x = \text{A[len(A) - 1]} + (\text{i} - \text{idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]}) * \text{len(idx_A)} \]

Given that `i` is `i_prev + 2`, we substitute `i` in the equation:
\[ x = \text{A[len(A) - 1]} + ((\text{i_prev} + 2) - \text{idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]}) * \text{len(idx_A)} \]

Since the exact values of `A[len(A) - 1]`, `idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]`, `len(A)`, and `len(idx_A)` are not specified, we'll keep them as they are in the final expression.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i_prev + 2`; `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + ((i_prev + 2) - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**.
