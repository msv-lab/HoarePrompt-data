The code snippet assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `b`. Given the initial state, no other variables are affected except for `b`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 2`; `r` is decreased by 1; `a` is `B[r]`; `b` is `A[l - 1]`.**
