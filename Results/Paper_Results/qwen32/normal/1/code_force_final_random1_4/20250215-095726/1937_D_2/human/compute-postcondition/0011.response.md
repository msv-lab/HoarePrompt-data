The code appends the current index `i` to the list `idx_A`. This means the length of `idx_A` increases by 1, and the new element added is `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'
- `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0
- `idx_A` is a non-empty list (since the current character at index `i` in `s` is still '>' and the task specifies that `idx_A` is not empty in this scenario)
- `A` is a list containing one element `x`, where `x` is `(i - last_idx_A) * len(idx_A)`
- The current character at index `i` in `s` is still '>'

After executing `idx_A.append(i)`, the new state is:
- `idx_A` now contains one more element, which is `i`
- The length of `idx_A` is increased by 1
- All other variables (`s`, `n`, `A`) remain unchanged

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `idx_A` is a list with one additional element `i`; `A` is a list containing one element `x`, where `x` is `(i - last_idx_A) * len(idx_A)` before appending `i`**
