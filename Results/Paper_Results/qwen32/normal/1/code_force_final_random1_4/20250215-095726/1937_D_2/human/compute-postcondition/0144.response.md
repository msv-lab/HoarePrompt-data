Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 1`; `r` is decreased by 1; `a` is assigned the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`; `b` is assigned the value of `b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from its previous value. All other variables retain their previously assigned values or conditions.
