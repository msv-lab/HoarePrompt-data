Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` is a list that may contain either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` if `idx_B` was not empty, `idx_B` is either an empty list or contains indices, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, and the character at position `i` in `s` is '<'. If `idx_B` was initially empty, `B` becomes [0]. Otherwise, `B` includes a new element `x` which is calculated as `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len(idx_B)`**
