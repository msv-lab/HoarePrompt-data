### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. The logic involves maintaining two lists, `A` and `B`, which store cumulative values based on the positions of '>' and '<' respectively. These lists help in efficiently computing the total time taken for the pinball to exit the grid from any given starting position.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization and List Construction (`A` and `idx_A`)**:
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and constructs the list `A` which stores cumulative values based on the positions of '>' characters. The list `idx_A` keeps track of the indices where '>' appears.
   
2. **Initialization and List Construction (`B` and `idx_B`)**:
   - Similarly, the program iterates through the string `s` in reverse and constructs the list `B` which stores cumulative values based on the positions of '<' characters. The list `idx_B` keeps track of the indices where '<' appears.

3. **Calculation of Time for Each Starting Position**:
   - For each starting position `i`, the program checks whether the character at `s[i]` is '>' or '<'.
   - Depending on the character, it uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid. The calculations involve considering the number of '>' and '<' characters encountered and their respective positions.
   - The results are printed in a single line for each test case.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Cumulative Values Calculation**:
  - The cumulative values in `A` and `B` are correctly calculated based on the positions of '>' and '<'. This ensures that the program can efficiently compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid from any starting position.
  
- **Handling Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases such as when there are no '>' or '<' characters in the string, or when the pinball starts at the boundary of the grid.
  
- **Complexity Considerations**:
  - The program runs in linear time relative to the length of the string `s` for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the logic and the implementation, it appears that the program correctly computes the required times for each starting position. Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified.

**Correctness: True**
