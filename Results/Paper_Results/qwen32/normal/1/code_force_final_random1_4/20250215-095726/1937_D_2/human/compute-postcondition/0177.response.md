Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 2`. If `r` equals 0, no additional changes are made to `a` or `b`. Otherwise, `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. If `l - r` is less than or equal to 0, `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**
