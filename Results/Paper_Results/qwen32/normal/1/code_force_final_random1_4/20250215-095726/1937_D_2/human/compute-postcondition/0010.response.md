Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0. If `idx_A` was initially empty, then `A` is now a list containing one element [0]. Otherwise, `A` is a list containing one element `x`, where `x` is `(i - last_idx_A) * len(idx_A)`, and `idx_A` is a non-empty list. The current character at index `i` in `s` is still '>'.**
