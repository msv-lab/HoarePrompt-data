Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`. If `s[i]` is '>', then `l` is incremented by 1. Depending on the relationship between `l` and `r`, `a` and `b` are updated as follows: if `l < r`, `a` is `A[l]` and `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`; if `l >= r`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`; if `l - r > 0`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`; otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `s[i]` is not '>', then `r` is decremented by 1. Depending on the relationship between `l` and `r`, `a` and `b` are updated as follows: if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `a` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` and `b` is updated to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l >= 0`, otherwise `b` is updated to `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`; if `l` is greater than `r`, `a` is `B[r]` if `r` is 0, otherwise `a` remains unchanged; `b` is updated to its previous value plus `(i - idx_A[-1]) * (r + 1)` if `r` is not 0.**
