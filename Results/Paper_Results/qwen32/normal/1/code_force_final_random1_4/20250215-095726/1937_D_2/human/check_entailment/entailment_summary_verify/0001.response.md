### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a grid of length `n` with cells containing either '<' or '>'.
- A pinball placed on a cell moves left if the cell contains '<' and right if it contains '>'.
- After moving, the direction of the cell is inverted.
- The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.
- We need to determine how many seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of a main loop that processes multiple test cases and a function `func_1` that computes the time for each pinball to leave the grid.

##### Main Loop:
- Reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, reads the grid length `n` and the grid string `s`.
- Calls `func_1(s)` to compute and print the results for that test case.

##### Function `func_1`:
- **Processing Cells with `>`**:
  - Iterates through the grid from left to right.
  - For each cell with `>`, calculates the cumulative movement based on previous cells with `>`.
  - Stores these values in `A` and their indices in `idx_A`.
  
- **Processing Cells with `<`**:
  - Iterates through the grid from right to left.
  - For each cell with `<`, calculates the cumulative movement based on previous cells with `<`.
  - Stores these values in `B` and their indices in `idx_B`.
  
- **Calculating Results**:
  - Initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to manage the indices in `A` and `B`.
  - For each cell, depending on whether it contains `>` or `<`, it calculates the total time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using the precomputed values in `A` and `B`.
  - Prints the result for each cell.

#### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` processes a string `s` and calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. It uses cumulative movements stored in `A` and `B` to determine these times.

#### Issues and Challenges:
1. **Complexity**: The logic inside `func_1` is intricate and involves multiple nested conditions and calculations, which increases the likelihood of errors.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program needs to handle edge cases such as grids with only `>` or only `<`, and very large grids efficiently.
3. **Correctness of Calculations**: The calculations for cumulative movements and final times seem correct based
