The given code snippet assigns the value of `B[r]` to the variable `b`. None of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `i`, `r`, `a`) are modified by this line of code.

Since `r` is decreased by 1 before the assignment, the value of `b` will be the element at the index `r` in the list `B`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 2`; `r` is decreased by 1; `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`; `b` is `B[r]`.**
