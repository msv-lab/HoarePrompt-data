Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 1`. If `s[i] == '>'`, then the following updates occur: if `l < r`, `a` is set to `A[l]` and `x` is `r - (l + 2)`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is updated to `(B[r - 1] - B[x]) - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. Otherwise, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `l >= r`, then if `r` is not 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. If `l - r > 0`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged; `l` is incremented by 1. If `s[i] != '>'`, then `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is 0, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, if `l <= r`, `a` is assigned the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` and `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `l > r`, `a` is set to `B[r]` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.**
