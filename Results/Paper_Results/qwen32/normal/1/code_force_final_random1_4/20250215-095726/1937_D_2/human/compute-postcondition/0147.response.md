To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **String `s`**: It consists of '<' and '>' characters.
2. **Length `n`**: It is the length of the string `s` and is greater than 0.
3. **List `A`**: Contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
4. **List `idx_A`**: Contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
5. **List `B`**: Contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
6. **List `idx_B`**: Contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.
7. **Variable `i`**: It is set to `i_end + 1`.
8. **Variable `r`**: It is decreased by 1.
9. **Variable `a`**: It is assigned the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
10. **Variable `b`**: It is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.

Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `s`, `l`, `i_end`, `r`, `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B`, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `a` and `b`. However, we can express the output in terms of these variables.

Let's derive the expression inside the `print` statement:

- `a * 2`: This is twice the value of `a`.
- `b * 2`: This is twice the value of `b`.
- `i + 1`: This is `i` incremented by 1.

Combining these, the `print` statement outputs:
\[ \text{Output: } a \times 2 + b \times 2 + i + 1 \]

Where:
- `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- `b` is `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.

Thus, the final output can be described as:
Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where a = A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l and b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l)**
