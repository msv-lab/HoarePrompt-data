Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i_prev + 2`. If `len(idx_A)` is 0, `A` contains an additional element `0`. Otherwise, `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + ((i_prev + 2) - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` and `A` now includes `x` as its last element.**
