To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the components and understand how they are derived from the initial state:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `s`: A string consisting of '<' and '>'.
- `n`: Length of the string `s`, which is greater than 0.
- `A`: Contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A`: Contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
- `B`: Contains values computed based on the positions of '<' in `s`.
- `idx_B`: Contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.
- `i`: Defined as `i_end + 1`.
- `a`: Calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
- `b`: If `l - r > 0`, it is calculated as `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. Otherwise, it remains the same expression.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

#### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `a`**:
   - `a` is defined as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
   - `B[r - 1]` refers to the value in list `B` at index `r - 1`.
   - `idx_B[r - 1]` refers to the index of the `r-th` occurrence of '>' in the string `s`.
   - `i` is `i_end + 1`.
   - `r` is an index related to the number of '>' characters considered.

2. **Calculate `b`**:
   - If `l - r > 0`, `b` is calculated as `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
   - Otherwise, `b` is the same expression.
   - `A[l - 1]` and `A[l - r - 1]` refer to values in list `A` at indices `l - 1` and `l - r - 1` respectively.
   - `idx_A[l - 1]` and `idx_A[l - r - 1]` refer to indices of the `l-th` and `(l - r)-th` occurrences of '>' in the string `s`.

3. **Final Expression**:
   - The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` combines the computed values of `a` and `b` with the length of the string `s` minus `i`.

### Output Description:
Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `s`, `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, `i`, `r`, and `l`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables:

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) (where a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r if l - r > 0, and n is the length of the string s)**
