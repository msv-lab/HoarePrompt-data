The code snippet modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from its current value.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
- `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
- `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.
- `i` is `i_end + 2`.
- `r` is decreased by 1.
- `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l]`.

The new value of `b` is calculated as:
\[ b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) \]

Therefore, the updated value of `b` is:
\[ b = (B[r] - B[r - l]) - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) \]

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 2`; `r` is decreased by 1; `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`; `b` is `(B[r] - B[r - l]) - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`**.
