To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(i + 1, end=' ')`, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
- `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
- `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1.
- At the current index `i`, `s[i]` is not '>'.
- `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
- `l` is currently 0.

From the initial state, we know that `i` is an index in the string `s` where `s[i]` is not '>'. Since `l` is 0 and `l` is less than or equal to `r`, it implies that there is at least one '<' character in the string `s`.

However, the exact value of `i` is not explicitly provided. We only know that `s[i]` is not '>', meaning `s[i]` must be '<'. Given this information, `i` could be any index in the string `s` where the character is '<'.

The print statement `print(i + 1, end=' ')` will print the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is the index of a '<' character in the string `s`, `i + 1` will be the position of this '<' character in the string, counting from 1 instead of 0 (since Python uses 0-based indexing).

Given that the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `i`. Therefore, the output will be `i + 1`, where `i` is the index of a '<' character in the string `s`.

Output: **i + 1 (where i is the index of a '<' character in the string s)**
