The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `idx_A`. This affects only the list `idx_A`, and no other variables are changed directly by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `idx_A` will now include the new element `i`. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `i_prev`, `A`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; `idx_A` has a new element `i` appended to it; If `len(idx_A)` was 0 before, `A` has a new element `0` appended to it. Otherwise, `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A) - 1`, and `A` has a new element `x` appended to it.**
