The code modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from its current value.

Given the initial state, `b` is initially `B[r - 1] - B[x]`. After the execution of the line `b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`, the new value of `b` becomes:

\[ b = (B[r - 1] - B[x]) - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) \]

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 1`; `a` is `A[l]`; `x` is `r - (l + 2)`; `b` is `(B[r - 1] - B[x]) - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`**.
