The code snippet calculates the value of `a` using the formula `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. This calculation does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, or `i_end`. The only variable that gets a new value is `a`.

Given the initial state, the value of `a` will be determined by the values of `B[r - 1]`, `idx_B[r - 1]`, `i`, and `r`. Since the exact values of these variables are not specified, we express `a` in terms of them.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 1`; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.**
