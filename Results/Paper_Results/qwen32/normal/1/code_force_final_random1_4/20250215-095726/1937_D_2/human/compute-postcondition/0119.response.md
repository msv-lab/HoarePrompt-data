The code snippet assigns the value of `A[l]` to the variable `a`. This means that `a` now holds the value stored at index `l` in the list `A`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state, the only change is the introduction of the variable `a` with its new value.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 1`; `a` is `A[l]`.**
