The code appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. No other variables are modified by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` is a list with at least one element, and now includes the new element `x`; `idx_B` is not an empty list; `i` is `n - 1 - j`, and the character at position `i` in `s` is '<'; `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len(idx_B)`**.
