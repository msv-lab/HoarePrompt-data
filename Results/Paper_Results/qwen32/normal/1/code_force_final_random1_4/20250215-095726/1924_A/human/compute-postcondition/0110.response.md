The given code snippet appends a specific number of 'a' characters to the string `ans`. Specifically, it appends `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters to `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5.
- `n` and `k` remain integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.
- `m` remains an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000.
- `s` remains the same non-empty string read from the input.
- `cnt` is less than `n`.
- `ans` is a string containing the last character from each sequence of k unique characters plus the value of `tmp`.
- `tmp` is 'a' + (k - 1) if the k-th bit of `cur` is not set, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string.
- `i` is `k`.
- `cur` is 0 unless the last sequence did not reach `k` unique characters.

After executing the line `ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`, the string `ans` will have `(n - cnt - 1)` additional 'a' characters appended to it. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` and `k` remain integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `m` remains an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` remains the same non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string containing the last character from each sequence of k unique characters plus the value of `tmp` plus `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters; `tmp` is 'a' + (k - 1) if the k-th bit of `cur` is not set, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string; `i` is `k`; `cur` is 0 unless the last sequence did not reach `k` unique characters.**
