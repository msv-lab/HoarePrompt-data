The code snippet updates the value of `cur_ss` by calculating the ordinal difference between the new value of `ss` and the character 'a'. Given that `ss` is initially `s[2]`, `cur_ss` will now hold the value `ord(s[2]) - ord('a')`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5.
- `n` and `k` remain integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.
- `m` remains an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000.
- `s` remains a non-empty string read from the input.
- `cnt` remains either 0 or 1.
- `ans` remains either '' or `s[1]`.
- `tmp` remains an empty string.
- `i` remains 1.
- `cur_ss` is now `ord(s[2]) - ord('a')`.
- `ss` remains `s[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is either '' or `s[1]`, `tmp` is an empty string, `i` is 1, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[2]) - ord('a')`, `ss` is `s[2]`.**
