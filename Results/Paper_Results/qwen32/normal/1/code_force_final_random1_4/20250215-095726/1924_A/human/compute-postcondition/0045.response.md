The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `tmp`. Specifically, `tmp` is updated to the character corresponding to the ASCII value of 'a' plus the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 1, `tmp` will be assigned the character 'b'.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` characters were seen in any order within the string `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0 if the last sequence of characters completed a set of `k` characters, otherwise it reflects the incomplete set, `ans` is the last character `ss` that completed a set of `k` characters, `tmp` is 'b', `i` is 1, and the `break` statement was encountered.**
