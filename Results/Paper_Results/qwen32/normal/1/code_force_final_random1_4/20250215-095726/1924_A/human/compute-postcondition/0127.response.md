The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the value of `ss` to the `ans` string. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the value of `ss`, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur` is 0, and `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**
