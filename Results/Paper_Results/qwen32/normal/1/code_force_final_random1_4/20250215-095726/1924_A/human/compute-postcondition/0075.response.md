The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` modifies the value of `cur` by adding to it the result of `1` left-shifted by `cur_ss` bits. Given the initial state, `cur_ss` is calculated as `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')`. Since `s` is a non-empty string and `s[1]` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` will be an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive), depending on the character.

The operation `1 << cur_ss` effectively sets the bit at position `cur_ss` in the binary representation of `1` to `1`, and all other bits to `0`. Adding this to `cur` sets the corresponding bit in `cur` to `1`.

Since `cur` was not previously defined in the initial state, we assume it starts at `0`. After the operation, `cur` will have its bit at position `cur_ss` set to `1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is '', `tmp` is an empty string, `i` is 1, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')`, `ss` is `s[1]`, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`**.
