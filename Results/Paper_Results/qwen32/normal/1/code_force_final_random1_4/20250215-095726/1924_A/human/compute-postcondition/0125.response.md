Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, and `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
