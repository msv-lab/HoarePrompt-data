The given code snippet calculates the 0-based index of the character `ss` within the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. This is done by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of `ss`.

Given that `ss` is a character from the string `s`, which consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cur_ss` will be an integer between 0 and `k-1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length `m` (where `m` >= 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1` representing the 0-based index of the new `ss` in the alphabet, calculated as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**
