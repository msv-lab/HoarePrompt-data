The code snippet initializes a new variable `ans` and assigns it an empty string. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the addition of the `ans` variable.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string.**
