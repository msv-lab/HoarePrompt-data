The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. This means the values of `n`, `k`, and `m` will be updated based on the input provided. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `ans`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` characters were seen in any order within the string `s`, `cur` is 0 if the last sequence of characters completed a set of `k` characters, otherwise it reflects the incomplete set, `ans` is the last character(s) that completed a set of `k` characters. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the state remains as described. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is the last character(s) that completed a set of `k` characters followed by 'a' * (n - cnt - 1), and `tmp` is an empty string, `i` is `i + 1`.**
In simpler terms: The values of `n`, `k`, and `m` are updated based on the input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
