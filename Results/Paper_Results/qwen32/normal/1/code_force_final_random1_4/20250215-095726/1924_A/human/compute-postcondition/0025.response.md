To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variable `ss` since it is the only variable in the loop head. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur_ss`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`) are either constants or are updated within the loop body, so they do not need to be adjusted here.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26
- `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000
- `s` is a new string of length `m` (where `m` >= 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets
- `ss` is the next character in the string `s`
- `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1` representing the 0-based index of the new `ss` in the alphabet, calculated as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`
- If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`
- If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `ss`, and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string
- If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is set to `ss`, with `cur` being reset to 0

At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` was the current character being processed in the string `s`. For the next iteration, `ss` should be the next character in the string `s`.

Since `s` is a string of length `m`, and assuming we are currently processing the `i-th` character (0-indexed), the next character to process would be the `(i+1)-th` character, unless `i+1` equals `m`, in which case the loop would terminate.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `ss` should be the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length `m` (where `m` >= 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1` representing the 0-based index of the new `ss` in the alphabet, calculated as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**
