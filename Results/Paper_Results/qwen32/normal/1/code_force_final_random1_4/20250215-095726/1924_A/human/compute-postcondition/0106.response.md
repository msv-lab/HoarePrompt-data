Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` and `k` remain integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `m` remains an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` remains the same non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string containing the last character from each sequence of `k` unique characters; `i` is 3; `cur` is 0 unless the last sequence did not reach `k` unique characters; `tmp` is 'd'; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
