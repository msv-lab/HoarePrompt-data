Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. The integer `n` represents the number of available letters in the alphabet (up to 26), `k` specifies the number of distinct letters used in the string `s`, and `m` is the length of the string `s`. The string `s` consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
