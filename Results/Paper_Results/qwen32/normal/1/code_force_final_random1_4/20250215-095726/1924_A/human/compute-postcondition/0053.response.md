The given code snippet is `ans += tmp`. This line concatenates the value of `tmp` to the value of `ans`. Since `tmp` is described as an empty string, adding it to `ans` does not change the value of `ans`.

Here's the updated state of the variables after executing the code:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5.
- `n` and `k` remain integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.
- `m` remains an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000.
- `s` remains a new string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
- `cnt` remains the number of times all k characters were seen in any order within the string s, and cnt is less than n.
- `cur` remains 0 if the last sequence of characters completed a set of k characters, otherwise it reflects the incomplete set.
- `ans` remains the last character ss that completed a set of k characters, since `tmp` is an empty string and adding it to `ans` does not change its value.
- `tmp` remains an empty string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times all k characters were seen in any order within the string s and cnt is less than n, `cur` is 0 if the last sequence of characters completed a set of k characters, otherwise it reflects the incomplete set, `ans` is the last character ss that completed a set of k characters, `tmp` is an empty string.**
