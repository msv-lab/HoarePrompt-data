Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5. `n` and `k` remain integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26. `m` remains an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000. `s` remains the same non-empty string read from the input. `cnt` is the total number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is a string containing the last character from each sequence of `k` unique characters. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string containing the last character from each sequence of `k` unique characters plus the value of `tmp` plus `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters. `tmp` is 'a' + (k - 1) if the k-th bit of `cur` is not set, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string. `i` is `k` if `cnt` is less than `n`, otherwise `i` remains 1. `cur` is 0 unless the last sequence did not reach `k` unique characters.**
