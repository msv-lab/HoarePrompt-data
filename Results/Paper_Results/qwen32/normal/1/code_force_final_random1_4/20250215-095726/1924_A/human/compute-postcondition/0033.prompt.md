Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length m (where m >= 1) consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and k-1 representing the 0-based index of `ss` in the alphabet. If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `ss`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `ans` remains an empty string, and `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length `m` (where `m` >= 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1` representing the 0-based index of the new `ss` in the alphabet, calculated as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `ss`, and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is set to `ss`, with `cur` being reset to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length `m` (where `m` >= 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and `k-1` representing the 0-based index of the new `ss` in the alphabet, calculated as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `cur` is reset to 0, and `ans` is a string containing the character `ss`. Otherwise, `cur` and `ans` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
