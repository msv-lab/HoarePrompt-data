Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the value of `ss`, and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string.**
