The given code snippet sets `cur` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged. Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), `cur` is 0, `ans` is unchanged, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
