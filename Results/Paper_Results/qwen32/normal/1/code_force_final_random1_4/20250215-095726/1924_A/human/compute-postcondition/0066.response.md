The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` updates the value of `cur` by performing a bitwise OR operation with `1` shifted left by `cur_ss` positions. Given that `cur_ss` is initially `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, which represents the zero-based index of the first character in the string `s` within the alphabet, the new value of `cur` will have the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` set to 1.

Since no other variables are modified by this line of code, their values remain unchanged. Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`, `ans` is '', `tmp` is an empty string, `i` is 1, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. Additionally, the bitwise AND operation between `cur` and `1 << cur_ss` equals `1 << cur_ss`.**
