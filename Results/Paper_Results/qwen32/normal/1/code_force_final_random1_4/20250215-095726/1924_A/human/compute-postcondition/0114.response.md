The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The initial state specifies that these variables (`n`, `k`, and `m`) are read from the input, and their values are within certain ranges. However, the code snippet overwrites the existing values of `n`, `k`, and `m` with new values read from the input.

Since the initial state does not specify the current values of `n`, `k`, and `m`, we can only describe the output state in terms of the new values read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are new integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a new integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` remains the same non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is the total number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively, `ans` is a string based on the conditions involving `cnt`, `tmp`, and `n`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
