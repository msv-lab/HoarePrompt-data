Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    ans = ''
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
            ans += ss
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                break
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is the number of times all `k` characters were seen in any order within the string `s`, `cur` is 0 if the last sequence of characters completed a set of `k` characters, otherwise it reflects the incomplete set, `ans` is the last character(s) that completed a set of `k` characters. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the state remains as described. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is the last character(s) that completed a set of `k` characters followed by 'a' * (n - cnt - 1), and `tmp` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5. `n` and `k` remain integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26. `m` remains an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000. `s` remains the same non-empty string read from the input. `cnt` is the total number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is a string containing the last character from each sequence of `k` unique characters. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string containing the last character from each sequence of `k` unique characters plus the value of `tmp` plus `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters. `tmp` is 'a' + (k - 1) if the k-th bit of `cur` is not set, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string. `i` is `k` if `cnt` is less than `n`, otherwise `i` remains 1. `cur` is 0 unless the last sequence did not reach `k` unique characters.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, n and k are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, m is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, s is a non-empty string, i is either i + len(s) or k-1 depending on whether cnt is greater than or equal to n, cur is the bitwise representation of the unique characters seen in the last incomplete set (or 0 if complete), cnt is the number of times k unique characters were seen consecutively, and if cnt is greater than or equal to n, ans is the last character added when cur reached (1 << k) - 1; otherwise, ans is the concatenation of its previous value and 'a' * (n - cnt - 1).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
