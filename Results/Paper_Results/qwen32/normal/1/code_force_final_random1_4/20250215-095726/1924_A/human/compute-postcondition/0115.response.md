The given code snippet reads a new string `s` from the input. This means the original value of `s` is replaced by the newly read string. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are new integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a new integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new non-empty string read from the input, `cnt` is the total number of times `k` unique characters were found consecutively, `ans` is a string based on the conditions involving `cnt`, `tmp`, and `n`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
