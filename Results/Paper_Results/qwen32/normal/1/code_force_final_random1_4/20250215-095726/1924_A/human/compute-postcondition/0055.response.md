To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the relevant variables involved:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5.
- `n` and `k` are integers where 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.
- `m` is an integer where 1 <= m <= 1000.
- `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `cnt` is the number of complete sets of `k` characters found in `s`.
- `cur` is 0 if the last sequence of characters in `s` completes a set of `k` characters; otherwise, it reflects the incomplete set.
- `ans` is the last character(s) that completed a set of `k` characters followed by 'a' * (n - cnt - 1).
- `tmp` is an empty string.

Given the description, `ans` is constructed based on the last complete set of `k` characters in `s` and the remaining count until `cnt` reaches `n`.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of how `ans` is determined:
1. **Last Completed Set**: The last sequence of characters in `s` that completes a set of `k` characters.
2. **Remaining Characters**: Since `cnt` is the number of complete sets found and `cnt < n`, `ans` appends 'a' * (n - cnt - 1) to account for the remaining sets needed to reach `n`.

Since the exact values of `s`, `cnt`, and `cur` are not provided, we cannot determine the precise characters that completed the last set. However, we know the structure of `ans` based on the problem description.

Thus, the output of `print(ans)` will be the last character(s) that completed a set of `k` characters followed by 'a' * (n - cnt - 1).

Output: **ans (where ans consists of the last character(s) that completed a set of k characters followed by 'a' * (n - cnt - 1))**
