The given code snippet modifies the value of the variable `cur` by performing a bitwise OR operation with `1 << cur_ss`. This operation sets the bit at position `cur_ss` in the binary representation of `cur` to 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26
- `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000
- `s` is a new string of length m (where m >= 1) consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets
- `cnt` is 0
- `cur` is 0
- `ans` is an empty string
- `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and k-1 representing the 0-based index of `ss` in the alphabet
- `(cur & 1 << cur_ss) == 0` (which means the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is currently 0)

After executing the line `cur += 1 << cur_ss`, the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` will be set to 1. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer read from the input such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a new string of length m (where m >= 1) consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and k-1 representing the 0-based index of `ss` in the alphabet**
