Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5.
- `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 26.
- `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `cnt` is less than `n`.
- `ans` is a string containing the last character from each sequence of `k` unique characters.
- `tmp` is an empty string.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `cur` is 0 unless the last sequence did not reach `k` unique characters.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state are used in this specific print statement. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
