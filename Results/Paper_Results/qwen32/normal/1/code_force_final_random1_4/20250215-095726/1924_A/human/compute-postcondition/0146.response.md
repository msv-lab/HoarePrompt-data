Postcondition: **t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, n and k are integers with 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, m is an integer with 1 <= m <= 1000, s is a non-empty string, i is i + len(s), cur is the bitwise representation of the unique characters seen in the last incomplete set (or 0 if complete), cnt is the number of times k unique characters were seen consecutively, and cnt is greater than or equal to n, ans is the last character added when cur reached (1 << k) - 1.**
