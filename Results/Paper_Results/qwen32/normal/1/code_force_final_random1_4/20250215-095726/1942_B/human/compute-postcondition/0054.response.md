To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop head is defined as:

```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
```

This indicates that `i` is the variable being iterated over, starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is the input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element
- `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[i]` set to `mex - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`
- `i` is `len(ar) - 2`

We need to adjust the state for the next iteration. Since `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `len(ar) - 3`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `res`, and `mex`) do not change based on the loop head and thus remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[i]` set to `mex - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`**
