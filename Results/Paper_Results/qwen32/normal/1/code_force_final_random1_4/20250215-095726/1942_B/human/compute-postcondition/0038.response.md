To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `res` list and the `mex` variable.

### Loop Analysis
- The loop iterates over the indices of the list `ar` from the last index (`len(ar) - 1`) to the first index (`0`).
- For each index `i`, it sets `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`.
- It then checks if `mex > mex - ar[i]`. If true, it updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]`.

### Initial Conditions
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the length of the list `ar`.
- `ar` is a list of integers.
- `res` is a list of length `n` initialized with `None`.
- `mex` is initially set to `n`.

### Final Output State
After the loop completes, each element `res[i]` will hold the value `mex - ar[i]` as calculated during the iteration where `i` was the current index. The `mex` value will be the smallest non-negative integer that has not been assigned to any `res[i]` during the loop.

### Step-by-Step Calculation
1. Start with `mex = n`.
2. For each index `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`:
   - Calculate `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`.
   - Update `mex` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`.

By the end of the loop, `res` will be fully populated, and `mex` will reflect the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used in the `res` list.

### Output State Description
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `ar` remains unchanged.
- `res` is a list where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` as computed during the loop.
- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the `res` list.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input; `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` after the loop completes; `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the `res` list.**

In simple terms, the `res` list will contain the differences between the initial `mex` (which starts at `n`) and each element of `ar` in reverse order, and `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the `res` list after the loop finishes.
