Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element; `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[i]` set to `n - ar[i]`; `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `mex` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
