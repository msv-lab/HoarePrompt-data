To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and how the variables evolve through each iteration.

### Loop Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Length of the list `ar` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
     - `ar`: List of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ a_i ≤ n.
     - `res`: A list initialized with `None` values of length `n`.
     - `mex`: Initially set to `n`.

2. **Loop Body**:
   - For each index `i` from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`:
     - Compute `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
     - Update `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing each test case, print the list `res` as space-separated integers.

### Output State after All Iterations:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the total number of test cases.
- For each test case, the list `ar` is read from the input, and `res` is computed based on the logic described above.
- The variable `mex` is recalculated for each test case independently.
- The final output consists of `t` lines, each containing the `res` list for the corresponding test case.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will consist of `t` lines, each representing the `res` list for each test case.

**Output State:** **For each of the `t` test cases, a line containing `n` space-separated integers representing the `res` list computed as `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is a series of `t` lines, where each line corresponds to the result of processing one test case, showing the transformed list `res` for that particular test case.
