The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `ar`. This means that the value of `ar` will change to reflect the new list of integers provided by the input.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `ar` is now a list of integers with `len(ar)` elements, as provided by the input.
- `res` remains a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.
- `mex` remains the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` encountered during the loop.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input; `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`; `mex` is the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` encountered during the loop.**
