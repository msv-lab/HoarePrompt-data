Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least one element; `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. `i` remains `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**
