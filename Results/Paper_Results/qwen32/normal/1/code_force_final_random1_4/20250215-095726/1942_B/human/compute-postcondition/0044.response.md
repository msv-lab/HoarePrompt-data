The value of `mex` is explicitly set to `n`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is the list of integers provided by the input; `res` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `None`; `mex` is `n`.**
