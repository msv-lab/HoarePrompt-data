The code snippet updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Given the initial state, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. Additionally, the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]` ensures that `mex` is set to the smaller value between the current `mex` and `mex - ar[i]`. Since `mex` is reassigned to `mex - ar[i]` before the condition is checked, the condition effectively does nothing because `mex` will always be equal to `mex - ar[i]` after the assignment.

Thus, the only change is in the value of `mex`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least one element; `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is now `mex - ar[i]`; `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`; `i` is \(k - 2\)**.
