Given the code snippet and the initial state, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is the input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least one element
- `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is initially set to `mex - ar[i]`
- If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`
- `i` is \(k - 2\)

Code Snippet:
```python
res[i] = mex - ar[i]
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.

Since the code only updates the value of `res[i]` and does not modify `t`, `n`, `ar`, or `mex` directly (except through the condition that affects `mex`), the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least one element; `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is now `mex - ar[i]`; if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`; `i` is \(k - 2\)**

In simpler terms, the value of `res[i]` is now `mex - ar[i]`, and if `mex` was greater than `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` is updated accordingly. All other variables retain their initial values.
