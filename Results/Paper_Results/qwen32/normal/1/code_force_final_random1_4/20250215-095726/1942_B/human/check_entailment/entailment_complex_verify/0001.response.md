### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program using the provided annotations and the problem description to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the array `a`, where each element `a_i` is defined as `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. Here, `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer not present in the array up to that point.

#### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to reconstruct the permutation `p` in reverse order. It initializes `mex` to `n` (the maximum possible value for `MEX` at the start) and iterates through the array `a` from the last element to the first. For each element `a_i`, it calculates `p_i` as `mex - a_i`. It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `mex - a_i`.

#### Key Points:
1. **Initialization**: `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the highest possible value for `MEX` initially.
2. **Reverse Iteration**: The program processes the array `a` from the end to the beginning. This approach is logical because `MEX` values are influenced by all previous elements, and processing in reverse allows us to use the `mex` value effectively.
3. **Calculation of `p_i`**: For each `a_i`, `p_i` is calculated as `mex - a_i`.
4. **Updating `mex`**: After calculating `p_i`, `mex` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p_i`. This ensures that `mex` always holds the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation `p`.

#### Verification:
To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided:

#### Example 1:
```
Input:
5
1 1 -2 1 2

Processing:
i = 4: a[4] = 2, mex = 5 -> p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3, mex = min(5, 3) = 3
i = 3: a[3] = 1, mex = 3 -> p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2, mex = min(3, 2) = 2
i = 2: a[2] = -2, mex = 2 -> p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4, mex = min(2, 4) = 2
i = 1: a[1] = 1, mex = 2 -> p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1, mex = min(2, 1) = 1
i = 0: a[0] = 1, mex = 1 -> p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0, mex = min(1, 0) = 0

Result: p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]
```

This matches the expected output for the first test case.

However, let's consider another example to ensure the program handles all edge cases correctly:

#### Example 2:
```
Input:
5
1 1 1 1 1

Processing:
i = 4: a[4] = 1, mex = 5 -> p[4] = 5 - 1 = 4, mex = min(5, 4) = 4
i = 3: a[3] = 1, mex = 4 -> p[3] = 4 - 1 = 3, mex = min(4, 3) = 3
i = 2: a[2] = 1, mex = 3 -> p[2] = 3 - 1 = 2, mex = min(3, 2) = 2
i = 1: a[1] = 1, mex = 2 -> p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1, mex = min(2, 1) = 1
i = 0: a[0] = 1, mex = 1 -> p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0, mex = min(1, 0) = 0

Result: p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

This also matches the expected output for the second test case.

#### Example 3:
```
Input:
3
-2 1 2

Processing:
i = 2: a[2] = 2, mex = 3 -> p[2] = 3 - 2 = 1, mex = min(3, 1) = 1
i = 1: a[1] = 1, mex = 1 -> p[1] = 1 - 1 = 0, mex = min(1, 0) = 0
i = 0: a[0] = -2, mex = 0 -> p[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2, mex = min(0, 2) = 0

Result: p = [2, 0, 1]
```

This also matches the expected output for the third test case.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and verification with multiple examples, the program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` from the array `a` by iterating in reverse and updating the `mex` value appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
