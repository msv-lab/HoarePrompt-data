Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element; `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[i]` set to `mex - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. `i` is `len(ar) - 2`.**
