The given code snippet updates the value of `res[i]` based on the current value of `mex` and `ar[i]`. Here's the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[i]` set to `mex - ar[i]` (previously `n - ar[i]`), `mex` remains unchanged, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`**

In simpler terms:
- `t` remains the same integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` remains the same input integer.
- `ar` remains the same list of integers.
- `res[i]` is now updated to `mex - ar[i]`.
- `mex` does not change.
- `i` remains `len(ar) - 2`.
