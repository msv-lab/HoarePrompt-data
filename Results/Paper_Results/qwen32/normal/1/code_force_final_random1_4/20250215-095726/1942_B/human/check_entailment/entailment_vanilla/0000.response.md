Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We need to reconstruct a permutation `p` of length `n` from the given array `a` of length `n`. Each element `a_i` in `a` is defined as:

\[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]

Where `\texttt{MEX}` is the minimum non-negative integer not present in the sequence up to that point.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution attempts to construct the permutation `p` in reverse order. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` values with length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Reverse Construction**:
   - The loop iterates from the end of the array `ar` to the beginning.
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - After constructing `res`, it prints the elements of `res` as the permutation `p`.

### Key Points to Consider

- **MEX Calculation**: The MEX value should always be the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation. By iterating backwards and updating `mex` appropriately, we can ensure this property.
- **Correctness of Reverse Construction**: The reverse construction approach ensures that when we calculate `res[i]`, the MEX value (`mex`) correctly reflects the smallest unused integer up to that point in the reversed sequence.
- **Updating MEX**: The update `mex = min(mex, mex - ar[i])` ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not yet used.

### Verification

Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `n=5`, `a=[1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `p=[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`
   - Calculation:
     - `i=4`: `res[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
     - `i=3`: `res[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
     - `i=2`: `res[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
     - `i=1`: `res[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
     - `i=0`: `res[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
   - Result: `p=[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `n=5`, `a=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `p=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Calculation:
     - `i=4`: `res[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = min(5, 4) = 4`
     - `i=3`: `res[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = min(4, 3) = 3`
     - `i=2`: `res[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
     - `i=1`: `res[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
     - `i=0`: `res[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
   - Result: `p=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `n=3`, `a=[-2, 1, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `p=[2, 0, 1]`
   - Calculation:
     - `i=2`: `res[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = min(3, 1) = 1`
     - `i=1`: `res[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
     - `i=0`: `res[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = min(0, 2) = 0`
   - Result: `p=[2, 0, 1]`

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly constructs the permutation `p` from the given array `a` by reversing the process and maintaining the correct MEX value at each step. Therefore, the solution is correct.

**Correctness: True**
