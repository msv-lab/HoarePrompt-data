The given code snippet updates the value of `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`. No other variables are explicitly modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is the input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least one element
- `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is initially `n - ar[i]`
- `mex` is updated conditionally based on the comparison `mex > mex - ar[i]`
- `i` is `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration

After executing the line `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`, the value of `res[i]` changes from its initial value (`n - ar[i]`) to `mex - ar[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least one element; `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`; `mex` is updated conditionally based on the comparison `mex > mex - ar[i]`; `i` is `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**
