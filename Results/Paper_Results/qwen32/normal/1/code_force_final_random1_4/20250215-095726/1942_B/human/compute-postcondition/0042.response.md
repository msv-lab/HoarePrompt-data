The given code snippet updates the `ar` variable by reading a list of integers from the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `res`, and `mex`) remain unchanged by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is the list of integers provided by the input; `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` after the loop completes; `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the `res` list.**
