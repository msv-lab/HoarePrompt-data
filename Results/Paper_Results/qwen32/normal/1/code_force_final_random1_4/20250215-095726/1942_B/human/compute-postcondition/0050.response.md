To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):`, which means the loop variable `i` is being decremented from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is the input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element
- `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[i]` set to `n - ar[i]`
- `mex` is updated based on the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged.

Since the loop iterates over `i` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`.

### Step-by-step Adjustment:
1. Identify the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
2. Decrement `i` by 1 to get the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration.

### Example Adjustment:
If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `2`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `1`.

### General Adjustment:
If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`.

### Final State:
Assuming `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[i]` set to `n - ar[i]`, `mex` is updated based on the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged, `i` is `k - 1`**

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we express the state in terms of `k - 1`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[i]` set to `n - ar[i]`, `mex` is updated based on the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged, `i` is `i - 1`**

However, if we assume `i` was `len(ar) - 1` at the end of the first iteration (the last element of the list), then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `len(ar) - 2`.

So, the most specific answer given the loop structure would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[i]` set to `n - ar[i]`, `mex` is updated based on the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`**

But generally, it should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[i]` set to `n - ar[i]`, `mex` is updated based on the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged, `i` is `i - 1`**

For the sake of specificity in the context of the loop decrementing from the end of the list:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[i]` set to `n - ar[i]`, `mex` is updated based on the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains unchanged, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`**
