The code assigns the value `mex - ar[i]` to `res[i]`. Given that `mex` is `n` and `ar` is a list of integers, `res[i]` will now hold the value `n - ar[i]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, and `mex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 element; `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[i]` set to `n - ar[i]`; `mex` is `n`.**
