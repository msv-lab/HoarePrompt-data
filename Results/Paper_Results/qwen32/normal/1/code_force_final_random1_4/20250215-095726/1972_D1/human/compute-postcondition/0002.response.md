In this case, the loop head involves the function `func_10()` which determines the number of iterations the loop will execute. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop condition directly.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing. Since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body (as indicated by it being a throwaway variable), we don't need to adjust its state.

The only state that needs adjustment is the return value of `func_10()`. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a value greater than the current iteration count. Since we don't know the exact number of iterations completed so far, we can assume that `func_10()` should return a value that is at least 1 more than the current iteration count.

However, since we are only adjusting the state based on the given information and not keeping track of the iteration count, we can simply state that `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0; the value returned by `func_15()` is written to the standard output followed by a newline character.**
