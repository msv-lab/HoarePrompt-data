You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, processing is a list of integers initialized to 0, da is an integer key present in the dictionary d, rank is a list of integers.
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers initialized to 0, `da` is an integer key present in the dictionary `d`, `rank` is a list of integers, `tmp` is `1000000000`. The length of the list `d[da]` is greater than 1.
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `da` is an integer key present in the dictionary `d` such that the length of `d[da]` is greater than 1, `processing` is a list of integers (all elements remain unchanged from their initial state because they are reset to `0` after being set to `1`), `rank` is a list of integers, and `tmp` is the minimum value among all the values returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially `0`.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value among all the values returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially `0`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_12` accepts four parameters: a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` initialized to 0, an integer `da` which is a key present in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank`. The function returns `1` if a certain condition is met (Case_1). Otherwise, it returns `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from recursive calls to `func_12` for each element `di` in the list `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially `0` (Case_2).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: The program returns `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value among all the values returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially `0`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
