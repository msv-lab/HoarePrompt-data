Functionality: **The function `func_15` calculates a value based on the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for `j` from 1 to `i - 1`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers obtained from another function `func_7()`. Here, `i` is determined by the condition `i * i <= n + i`. The function returns this calculated sum minus one.**
