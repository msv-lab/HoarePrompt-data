Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    func_16()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads an integer from the standard input and returns it.

def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads two integers from standard input and returns them as a map object.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns a list of these integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function accepts a positive integer `rows_number` representing the number of test cases and returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` that many times.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace from the line, and returns the resulting string. This string typically contains space-separated integers representing values for a test case.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function reads a line from standard input, decodes it from bytes to a string, removes any trailing newline characters, and returns the resulting string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` reads two integers from standard input, separated by a space, and returns them as a list of two integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` takes a single parameter `rows`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. It returns a list of length `rows`, where each element is the result of calling `func_7()` for each test case.
Function number 9 :
 Code:

def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` reads a line of input from the standard input and returns it.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` reads an integer from the input and returns that integer.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function takes no input and returns a list of strings by splitting the user-provided input string at each whitespace.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` calculates and updates the rank of a given node `da` in a graph represented by a dictionary `d`. It recursively explores the neighbors of `da` (stored in `d[da]`), ensuring no cycles are revisited using the `processing` list. If `da` has only one neighbor, it returns 1. Otherwise, it computes the minimum rank among its neighbors and assigns `tmp + 1` to `rank[da - 1]`, where `tmp` is the smallest value returned by recursive calls.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, and also returns the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = GCD(a, b)`. It returns a tuple `(x, y, GCD(a, b))`.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):

            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, and three additional integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It iterates over the first `n` elements of the list `a`. For each element less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and the element. After processing these elements, it returns 1 if `k` is non-negative, otherwise, it returns -1.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` calculates a value based on the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for `j` from 1 to `i - 1`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers obtained from another function `func_7()`. Here, `i` is determined by the condition `i * i <= n + i`. The function returns this calculated sum minus one.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves computing the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` based on some criteria (indirectly provided by `func_15`). It outputs the result for each test case, with the number of test cases determined by another function (`func_10`).
