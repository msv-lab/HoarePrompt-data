### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided functions to see if they collectively solve the problem correctly.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Analysis of Functions:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1()`, `func_2()`, `func_3()`, `func_4()`, `func_5()`, `func_6()`, `func_7()`, `func_8()`, `func_9()`, `func_10()`, `func_11()`: These functions are primarily for reading input. They handle reading integers and lists of integers from standard input. They seem to be correctly implemented for reading the required inputs for the problem.

2. **GCD Calculation:**
   - `func_13(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. It returns a tuple \((x, y, g)\) where \(g\) is the GCD and \(x, y\) are the coefficients satisfying \(ax + by = g\). This function is correctly implemented for calculating the GCD.

3. **Unrelated Functions:**
   - `func_12(d, processing, da, rank)`: This function appears to be related to graph traversal or ranking nodes in a graph. It is not relevant to the problem at hand.
   - `func_14(a, n, m, k)`: This function seems to be related to some kind of array manipulation and checking if a condition is met. It is not relevant to the problem at hand.

4. **Main Calculation:**
   - `func_15()`: This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\). However, the implementation provided does not match the problem requirements. The function currently calculates a value based on the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for \(j\) from 1 to \(i - 1\), where \(i\) is determined by the condition \(i * i <= n + i\). This does not align with the problem's requirement to check pairs \((a, b)\) and verify the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   
5. **Execution Loop:**
   - `func_16()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_15()` for each test case and printing the result. Since `func_15()` is not correctly implemented according to the problem statement, the overall program will not produce the correct results.

### Conclusion:
The main function `func_15()` is not correctly implementing the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. Therefore, the entire program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
