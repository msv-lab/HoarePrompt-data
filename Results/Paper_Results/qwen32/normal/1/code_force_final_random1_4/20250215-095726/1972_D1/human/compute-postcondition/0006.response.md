To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and the functions `func_10` and `func_15`.

- `func_10()` returns the total number of test cases `t`.
- `func_15()` computes the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for each test case given `n` and `m`.

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the value returned by `func_10()`. For each iteration, `func_15()` is called, and its result is printed on a new line.

From the provided information:
- After 1 iteration, `func_15()` was called once, and its result was printed.
- After 2 iterations, `func_15()` was called twice, and its results were printed on separate lines.
- After 3 iterations, `func_15()` was called three times, and its results were printed on separate lines.

Following this pattern, after all `t` iterations, `func_15()` will have been called `t` times, and its results will have been printed on `t` separate lines.

Therefore, the final output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing the result of one call to `func_15()`.

Output State: **The output consists of `t` lines, each line containing the result of `func_15()` for each test case, separated by newline characters.**
