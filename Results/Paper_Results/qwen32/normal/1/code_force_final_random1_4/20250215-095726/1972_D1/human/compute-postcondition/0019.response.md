Postcondition: **`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `da` is an integer key present in the dictionary `d` such that the length of `d[da]` is greater than 1, `processing` is a list of integers, `rank` is a list of integers, `tmp` is the minimum of its previous value and the value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`, and `di` is the next element in `d[da]` after the current `di`. If `processing[di - 1]` was `0`, the element at index `di - 1` in `processing` remains `0`.**
