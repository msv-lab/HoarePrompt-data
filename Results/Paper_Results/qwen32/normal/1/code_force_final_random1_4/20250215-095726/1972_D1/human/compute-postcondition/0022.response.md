Output State: **The program returns `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value among all the values returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially `0`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The program calculates the minimum value (`tmp`) from the results of calling `func_12` for each element `di` in the list `d[da]` under the condition that `processing[di - 1]` was initially `0`. It then adds `1` to this minimum value and returns the result.
