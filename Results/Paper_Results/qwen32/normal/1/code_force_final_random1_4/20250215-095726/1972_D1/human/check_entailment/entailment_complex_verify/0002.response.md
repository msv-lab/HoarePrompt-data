### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem statement and the provided code, especially focusing on the core logic implemented in `func_15`.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The main function that seems relevant is `func_15`, which is supposed to compute the number of valid pairs for given \(n\) and \(m\).

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

#### Detailed Examination:
- The loop runs while \(i \times i \leq n + i\).
- For each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // (i \times i)\) to `ans`.
- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

The logic in `func_15` does not explicitly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be counting something related to divisors, but it does not incorporate the \(b\) and \(\gcd(a, b)\) condition.

#### Verification Using Annotations:
The annotations confirm that `func_15` does not utilize \(m\) and does not perform any checks related to \(b\) and \(\gcd(a, b)\):

```plaintext
#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

The annotations state that `func_15` calculates a value based on the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for \(j\) from 1 to \(i - 1\), but it does not consider the condition involving \(b\) and \(\gcd(a, b)\).

#### Conclusion:
Given the analysis and the annotations, it is clear that `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), which is a critical part of the problem statement.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
