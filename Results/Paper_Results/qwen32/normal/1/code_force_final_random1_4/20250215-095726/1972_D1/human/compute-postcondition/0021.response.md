Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `da` is an integer key present in the dictionary `d` such that the length of `d[da]` is greater than 1, `processing` is a list of integers (all elements remain unchanged from their initial state because they are reset to `0` after being set to `1`), `rank` is a list of integers where `rank[da - 1]` is now `tmp + 1`, and `tmp` is the minimum value among all the values returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially `0`.**

In simple terms, the value of `rank[da - 1]` has been updated to `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the smallest value obtained from calling `func_12` for each element in `d[da]` that was initially unprocessed (`processing[di - 1]` was `0`). All other variables retain their initial states.
