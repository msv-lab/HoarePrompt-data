In the given for loop, the loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable when the variable itself is not used within the loop body. The loop runs for a number of times equal to the integer value provided by the input.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust the state for the next iteration. Since the loop variable `_` is not used inside the loop, it does not affect the program state in terms of variables we need to track. However, the loop will execute as long as the number of iterations specified by the input has not been reached.

Here's the analysis:

- The loop will run `int(input())` times.
- After each iteration, the loop counter (which is `_` and not explicitly tracked) is incremented.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `ar`, `res`, and `mex` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be modified based on the loop head rules.

Since the loop variable `_` is not relevant to the state we need to track, and no other variables in the loop head need adjustment, the state remains the same except for the implicit increment of the loop counter.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, except that the loop is set to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input; `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` after the loop completes; `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the `res` list.**
