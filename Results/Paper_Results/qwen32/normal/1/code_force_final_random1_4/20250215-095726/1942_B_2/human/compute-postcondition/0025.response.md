To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
```

This indicates that the loop variable `i` will iterate from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`. Therefore, the state of `ar` (the list being iterated over) is crucial for the loop to execute.

Let's analyze the requirements:

1. **`ar`**: The list `ar` must have at least one element for the loop to execute because `range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1)` requires `len(ar) - 1` to be a non-negative integer. This means `ar` must have a length of at least 1.

2. **`i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to `len(ar) - 1` at the start of the loop. We don't need to explicitly set `i` in the initial state because it is automatically set by the `range` function.

3. **`n`**: Although `n` is mentioned in the initial state, it is not directly used in the loop head. However, since `res` is a list of length `n`, and `mex` is `n`, we should ensure that `n` is consistent with the length of `ar` if there are dependencies between them. For the loop itself, `n` does not need adjustment.

4. **`res` and `mex`**: These variables are not part of the loop head and thus do not need adjustment based solely on the loop head. However, for completeness, we should note their initial states as provided.

Given these points, the necessary adjustment is ensuring that `ar` has at least one element. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least one element; `res` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `None`; `mex` is `n`.**
