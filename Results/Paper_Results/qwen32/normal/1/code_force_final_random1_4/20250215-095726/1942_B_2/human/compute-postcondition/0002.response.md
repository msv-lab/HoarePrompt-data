The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `ar`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Given that `n` is an input integer, it implies that `n` represents the number of integers expected in the input line. However, the code does not explicitly use `n` to control the number of elements read from the input; it simply reads all space-separated integers until the end of the line.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers read from the input.**
