### Reasoning:

The given program aims to construct a permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the relationship \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation `p`.
   - `res` is an array of size `n` initialized with `None`, which will store the resulting permutation.

2. **Iterating backwards through `a`**:
   - The loop iterates from the last index to the first index of `a`.
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - After calculating `res[i]`, it updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `res[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always holds the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `res`.

3. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `res` for each test case, the program prints the elements of `res`.

### Analysis:

The logic of the program seems flawed because it does not correctly ensure that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `res` at each step. Instead, it simply updates `mex` to the minimum of its current value and `res[i]`, which can lead to incorrect results.

To correctly compute `mex`, we need to maintain a set or a boolean array to keep track of which numbers have already been used in `res`. Here's a corrected version of the approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a set `used` to keep track of numbers that have been added to `res`.
   - Initialize `mex` to `0`.

2. **Iterate through `a`**:
   - For each index `i`, calculate `p_i` as `mex + ar[i]`.
   - Add `p_i` to the `used` set.
   - Update `mex` to the next smallest non-negative integer not in `used`.

3. **Output**:
   - Print the resulting permutation `res`.

Given the above analysis, the original program does not correctly implement the required logic to find the permutation `p`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
