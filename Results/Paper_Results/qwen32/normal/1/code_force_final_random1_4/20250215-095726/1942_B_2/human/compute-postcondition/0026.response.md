The code assigns the value `mex - ar[i]` to `res[i]`. Given the initial state, `mex` is `n` and `ar` is a list of integers. After the execution of the line, `res[i]` will hold the value `n - ar[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least one element; `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]`; `mex` is `n`.**
