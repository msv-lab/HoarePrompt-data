Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). The main issue lies in how the MEX value is updated and used to calculate the permutation elements.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program initializes `mex` to `n` and updates it incorrectly. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of the permutation \( p \), but the program simply subtracts `ar[i]` from `mex` without ensuring that the resulting value is indeed the MEX.

2. **Reverse Iteration**: The program iterates over the array `ar` in reverse order, which is unnecessary and incorrect for constructing the permutation \( p \).

3. **Updating MEX**: The condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]:` is not sufficient to ensure that `mex` is updated correctly. It should check whether the computed value `mex - ar[i]` is already used in the permutation or not.

To fix these issues, we need to maintain a set of used numbers and correctly compute the MEX for each position in the permutation. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            used.add(res[i])
        
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the MEX is computed correctly and that each element of the permutation is unique and valid.
