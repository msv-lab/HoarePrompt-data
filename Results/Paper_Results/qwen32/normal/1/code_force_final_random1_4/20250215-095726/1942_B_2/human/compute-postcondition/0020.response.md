The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable that can be adjusted here is the implicit loop variable `_`, but since it is not used within the loop body, adjusting its value does not affect the loop's behavior or the program state.

However, the number of iterations is determined by `int(input())`, which means the loop will run a specific number of times based on the input provided. Since the loop variable `_` is not used, we don't need to adjust it. Instead, we need to consider how the input affects the loop's execution.

Given that the loop runs `int(input())` times, the state at the start of the next iteration doesn't change any of the variables `t`, `n`, `ar`, `res`, or `mex` directly. These variables are not part of the loop head and thus their values remain unchanged from the end of the previous iteration to the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state remains the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with `len(ar)` elements; `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`; `mex` is the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` encountered during the loop.**
