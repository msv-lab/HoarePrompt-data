The given code snippet initializes the list `res` with `None` values, specifically setting its length to `n`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, or `mex`. The only change is that `res` now contains `n` elements, all set to `None`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is the list of integers provided by the input; `res` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `None`; `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the `res` list.**
