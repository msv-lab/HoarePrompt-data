The code snippet `mex = mex - ar[i]` updates the value of `mex` by subtracting the value of `ar[i]` from it. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `res`, and `i` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least one element; `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`; `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`; `i` is `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**
