To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head is defined as:

```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
```

From this, we can see that the variable `i` is the only one that can be adjusted. The loop iterates from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is the input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least one element
- `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`
- `i` remains `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k - 1`.
2. **Loop Iteration**: The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration.
3. **Next State**: For the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 2`.

Since the other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `res`) are not part of the loop head, they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least one element, `res` is a list of length `n` where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`, `i` is \(k - 2\)**
