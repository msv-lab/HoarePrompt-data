The code appends a calculated value to the list `array2`. The value being appended is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression evaluates to `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`.

Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `i` is 2, `array2` has an additional element which is `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`.**
