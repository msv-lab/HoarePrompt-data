The code appends a calculated value to the list `array2`. This calculated value is the result of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given that `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`.

Therefore, the updated `array2` will contain one element, which is `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`.

Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `array2` contains one element `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`, `i` is 1**.
