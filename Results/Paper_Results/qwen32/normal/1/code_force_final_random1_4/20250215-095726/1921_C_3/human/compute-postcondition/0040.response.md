The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the for loop statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, and `array2` includes the newly appended value `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a` if `arr[2] - arr[1] < b / a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged. `i` is 3**
