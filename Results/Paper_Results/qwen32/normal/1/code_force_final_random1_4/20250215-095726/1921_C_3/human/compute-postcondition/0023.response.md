The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state provides a detailed description of various variables and lists (`test_cases`, `t`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `array2`) and their relationships, but these details do not affect the execution of the `print` statement itself. 

The `print('No')` statement will execute and print the string `'No'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Therefore, the output of the code is:

Output: **No**
