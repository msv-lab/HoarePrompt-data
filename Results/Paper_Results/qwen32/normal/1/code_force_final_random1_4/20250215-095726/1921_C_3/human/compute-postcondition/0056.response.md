Output State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `array2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is the creation of a new variable `array2` which is initialized as an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.
