The code snippet assigns the last element of the list `feat` to the variable `b`. Since `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `feat[-1]` refers to the last element of this list, `b` will now hold this value.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `test_cases` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `feat` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains `feat[0]`.
- `f` remains `feat[1]`.
- `a` remains `feat[2]`.
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, but since we are only concerned with the state after the given line of code, `i` is not updated in the output state description.

Output State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
