The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `test_cases`. This integer represents the number of test cases to be processed. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the list `m` remain unchanged as they are not referenced or modified in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ `f`, `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9; the second line contains `n` integers `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n` such that 1 ≤ `m_i` ≤ 10^9 and `m_i` < `m_{i+1}`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
