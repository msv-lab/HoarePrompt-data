Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `array2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is the creation of `array2`, which is initialized as an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values.
