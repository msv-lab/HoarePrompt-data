### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Initial Charge**: `f`
2. **Charge Consumption per Unit Time**: `a`
3. **Charge Consumption for Turning Off and On**: `b`
4. **Messages to Send**: `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` at specific moments.

#### Objective:
Determine if Stepan can send all messages without the phone's charge dropping to zero or below at any point.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It initializes an empty list `array2`.
   - It iterates through the message times starting from the second message.
   - For each pair of consecutive message times (`arr[i]` and `arr[i-1]`), it checks if the time difference is less than `b/a`.
     - If true, it appends the charge consumed during this period (`(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a`) to `array2`.
   - It calculates the total charge consumed by summing up the values in `array2` and adding `b` for each message that was not covered by the previous condition (`(n - len(array2)) * b`).
   - It compares this total charge consumption with the initial charge `f`.
     - If the total charge consumption is less than `f`, it prints "Yes".
     - Otherwise, it prints "No".

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Condition for Turning Off and On**:
  - The condition `if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:` is incorrect. The phone should be turned off and on if the charge would drop to zero or below if the phone were kept on until the next message.
  - The correct condition should check if the charge would drop to zero or below if the phone were kept on until the next message, which is `if (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a > f:`.

- **Charge Calculation**:
  - The program incorrectly sums up the charges for periods where the phone is kept on and adds `b` for each message that was not covered by the previous condition. This approach does not correctly account for the optimal strategy of turning off and on the phone.

#### Correct Approach:
- For each message, calculate the charge remaining if the phone is kept on until the next message.
- If the charge would drop to zero or below, turn off and on the phone before sending the message.
- Keep track of the total charge consumed and compare it with the initial charge.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the program, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
