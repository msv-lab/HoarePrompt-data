The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts each part into an integer, storing these integers in the list `feat`. This operation updates the value of `feat` but does not affect the other variables (`test_cases`, `t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `array2`, `i`).

Since `feat` is reassigned, its new value is a list of integers derived from the input. The other variables retain their previous values unless they are explicitly updated in subsequent code (which is not shown here).

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `array2` is a list containing `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, `i` is incremented by 1**. 

Natural Language: The variable `feat` is now a list of integers obtained from the input. All other variables (`test_cases`, `t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `array2`, `i`) remain unchanged.
