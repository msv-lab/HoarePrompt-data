Postcondition: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, and the current value of `i` is 0. If the first element of `arr` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains one element which is `[arr[0] * a]`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.**
