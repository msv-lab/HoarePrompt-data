The code assigns the third element of the list `feat` to the variable `a`. Therefore, `a` now holds the value `feat[2]`. The values of `i`, `feat`, `n`, and `f` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `n` is `feat[0]`; `f` is `feat[1]`; `a` is `feat[2]`.**
