The code appends a calculated value to the list `array2`. Specifically, it calculates `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` and adds this value to `array2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions, the only change is that `array2` now contains one additional element, which is the result of the calculation.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input where the first element `n` is greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `array2` is a list containing the new element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`, and the current element `arr[i]` minus the previous element `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`.**
