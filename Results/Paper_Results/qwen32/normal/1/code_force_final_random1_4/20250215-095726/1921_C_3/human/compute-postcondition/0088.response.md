The code appends the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to the list `array2`. Given that `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, the specific value being appended is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.

Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `array2` is a list containing the single element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`, and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, the current value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`.**
