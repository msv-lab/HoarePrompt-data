To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided information.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive), meaning it will run `n-1` times.
- In each iteration, it checks if the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`.
- If the condition is met, it appends the product of the difference and `a` to `array2`.

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes all its iterations (`n-1` times), the following will be true:
- `test_cases`, `t`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `array2` will contain all the elements that were appended during the iterations where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` was satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The final state of `array2` will include all the products `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for which the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` was true during the iterations from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `array2` is a list containing `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.**
