The given code snippet appends a calculated value to the `array2` list. Specifically, it calculates `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` and appends this value to `array2`. 

Given the initial state, the value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`. This condition does not affect the calculation but ensures that the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is within a certain bound.

Here's the updated state:

- `test_cases` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `feat` remains a list of integers read from the input.
- `n` remains `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1.
- `f` remains `feat[1]`.
- `a` remains `feat[2]`.
- `b` remains the last element of `feat`.
- `arr` remains a new list of integers read from the input.
- `array2` now includes the newly appended value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `array2` includes the newly appended value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**
