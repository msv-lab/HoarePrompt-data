Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `i + 1`; `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `n` is `feat[0]`; `f` is `feat[1]`; `a` is `feat[2]`; `b` is `feat[-1]`; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `array2` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if i == 0:
        if arr[0] < b / a:
            array2.append(arr[0] * a)
    elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, and `array2` is a list that may contain one element depending on the conditions. If `i` is 0 and the first element of `arr` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains one element which is `[arr[0] * a]`. If `i` is not 0 and `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains one element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, and `i` is 1. Since the if condition (`i == 0`) is false, the else part is executed. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains one element `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged (potentially empty).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, and `i` is 2. If `i` were 0 (which it is not in this case), the behavior would depend on `arr[0] < b / a`; however, since `i` is 2, the behavior depends on `arr[2] - arr[1] < b / a`. If `arr[2] - arr[1] < b / a`, then `array2` has an additional element which is `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
