To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given Initial State:
- `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from a new input.
- `array2` is a list that may contain one element depending on the conditions.
- `i` is 1.

Code Snippet:
```python
array2.append(arr[0] * a)
```

The code appends the product of `arr[0]` and `a` to the list `array2`. 

Since the value of `a` is not provided in the initial state, we will denote the new element added to `array2` as `arr[0] * a`.

Impact on Variables:
- `array2` will now contain its previous elements plus the new element `arr[0] * a`.

Other variables (`feat`, `n`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `array2` contains its previous elements plus `arr[0] * a`, `i` is 1.**
