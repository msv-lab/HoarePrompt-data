Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input where the first element `n` is greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `array2` is an empty list, and the current element `arr[i]` minus the previous element `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`.**
