To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables involved.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. During each iteration, it checks if the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`. If the condition is met, it appends a calculated value to `array2`.

Given the pattern of the output states after the first three iterations, we can generalize the final state after all iterations:

- `test_cases` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `feat` remains unchanged as a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `n` remains unchanged as the first element of `feat`.
- `f` remains unchanged as the second element of `feat`.
- `a` remains unchanged as the third element of `feat`.
- `b` remains unchanged as the last element of `feat`.
- `arr` remains unchanged as a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `i` will be equal to `n-1` after the loop completes.
- `array2` will contain elements that were appended during the iterations where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` was true.

The final value of `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1` inclusive.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `n-1`, and `array2` contains elements `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `i` will be `n-1`, and `array2` will have all the calculated values appended based on the condition being true during each iteration. All other variables remain unchanged.
