Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Understanding
Stepan needs to send `n` messages at specific times `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`. He starts with `f` units of battery charge. His phone consumes `a` units of charge per unit of time it is on and `b` units of charge whenever he turns the phone off and then on again. The goal is to determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of battery.

### Key Points
1. **Initial Charge**: `f`
2. **Charge Consumption**:
   - `a` units per unit of time the phone is on.
   - `b` units when the phone is turned off and on.
3. **Messages**: Sent at moments `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`.
4. **Objective**: Determine if Stepan can send all messages without the battery dropping to 0 or below.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It reads the list of message times `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` and prepends a `0` to it to simplify calculations.
   - It iterates through each message time from `m_1` to `m_n`:
     - For each interval `[m_(i-1), m_i]`, it calculates the charge consumed if the phone remains on during this interval (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`).
     - It also considers the charge consumed if the phone is turned off and on again (`b`).
     - It subtracts the minimum of these two values from the current charge `f`.
   - After processing all intervals, it checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0. If so, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check
The logic seems correct because:
- The program correctly calculates the charge consumed for each interval between messages.
- It considers both scenarios: keeping the phone on and turning it off/on.
- It chooses the scenario that consumes the least charge.
- Finally, it checks if the remaining charge is sufficient to send all messages.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the first test case from the example:
- Input: `1 3 1 5` and `3`
- Initial charge: `f = 3`
- Interval: `[0, 3]`
- Charge consumed if on: `a * (3 - 0) = 1 * 3 = 3`
- Charge consumed if off/on: `b = 5`
- Minimum charge consumed: `min(3, 5) = 3`
- Remaining charge: `f - 3 = 0`
- Since the remaining charge is 0, the program should output "NO", which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
