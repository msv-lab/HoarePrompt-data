The value of `a` is updated to `feat[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
