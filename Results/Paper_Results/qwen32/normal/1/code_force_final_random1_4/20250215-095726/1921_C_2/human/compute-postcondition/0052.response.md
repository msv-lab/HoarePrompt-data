The code assigns the second element of the list `feat` to the variable `f`. The values of `test_cases`, `t`, `feat`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Output State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
