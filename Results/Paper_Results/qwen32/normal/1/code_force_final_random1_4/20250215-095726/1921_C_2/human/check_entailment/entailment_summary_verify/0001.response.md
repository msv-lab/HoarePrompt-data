### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem described.

#### Problem Description Recap:
Stepan needs to send `n` messages at specific moments (`m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`). He starts with `f` units of charge, and his phone consumes `a` units of charge per unit of time. Additionally, turning the phone off and then on consumes `b` units of charge. The goal is to determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of battery.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the list of message times and calculating the charge consumed between messages. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the parameters `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are read.
   - The list of message times `arr` is read.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - An empty list `array2` is initialized.
   - For each pair of consecutive message times, if the time difference is less than `b / a`, the charge consumed while keeping the phone on is calculated and added to `array2`.
   - After processing all pairs, the total charge consumed is calculated as the sum of values in `array2` plus `b` for each segment where the phone was turned off and on.
   - If the total charge consumed is less than the initial charge `f`, "Yes" is printed; otherwise, "No" is printed.

#### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Incomplete Charge Calculation:**
   - The program only considers segments where the time difference is less than `b / a` and adds the charge consumed in those segments to `array2`.
   - It does not account for the charge consumed when the phone is turned off and on, which is crucial for determining the total charge consumption.

2. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The program does not compare the charge consumed in both scenarios (keeping the phone on vs. turning it off and on) for each pair of consecutive messages.
   - It incorrectly assumes that if the time difference is greater than `b / a`, the phone must be turned off and on, which is not always the case.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the initial charge `f` is insufficient to send the first message.
   - It does not handle cases where the phone needs to be turned off and on multiple times between messages.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through the list of message times and decide whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on for each pair of consecutive messages. We should compare the charge consumed in both scenarios and choose the one that minimizes the total charge consumed.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initial charge
        current_charge = f
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                # Time from 0 to first message
                time_diff = arr[i]
            else:
                # Time between consecutive messages
                time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
            
            # Cost if we keep the phone on
            cost_on = time_diff * a
            
            # Cost if we turn off and on the phone
            cost_off_on = b
            
            # Choose the cheaper option
            if cost_on <= cost_off_on:
                current_charge -= cost_on
            else:
                current_charge -= cost_off_on
            
            # Check if we have enough charge to send the message
            if current_charge <= 0:
                print("NO")
                break
        else:
            print("YES")

func()
```

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution is incorrect due to its flawed logic and inability to handle various edge cases properly. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Final: **False**
