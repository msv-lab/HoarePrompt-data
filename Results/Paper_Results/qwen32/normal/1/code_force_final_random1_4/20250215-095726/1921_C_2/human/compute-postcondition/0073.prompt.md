Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ `f`, `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9; the second line contains `n` integers `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n` such that 1 ≤ `m_i` ≤ 10^9 and `m_i` < `m_{i+1}`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    n = feat[0]
    f = feat[1]
    a = feat[2]
    b = feat[-1]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    array2 = []
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
            array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
    if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `array2` is a list containing `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. If the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, then the condition in the if statement is true. Otherwise, the condition in the else statement is true, meaning the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop completes its iterations, `test_cases`, `t`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The variable `array2` accumulates the products `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for all `i` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. If the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, the condition in the if statement holds true. Otherwise, the sum is greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `n-1`, and `array2` contains elements `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. Additionally, if the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, then the condition holds true; otherwise, the sum is greater than or equal to `f`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
