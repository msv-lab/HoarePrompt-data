Postcondition: **After the loop completes its iterations, `test_cases`, `t`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The variable `array2` accumulates the products `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for all `i` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. If the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, the condition in the if statement holds true. Otherwise, the sum is greater than or equal to `f`.**
