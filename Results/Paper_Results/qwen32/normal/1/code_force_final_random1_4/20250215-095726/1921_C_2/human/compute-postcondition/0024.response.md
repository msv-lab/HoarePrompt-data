Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `array2` is a list containing `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. If the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, then the condition in the if statement is true. Otherwise, the condition in the else statement is true, meaning the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.**
