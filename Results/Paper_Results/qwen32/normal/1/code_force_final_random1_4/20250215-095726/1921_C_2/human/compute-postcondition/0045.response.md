Given the initial state described, we know that the `print('Yes')` statement is executed after certain conditions are met within the context of the loop and the subsequent calculations involving `array2`, `arr`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `f`.

The key points from the initial state are:
- `array2` accumulates the products `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for all `i` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.
- The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`.

Since the `print('Yes')` statement is executed, it indicates that the condition leading to this print statement must have been satisfied. Specifically, the condition that the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f` must hold true.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
