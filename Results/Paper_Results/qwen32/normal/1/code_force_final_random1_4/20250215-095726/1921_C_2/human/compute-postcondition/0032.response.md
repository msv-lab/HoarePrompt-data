The given Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `array2`. No other variables are modified or used in this snippet. Therefore, the only change in the state is that `array2` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `array2` is an empty list.**
