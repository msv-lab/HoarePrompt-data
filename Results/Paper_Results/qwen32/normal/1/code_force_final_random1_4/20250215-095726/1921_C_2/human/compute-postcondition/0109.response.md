To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes each test case. The loop iterates `test_cases` times, processing each test case independently. For each test case, it calculates a list `array2` based on the differences between consecutive elements in the input array `arr` and the given constants `a` and `b`. It then checks if the sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`. Based on this condition, it prints either "Yes" or "No".

Since the loop processes each test case independently, the final output state will be a series of "Yes" or "No" responses, one for each test case. The state of the variables `t`, `test_cases`, and any other variables not modified within the loop body will remain unchanged.

Let's summarize the final output state:

Output State: **A series of "Yes" or "No" responses, one for each test case.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, the output will consist of a sequence of "Yes" or "No" answers, each corresponding to whether the condition for the respective test case was met. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, and any other variables not modified within the loop will remain the same as they were initially.
