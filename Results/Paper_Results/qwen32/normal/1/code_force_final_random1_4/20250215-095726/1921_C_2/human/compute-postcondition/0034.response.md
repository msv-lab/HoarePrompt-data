Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `array2` is an empty list. The current value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`.**
