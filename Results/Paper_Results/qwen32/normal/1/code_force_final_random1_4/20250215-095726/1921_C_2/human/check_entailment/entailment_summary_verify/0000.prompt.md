You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

- Program:
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[-1]
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        array2 = []
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
                array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and several parameters. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the differences between consecutive integers in the list and compares this value to a threshold. It prints "Yes" if the calculated value is below the threshold, otherwise it prints "No".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Stepan needs to send `n` messages at specific moments `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`.
- Phone starts with `f` units of charge.
- Phone consumes `a` units of charge per unit of time.
- Turning the phone off and on consumes `b` units of charge.
- Determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case as follows:
1. Reads `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
2. Reads the list of message times `arr`.
3. Iterates through the message times and calculates the energy consumed between consecutive messages if the phone is not turned off and on.
4. If the time difference between two messages is less than `b/a`, it adds the energy consumed during that time to `array2`.
5. It sums up the energy consumed in `array2` and adds `b` for each additional turn-off/turn-on action required.
6. Compares the total energy consumed with `f`. If the total energy is less than `f`, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Turn-off/Turn-on Actions**: The program incorrectly assumes that if the time difference between two messages is less than `b/a`, the phone can stay on without consuming extra energy for turning off and on. However, the problem requires considering the energy cost of turning the phone off and on even if the time difference is small.
2. **Incomplete Energy Calculation**: The program does not account for the energy consumed during the first message and the energy consumed between the last message and the end of the test case.
3. **Logic Flaw**: The program does not handle the scenario where the phone needs to be turned off and on multiple times optimally.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 10 1 2
1 2 3
```
- Initial charge: 10 units.
- Charge consumption per unit time: 1 unit.
- Charge consumption for turn-off/turn-on: 2 units.
- Message times: 1, 2, 3.

The program will calculate the energy consumed as follows:
- Time difference between 1 and 2: 1, which is not less than `b/a` (2), so no energy added to `array2`.
- Time difference between 2 and 3: 1, which is not less than `b/a` (2), so no energy added to `array2`.

Total energy consumed: `0` (from `array2`) + `2 * (n - len(array2))` = `2 * (3 - 0)` = `6`.

Since `6 < 10`, the program will print "Yes". However, the correct answer should be "No" because:
- Sending the first message at time 1 consumes 1 unit of charge, leaving 9 units.
- Turning off and on the phone consumes 2 units, leaving 7 units.
- Sending the second message at time 2 consumes 1 unit of charge, leaving 6 units.
- Turning off and on the phone consumes 2 units, leaving 4 units.
- Sending the third message at time 3 consumes 1 unit of charge, leaving 3 units.
- Turning off and on the phone consumes 2 units, leaving 1 unit.
- Since there are no more messages, the phone can stay off, but the program does not consider the final state correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all edge cases and scenarios correctly. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
