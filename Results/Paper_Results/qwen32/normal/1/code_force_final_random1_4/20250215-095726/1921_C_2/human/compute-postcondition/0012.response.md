Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers read from the input where the first element `n` is greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains the new element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.**
