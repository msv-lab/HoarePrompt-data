The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `test_cases`. If `i` is less than `test_cases`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_end`) which is less than `test_cases` since the loop has just completed an iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`.

Since `test_cases` remains unchanged, we do not need to adjust it.

State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `feat` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `f` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is `i_end + 1`**

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i_end`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `feat` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `f` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**
