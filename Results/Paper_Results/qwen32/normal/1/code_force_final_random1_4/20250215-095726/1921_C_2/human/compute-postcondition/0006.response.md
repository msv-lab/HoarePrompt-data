The code assigns the last element of the list `feat` to the variable `b`. The values of `test_cases`, `t`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `feat` is a list of integers read from the input; `n` is the first element of `feat`; `f` is the second element of `feat`; `a` is the third element of `feat`; `b` is the last element of `feat`.**
