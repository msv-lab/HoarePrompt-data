The code appends a calculated value to the `array2` list. The value appended is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given the conditions, `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` holds true.

Output State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `array2` contains an additional element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**
