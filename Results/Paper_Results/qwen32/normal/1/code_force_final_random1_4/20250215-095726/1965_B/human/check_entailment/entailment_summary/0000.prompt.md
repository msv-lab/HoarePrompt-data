Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function takes a positive integer `rows_number` as input and returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` `rows_number` times. Each element in the list is the output of one call to `func_3()`.

''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing newline characters, decodes it from bytes to a string, and returns the resulting string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` takes no input parameters and returns a list of integers. This list is created by reading a line of input, splitting it by spaces, and converting each resulting substring into an integer.

def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:

            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` takes a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank`. It recursively calculates a value based on the structure of `d` and the state of `processing`. If the list `d[da]` contains only one element, it returns 1. Otherwise, it explores each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed, updates the `processing` list, and computes the minimum value from recursive calls. This minimum value, incremented by 1, is then assigned to `rank[da - 1]` and returned.
Function number 13 :

    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k` where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`. It returns '1\n2' if `n` equals 2 and `k` equals 1. Otherwise, it returns a space-separated string of integers. If `k` equals 1, the returned string is '2 3 4 8 16'. If `k` does not equal 1, the returned string is a sequence of integers that depends on the values of `n` and `k`.
Function number 15 :

''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It determines the number of test cases using `func_10()` and processes each test case using `func_14()`. For each test case, it outputs the result returned by `func_14()` on a new line.
