The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `ans`. None of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`) are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 < k <= n; `b` is the binary string representation of `n`; `l` is the length of `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k`; `ans` is an empty list.**
