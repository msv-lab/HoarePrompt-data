You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to generate a sequence `a` of non-negative integers such that:
1. No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Program Analysis

The main function responsible for generating the sequence is `func_14()`. Let's break down its logic:

1. **Binary Representation**: The function starts by converting `n` and `k` into their binary representations.
2. **Handling Special Case `k = 1`**:
   - If `k = 1` and `n = 2`, it returns `[2]` because the only possible sums are `0` and `2`.
   - Otherwise, it initializes the sequence with `[2, 3]` and continues to add powers of `2` until it reaches the length of the binary representation of `n`.
3. **General Case (`k > 1`)**:
   - It initializes the sequence with powers of `2` up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus one.
   - It then calculates the remaining value needed to avoid `k` and appends `k-1-sum(ans)` to the sequence.
   - It also appends `k+1` and `2*k+1` to ensure that all values up to `n` except `k` can be formed.
   - Finally, it continues appending powers of `2` from the length of the binary representation of `k` to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

### Correctness Check

To verify the correctness, let's consider the provided examples:

1. **Example 1: `n = 2`, `k = 2`**
   - Output: `1\n1`
   - Explanation: The sequence `[1]` allows forming `1` but not `2`.

2. **Example 2: `n = 6`, `k = 1`**
   - Output: `5\n2 3 4 5 6`
   - Explanation: The sequence allows forming all numbers from `2` to `6` but not `1`.

3. **Example 3: `n = 8`, `k = 8`**
   - Output: `7\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Explanation: The sequence allows forming all numbers from `1` to `7` but not `8`.

4. **Example 4: `n = 9`, `k = 3`**
   - Output: `4\n7 1 4 1`
   - Explanation: The sequence allows forming all numbers from `1` to `9` except `3`.

5. **Example 5: `n = 10`, `k = 7`**
   - Output: `4\n1 2 8 3`
   - Explanation: The sequence allows forming all numbers from `1` to `10` except `7`.

### Conclusion

The program seems to handle the special case when `k = 1` and the general case when `k > 1` correctly. It ensures that all required sums can be formed except for `k` itself. Therefore, the program appears to be correct based on the provided examples and the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
