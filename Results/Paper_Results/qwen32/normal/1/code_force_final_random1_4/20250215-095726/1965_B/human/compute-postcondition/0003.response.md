To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and its effect on the existing variables.

Given Code:
```python
sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
```

This line of code calls the function `func_14()`, converts its return value to a string, and writes it to the standard output followed by a newline character.

Since we don't have the definition of `func_14()`, we cannot determine the exact value that will be written to the standard output. However, we know that `num_iterations` remains unchanged.

Let's denote the return value of `func_14()` as `result`. The output state will include this `result` being written to the standard output, and `num_iterations` staying the same.

Output State: **`num_iterations` remains the same; `func_14()` returns a value `result` which is written to the standard output followed by a newline character.**
