In the given for loop, the loop head contains the variable `_` and the function call `func_10()`. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use, and `func_10()` is expected to return the number of iterations the loop should perform.

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to focus on the return value of `func_10()`. If `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `func_10()` returns a positive integer.

Since we cannot directly control the behavior of `func_10()` as it is not defined in the provided code snippet, we can only assume its return value. For the loop to execute, we need to assume that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0**
