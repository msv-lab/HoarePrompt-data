Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a new list of integers with at least one element; `b` is a new list of integers with at least one element and `b[0]` equals `a[0]`; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` which is `a[0]`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` which is `a[0]`; `i` is 1**.

In natural language, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
