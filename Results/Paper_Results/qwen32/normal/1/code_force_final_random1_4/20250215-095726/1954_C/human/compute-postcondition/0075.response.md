Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a new list of integers; `b` is a new list of integers; `new` is a list where the first `k` elements are the values of `a` (or `b`), and if `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, the `i`-th element is now `min(a[i], b[i])` for `i` from `k + 1` to `len(a) - 1`, with the rest being `None`; `new2` is a list where the first `k` elements are the values of `a` (or `b`), and if `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, the `i`-th element is now `max(a[i], b[i])` for `i` from `k + 1` to `len(a) - 1`, with the rest being `None`; `i` is `len(a)` if `i` was not initially equal to `len(a)`, otherwise `i` remains `k`.**
