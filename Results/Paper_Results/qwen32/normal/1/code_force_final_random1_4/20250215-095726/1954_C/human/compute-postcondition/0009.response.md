The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so now `i` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a non-empty list of integers; `b` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` or longer, where `a[0] == b[0]`; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` is `a[0]`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` is `a[0]`; `i` is 1**.
