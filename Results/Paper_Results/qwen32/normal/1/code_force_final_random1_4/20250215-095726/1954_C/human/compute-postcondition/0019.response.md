Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` or longer; `new` is a list where `new[j] = a[j]` for all `j < i` and `new[j] = None` for all `j >= i`; `new2` is a list where `new2[j] = a[j]` for all `j < i` and `new2[j] = None` for all `j >= i`; `i` is the smallest index such that `a[i] != b[i]`. Since `i != len(a)`, there exists at least one index `i` where `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`.**
