The value of `i` is incremented by 1. This means that `i` now points to the next index in the lists `a` and `b`. The lists `new` and `new2` remain unchanged because the code only increments `i` and does not modify `new` or `new2` directly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` or longer; `new` is a list where `new[j] = a[j]` for all `j < i` and `new[j] = None` for all `j > i+1`, and `new[i-1] = min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, `new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])`; `new2` is a list where `new2[j] = a[j]` for all `j < i` and `new2[j] = None` for all `j >= i+1`, except `new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])` and `new2[i-1] = max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`; `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `len(a)`**.
