Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` or longer; if `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, then `new` is a list where `new[j] = min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j < len(a)` and `new[j] = None` for all `j ≥ len(a)`, and `new2` is a list where `new2[j] = max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j < len(a)` and `new2[j] = None` for all `j ≥ len(a)`. Otherwise, `new` and `new2` remain unchanged with `new[j] = a[j]` and `new2[j] = a[j]` for all `j < i` and `new[j] = new2[j] = None` for all `j ≥ i`. `i` is the smallest index such that `a[i] != b[i]` or `i == len(a)` if all elements match.**
