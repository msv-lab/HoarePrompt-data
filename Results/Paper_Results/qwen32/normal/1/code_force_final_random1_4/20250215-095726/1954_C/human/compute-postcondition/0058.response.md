Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a new list of integers; `b` is a new list of integers; `new` is a list where the first `k` elements are the values of `a` (or `b`) and the rest are `None`; `new2` is a list where the first `k` elements are the values of `a` (or `b`) and the rest are `None`; `i` is `k`, where `k` is the smallest index such that `a[k] != b[k]` or `k` is the length of `a`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, meaning there exists at least one index `k` where `a[k]` is not equal to `b[k]`.**
