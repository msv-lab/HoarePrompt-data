Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `b` is a list of integers derived from the current input line; `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`; `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`; `i` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been set to 0. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `new`, `new2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
