To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop, which is `i < len(a)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `b` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` or longer.
- `new` is a list where `new[j] = a[j]` for all `j < i+1` and `new[j] = None` for all `j > i+1`, and `new[i+1] = min(a[i+1], b[i+1])`.
- `new2` is a list where `new2[j] = a[j]` for all `j < i+1` and `new2[j] = None` for all `j >= i+1`, except `new2[i+1] = max(a[i+1], b[i+1])`.
- `i` is the smallest index such that `a[i+1] != b[i+1]` and `i+1` must be less than `len(a) - 1`.

The loop condition is `i < len(a)`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. Given that `i` is already defined as the smallest index such that `a[i+1] != b[i+1]` and `i+1` must be less than `len(a) - 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `len(a)`.

Since `i` is defined in such a way that `i+1` is less than `len(a) - 1`, it follows that `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, ensuring that `i` remains less than `len(a)`.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` or longer; `new` is a list where `new[j] = a[j]` for all `j < i+1` and `new[j] = None` for all `j > i+1`, and `new[i+1] = min(a[i+1], b[i+1])`; `new2` is a list where `new2[j] = a[j]` for all `j < i+1` and `new2[j] = None` for all `j >= i+1`, except `new2[i+1] = max(a[i+1], b[i+1])`; `i` is incremented by 1**
