The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was initially defined as the smallest index where `a[i] != b[i]` plus two, after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` will now be the smallest index where `a[i] != b[i]` plus three.

All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `new`, `new2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers where `b` differs from `a` at at least one index; `new` is a list of integers where `new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])`; `new2` is a list of integers where `new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])` for the specific index `i` and `new2[j] = min(a[j], b[j])` for all other indices `j`; `i` is the smallest index where `a[i] != b[i]` plus three and `i < len(a)`**.
