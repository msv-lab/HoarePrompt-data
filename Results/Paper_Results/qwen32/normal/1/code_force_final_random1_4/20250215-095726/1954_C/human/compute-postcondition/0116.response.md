To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the logic used to construct the `new2` list.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (This seems to be a constraint on the number of test cases or iterations but does not directly affect the current lists `a` and `b`).
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers.
- `new` and `new2` are lists constructed based on the comparison between `a` and `b`.

### Construction of `new2`:
- For each index `j` in the lists `a` and `b`:
  - If `a[j] == b[j]`, then `new2[j] = min(a[j], b[j])` (which is just `a[j]` or `b[j]` since they are equal).
  - If `a[j] != b[j]`, then `new2[j] = max(a[j], b[j])` for all subsequent indices until the end of the lists.

### Key Points:
- The construction of `new2` depends on the first index where `a[j] != b[j]`.
- If `a` and `b` are identical, `new2` will be identical to `a` and `b`.
- If there is a difference, `new2` will have the maximum values from the point of difference onward.

### Example Scenario:
Let's consider an example to illustrate this:
- Suppose `a = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `b = [1, 2, 5, 4]`.
- At index 2, `a[2] != b[2]` (3 != 5).
- Therefore, `new2` will be `[1, 2, max(3, 5), max(4, 4)]` which simplifies to `[1, 2, 5, 4]`.

### General Case:
Given the general nature of the problem, without specific values for `a` and `b`, we can describe the output as follows:
- If `a` and `b` are identical, `new2` will be identical to `a` and `b`.
- If `a` and `b` differ at some index `i`, `new2` will be the same as `a` and `b` up to index `i-1`, and from index `i` onward, it will contain the maximum values of `a` and `b`.

### Final Output Description:
The `print` statement will output the string representation of the `new2` list, which is constructed based on the rules described above.

Output: **new2 (where new2 is a list of integers constructed such that for each index j, new2[j] = min(a[j], b[j]) if a[j] == b[j], and new2[j] = max(a[j], b[j]) for all j starting from the smallest index where a[j] != b[j] up to len(a) - 1)**
