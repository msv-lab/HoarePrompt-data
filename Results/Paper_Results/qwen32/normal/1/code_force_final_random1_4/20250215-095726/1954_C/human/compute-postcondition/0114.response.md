Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `new` is a list of integers where `new[j] = max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` where `a[j] == b[j]` and `min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` starting from the smallest index where `a[j] != b[j]` up to `len(a) - 1`; `new2` is a list of integers where `new2[j] = min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` where `a[j] == b[j]` and `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` starting from the smallest index where `a[j] != b[j]` up to `len(a) - 1`; `i` is equal to `len(a)` if `a` and `b` differ at any index, otherwise `i` remains the smallest index where `a[i] != b[i]` or `len(a)` if all elements are equal.**
