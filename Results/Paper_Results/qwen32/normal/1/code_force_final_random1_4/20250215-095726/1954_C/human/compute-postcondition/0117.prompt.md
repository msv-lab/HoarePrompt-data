Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, x and y are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and they have the same length. Additionally, 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, list(input())))
    b = list(map(int, list(input())))
    new = [None] * len(a)
    new2 = [None] * len(a)
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
    if i != len(a):
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
        while i < len(a):
            new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` or longer; if `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, then `new` is a list where `new[j] = min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j < len(a)` and `new[j] = None` for all `j ≥ len(a)`, and `new2` is a list where `new2[j] = max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j < len(a)` and `new2[j] = None` for all `j ≥ len(a)`. Otherwise, `new` and `new2` remain unchanged with `new[j] = a[j]` and `new2[j] = a[j]` for all `j < i` and `new[j] = new2[j] = None` for all `j ≥ i`. `i` is the smallest index such that `a[i] != b[i]` or `i == len(a)` if all elements match.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a new list of integers; `b` is a new list of integers; `new` is a list where the first `k` elements are the values of `a` (or `b`), and if `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, the `i`-th element is now `min(a[i], b[i])` for `i` from `k + 1` to `len(a) - 1`, with the rest being `None`; `new2` is a list where the first `k` elements are the values of `a` (or `b`), and if `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, the `i`-th element is now `max(a[i], b[i])` for `i` from `k + 1` to `len(a) - 1`, with the rest being `None`; `i` is `len(a)` if `i` was not initially equal to `len(a)`, otherwise `i` remains `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `new` is a list of integers where `new[j] = max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` where `a[j] == b[j]` and `min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` starting from the smallest index where `a[j] != b[j]` up to `len(a) - 1`; `new2` is a list of integers where `new2[j] = min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` where `a[j] == b[j]` and `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` starting from the smallest index where `a[j] != b[j]` up to `len(a) - 1`; `i` is equal to `len(a)` if `a` and `b` differ at any index, otherwise `i` remains the smallest index where `a[i] != b[i]` or `len(a)` if all elements are equal.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
