Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the problem description. The main issue lies in how the `func_1` function handles the replacement of characters.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**: The code attempts to replace each character in the encoded string `s` with its corresponding symmetric character from the sorted unique characters list `unique_chars`. However, it uses the `replace` method, which replaces all occurrences of a character in the string, not just the current one being processed. This leads to incorrect results because it changes characters that should remain unchanged.

2. **Logic for Symmetric Character Replacement**: The code incorrectly modifies the `unique_chars` list during the replacement process, which affects the symmetry mapping. Specifically, it inserts characters into `unique_chars` when they are not found, which is not part of the intended logic for decoding.

3. **Order of Operations**: The code does not maintain the correct order of operations for decoding. It should map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart in the `unique_chars` list without altering the list during the process.

Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    reverse_mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(reverse_mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

This corrected version creates a dictionary `reverse_mapping` that maps each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric counterpart. It then constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string `s` with its mapped value.

Given these issues, the original code does not correctly decode the encoded string for every potential case, making it incorrect.
