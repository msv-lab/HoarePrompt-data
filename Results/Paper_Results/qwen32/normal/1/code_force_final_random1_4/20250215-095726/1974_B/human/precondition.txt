The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), representing the length of the encoded string b. The second line contains the encoded string b, which consists of n lowercase Latin letters. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
