Postcondition: **`s` is a list of strings, and `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found across all strings in `s`. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, each occurrence of `char` in `s` has been replaced with `unique_chars[j]`, `i` is 0, and `j` is len(unique_chars) - 2. Otherwise, `char` is inserted at the beginning of `unique_chars`, `i` is 1, and `j` is len(unique_chars).**
