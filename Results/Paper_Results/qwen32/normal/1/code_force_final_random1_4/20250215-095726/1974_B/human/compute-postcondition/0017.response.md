Postcondition: **`s` is a list of strings, and `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters found across all strings in `s`. If `char` was already in `unique_chars`, each occurrence of `char` in `s` has been replaced with `unique_chars[j]` and `j` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `char` is inserted into `unique_chars` at index `i`, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is increased by 1. `char` remains the next element in `s`.**
