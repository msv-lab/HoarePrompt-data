Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. The main issue lies in the `func_1` function, which attempts to replace characters in `s` with their corresponding characters from the reversed list of unique characters but does so incorrectly. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**: The program uses `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` inside the loop. This replaces all occurrences of `char` in the entire string `s` at once, which is not the intended behavior. Instead, it should replace only the current occurrence of `char`.

2. **Logic for Inserting Characters**: The logic for inserting characters into `unique_chars` when they are not found is incorrect. The program tries to insert characters into `unique_chars` when they are not found, which is unnecessary because `unique_chars` should only contain distinct characters from the original string `s`.

3. **Building the Decoded String**: The program does not build the decoded string correctly. It should map each character in `b` to its corresponding character in the reversed `unique_chars` list and construct the decoded string accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))  # Get unique characters and sort them
    reverse_unique_chars = unique_chars[::-1]  # Reverse the sorted unique characters
    mapping = {encoded: original for encoded, original in zip(unique_chars, reverse_unique_chars)}  # Create a mapping dictionary
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)  # Decode the string using the mapping
    return decoded_str
```

With this corrected function, the program should work as expected.
