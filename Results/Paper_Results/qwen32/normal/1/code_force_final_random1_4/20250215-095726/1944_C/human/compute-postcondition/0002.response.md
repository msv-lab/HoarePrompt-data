The code snippet initializes a new set named `vis`. This does not affect the existing variables `arr`, `nums`, or `start`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the new set `vis`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`; `nums` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr`; `start` is 0; `vis` is an empty set.**
