To determine what will be printed when the `print(start)` statement executes, let's analyze the initial state provided:

1. `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`.
2. `nums` is a `Counter` object representing the counts of each element in `arr` with the counts of processed elements decremented accordingly.
3. `start` is the first index that does not have any remaining elements to process.
4. `vis` is a set containing all indices from `0` to `start - 1`.

Given this information, `start` is defined as the first index in `arr` that has no remaining elements to process. This means that all elements from index `0` to `start - 1` have been processed, and their counts in the `nums` `Counter` object have been decremented to zero.

Since `vis` contains all indices from `0` to `start - 1`, it indicates that these indices have been visited and processed. Therefore, `start` is the smallest index that has not been visited or processed yet.

However, without specific values for `arr`, `nums`, and the processing logic, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `start`. We only know that `start` is the first index that has not been processed.

Thus, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **start (where start is the first index in arr that has not been processed)**
