The given code snippet creates a `Counter` object from the list `arr`. This `Counter` object, named `nums`, will count the occurrences of each element in the list `arr`.

Given the initial state, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. After executing the line `nums = c.Counter(arr)`, `nums` will be a dictionary-like object where keys are the unique elements from `arr` and values are their respective counts.

Since the initial state specifies the properties of `arr` but does not provide its specific contents, we cannot determine the exact counts of each element. However, we know that `nums` will contain these counts.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`; `nums` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr`.**
