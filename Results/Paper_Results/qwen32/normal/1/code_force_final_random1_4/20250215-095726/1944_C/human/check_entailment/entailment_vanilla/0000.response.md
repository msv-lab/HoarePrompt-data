Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Key Points:
- Alice starts first.
- Both players play optimally.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- We need to find the final MEX of `c` after the game ends.

### Optimal Strategy:
- Alice will try to add elements to `c` in such a way that the MEX is maximized.
- Bob will try to prevent this by removing elements that could help Alice increase the MEX.

### Observations:
- If there are pairs of consecutive numbers (e.g., 0 and 1, 1 and 2), Alice can ensure that these pairs are added to `c` alternately with Bob's moves.
- If there are no pairs of consecutive numbers, the MEX will be the smallest number that is missing from the array.

### Provided Code Analysis:
The code reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and an array `a` of size `n`.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size `n` and the array `a`.
3. It calls the function `func_1(arr)` to determine the MEX of the final array `c`.

The function `func_1(arr)`:
1. Uses `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
2. Initializes `start` to 0 and an empty set `vis` to keep track of visited elements.
3. Iterates through the elements, decrementing their counts in `nums` and updating `start` if the next consecutive number is available.
4. Prints the smallest number that is not present in `c` after the loop.

### Correctness Check:
- The code correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c` after the game ends.
- It handles the scenario where there are pairs of consecutive numbers and ensures that Alice can maximize the MEX by alternating with Bob.
- It also handles the scenario where there are no pairs of consecutive numbers and correctly identifies the smallest missing number.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the final array `c` after the game ends, considering the optimal strategies of both players.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
