To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `nums.get(start, 0)`. The loop will continue as long as `nums[start]` is greater than 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`.
- `nums` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr` with the count of the element at index 0 decreased by 1, and the count of the element at index 1 decreased by 1.
- If `nums[start + 1]` is greater than 0, then `nums[start + 1]` is decreased by 1, `start` is updated to 2, and `vis` remains `{0, 1}`. Otherwise, the program returns nothing.

The loop condition is `while nums.get(start, 0):`, which means the loop will continue if `nums[start]` is greater than 0.

From the problem description, after the first iteration:
- `start` is updated to 2.
- `nums[start + 1]` (which is `nums[3]`) is decreased by 1, assuming it was greater than 0 initially.

For the loop to execute one more time, `nums[start]` (which is now `nums[2]`) must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `nums[2]` is greater than 0.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr` with the count of the element at index 0 decreased by 1, the count of the element at index 1 decreased by 1, and the count of the element at index 2 is greater than 0. `start` is 2, and `vis` remains `{0, 1}`.**
