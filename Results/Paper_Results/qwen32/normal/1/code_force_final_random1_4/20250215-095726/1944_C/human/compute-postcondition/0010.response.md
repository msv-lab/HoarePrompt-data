Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`arr`**: A list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. This means every element in `arr` is a valid index within the bounds of `arr`.

2. **`nums`**: A `Counter` object representing the counts of each element in `arr`. The count of the element at index 0 in `arr` is decreased by 1 in this `Counter` object. This means if `arr[0]` appears `k` times in `arr`, it will appear `k-1` times in `nums`.

3. **`start`**: Initialized to 0. This variable is used as an index into the `arr` list.

4. **`vis`**: A set initialized with the single element `{0}`, indicating that the element at index 0 of `arr` has been visited.

5. **Count of `arr[start + 1]` in `nums`**: Given as 0. Since `start` is 0, this means the count of `arr[1]` in `nums` is 0.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:

The print statement is:
```python
print(start + 1)
```

Given that `start` is initialized to 0, the expression `start + 1` evaluates to `0 + 1`, which is `1`.

### Conclusion:

The print statement will output the value of `start + 1`, which is `1`.

Output: **1**
