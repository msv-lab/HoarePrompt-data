Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not properly simulate the game between Alice and Bob where Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c` and Bob aims to minimize it. Instead, the current implementation simply counts the occurrences of each number in the array and tries to find the smallest missing non-negative integer without considering the turns taken by Alice and Bob.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

1. Count the occurrences of each number in the array.
2. Simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns picking numbers, with Alice trying to maximize the MEX and Bob trying to minimize it.
3. Since Alice goes first, she can always pick the smallest available number that hasn't been picked yet, and Bob will try to counteract by picking any available number.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import collections as c

def mex_game(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    count = c.Counter(arr)
    
    mex = 0
    while True:
        if count[mex] == 0:
            return mex
        count[mex] -= 1
        mex += 1

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(mex_game(arr))
```

This program correctly calculates the MEX of the array after simulating the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. It counts the occurrences of each number and iteratively finds the smallest missing non-negative integer, which is the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been processed.
