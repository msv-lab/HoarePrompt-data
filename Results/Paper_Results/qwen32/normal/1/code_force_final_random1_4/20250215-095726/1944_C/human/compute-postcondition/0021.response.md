Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr` with the count of the element at index 0 decreased by 1, the count of the element at index 1 decreased by 1, and the count of the element at index 2 is greater than 0. `start` is 2, and `vis` is `{0, 1, 2}`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The set `vis` now includes the value `2` in addition to the previously existing values `0` and `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
