Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`arr`**: A list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`.
2. **`nums`**: A `Counter` object representing the counts of each element in `arr` with the following modifications:
   - The count of the element at index 0 in `arr` is decreased by 1.
   - The count of the element at index 1 in `arr` is decreased by 1.
   - The count of the element at index 2 in `arr` is greater than 0 and now decreased by 1.
3. **`start`**: This variable is explicitly set to 2.
4. **`vis`**: A set containing the elements `{0, 1, 2}`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(start + 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `start` is explicitly set to 2.
- The expression `start + 1` simply adds 1 to the value of `start`.

### Calculation:
- `start` = 2
- `start + 1` = 2 + 1 = 3

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the result of `start + 1`, which is 3.

### Final Output:
Output: **3**
