The code snippet `nums[start] -= 1` decrements the count of the element at index `start` (which is 0) in the `nums` Counter object by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`.
- `nums` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr`.
- `start` is 0.
- `vis` is {0}.

After executing `nums[start] -= 1`, the count of the element at index 0 in `arr` is decreased by 1 in the `nums` Counter object. The values of `arr`, `start`, and `vis` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`; `nums` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr` with the count of the element at index 0 decreased by 1; `start` is 0; `vis` is {0}.**
