Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob to play the game and determine the MEX of the final array `c`. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Strategy Implementation**: The code does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob. Instead, it directly calculates the MEX based on the frequency of elements in the array. This approach does not consider the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob during the game.

2. **Lack of Turn Simulation**: The game involves alternating turns between Alice and Bob. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The current code does not simulate these turns and their respective strategies.

3. **Incorrect MEX Calculation Logic**: The code attempts to calculate the MEX by iterating through the numbers starting from 0 and checking their presence in the array. However, it does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob's actions affect the composition of the array `c` differently.

To illustrate the issue, let's consider a test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- Alice and Bob will take turns picking elements from the array.
- Alice can pick 0, then Bob picks 1, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 3, and Alice picks 4.
- The final array `c` will be `[0, 2, 4]`, and the MEX of this array is 1.

However, the provided code will output `5` for this test case because it simply finds the first missing number in the sequence without simulating the game.

Given these points, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
