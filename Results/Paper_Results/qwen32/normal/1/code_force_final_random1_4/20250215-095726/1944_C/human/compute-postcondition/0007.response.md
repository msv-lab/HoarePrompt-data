The code snippet `nums[start + 1] -= 1` decreases the count of the element at index `start + 1` in the `Counter` object `nums` by 1. Given that `start` is 0, this means the count of the element at index 1 in `nums` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr` with the count of the element at index 0 decreased by 1 and the count of the element at index 1 further decreased by 1. `start` is 0. `vis` is {0}.**

In simpler terms, the count of the element at index 1 in `nums` has been reduced by 1, while all other conditions remain the same.
