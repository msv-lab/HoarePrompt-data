The value of `start` is incremented by 1. Initially, `start` was 2, so now `start` is 3. The other variables (`arr`, `nums`, and `vis`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr` with the count of the element at index 0 decreased by 1, the count of the element at index 1 decreased by 1, the count of the element at index 2 decreased by 1, and the count of the element at index 3 decreased by 1. `start` is 3, and `vis` is `{0, 1, 2}`.**
