You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing up to `y` additional vertices from a regular `n`-sided polygon, given `x` vertices already chosen by Bessie.

### Key Points

1. **Vertices and Diagonals**: We need to form triangles using the chosen vertices and additional vertices.
2. **Non-intersecting Diagonals**: Diagonals should not intersect within the polygon.
3. **Maximize Triangles**: The objective is to maximize the number of triangles formed by these diagonals.

### Approach

The program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Sorting the initially chosen vertices.
2. Calculating the gaps between consecutive vertices.
3. Adding additional vertices to fill these gaps to form triangles.
4. Handling the gap between the last and the first vertex separately.
5. Finally, adding any remaining vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

### Detailed Reasoning

1. **Sorting Vertices**: The program sorts the list of vertices to easily calculate gaps between them.
2. **Gap Calculation**: It calculates the gaps between consecutive vertices and checks if these gaps can be filled with additional vertices to form triangles.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program also handles the gap between the last and the first vertex to ensure all possible triangles are considered.
4. **Adding Remaining Vertices**: If there are still additional vertices left after filling the gaps, they are added to maximize the number of triangles.
5. **Limiting the Number of Triangles**: The program ensures that the number of triangles does not exceed `n-2`, which is the maximum number of triangles that can be formed in an `n`-sided polygon.

### Issues in the Program

Upon closer inspection, the program has a few issues:
1. **Incorrect Indexing in Gap Calculation**: The program uses `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to calculate gaps, but when handling the gap between the last and first vertex, it incorrectly uses `a[i] - a[i - 1]` again instead of `a[0] + n - a[-1]`.
2. **Incorrect Condition for Adding Vertices**: The condition `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is used to check if additional vertices can be added, but this logic seems flawed as it does not correctly account for the number of vertices needed to fill the gap.
3. **Final Addition of Vertices**: The final addition of vertices (`ans += y`) is incorrect because it does not consider whether these vertices can actually form additional triangles without violating the non-intersecting condition.

### Conclusion

Given the identified issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
