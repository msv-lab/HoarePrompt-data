Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`. Additionally, the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [(num - 1) for num in a]
    ans = x - 2
    st = set(a)
    a.sort()
    for i in range(x):
        t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
        t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
        if t1 not in st and t2 in st:
            ans += 1
    odd = []
    even = []
    for i in range(x):
        next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
        gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
        if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
            odd.append(gap)
        elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
            even.append(gap)
    odd.sort()
    even.sort()
    for gap in odd:
        if y < gap // 2:
            ans += 2 * y
            y = 0
            break
        ans += gap
        y -= gap // 2
    for gap in even:
        if y < gap // 2:
            ans += 2 * y
            y = 0
            break
        ans += gap
        y -= gap // 2
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `2x - 2` remains unchanged, `odd` remains unchanged, `even` remains unchanged, `ans` is the sum of all `gap` values added during the iterations (plus `2 * y` if the break condition was met), and `y` is either 0 or the remaining value after all reductions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: 2x - 2 remains unchanged, odd is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, even is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even, n remains the first value provided in the input, x remains the second value provided in the input, t is decremented by x, a remains a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list a, st remains a set containing unique elements from the modified list a, ans is x - 2 + k + (sum of all gaps in odd) + (sum of all gaps in even), y is y - (sum of (gap // 2) for all gaps in even).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: 2x - 2 remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, x remains unchanged, t remains unchanged, a remains unchanged, st remains unchanged, odd remains unchanged, i remains unchanged, y is 0, ans is the sum of all gap values processed plus 2 * y before breaking.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
