Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is initially set to `len(a)`, `ans` is calculated as `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list, `y` is updated based on decrement operations, `ii` is incremented by 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, and `a[i] - a[i - 1] is not equal to 2`. Additionally, `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.**
