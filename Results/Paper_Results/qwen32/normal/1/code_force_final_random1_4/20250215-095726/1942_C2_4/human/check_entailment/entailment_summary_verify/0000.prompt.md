You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    for ii in range(tt):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, along with a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given inputs, representing a computed result that is adjusted by the value of `y` and constrained to be no greater than `n - 2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Objective**: Maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing up to `y` additional vertices from a regular polygon with `n` sides.
2. **Constraints**:
   - `4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`
   - `2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)`
   - `0 ≤ y ≤ n - x`
3. **Inputs**:
   - Number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
4. **Outputs**:
   - For each test case, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Program Analysis
The program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Sorting the vertices Bessie has chosen.
2. Calculating the initial number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices.
3. Iterating through the sorted list of vertices to check gaps between consecutive vertices and adding additional vertices if possible to maximize the number of triangles.
4. Handling the gap between the last and the first vertex separately.
5. Adding any remaining vertices (`y`) to the count of triangles.
6. Printing the minimum of the calculated number of triangles and `n - 2` (since the maximum number of triangles in a polygon with `n` sides is `n - 2`).

### Potential Issues
1. **Handling Gaps**:
   - The program checks if the gap between consecutive vertices is exactly 2 and adds 1 triangle.
   - If the gap is even and greater than 2, it calculates how many additional vertices can be added to fill the gap and increases the triangle count accordingly.
   - However, the condition `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` seems incorrect. It should be `y >= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` to ensure we do not use more vertices than allowed.
2. **Circular Gap Handling**:
   - The program incorrectly uses `a[i] - a[i - 1]` instead of `a[0] + n - a[-1]` in the circular gap calculation.
3. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The final adjustment `ans += y` seems incorrect. It should only add the remaining vertices if they can form additional triangles without violating constraints.

### Test Case to Demonstrate Issue
Consider the following test case:
```
1
6 2 2
1 4
```
- Expected Output: `4` (We can form 4 triangles by choosing vertices 2 and 5).
- Program Output: `5` (Incorrect due to improper handling of gaps and circular gaps).

### Conclusion
The program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly in the way it calculates and uses the additional vertices (`y`). Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation of Why Incorrect
The program incorrectly handles the conditions for adding vertices to form triangles, especially in the circular gap calculation and the final adjustment of the triangle count. This leads to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
