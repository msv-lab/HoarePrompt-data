Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tt` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is equal to `len(a)`; `ans` is updated based on the loop conditions; `tmp` contains valid `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` values; `y` is updated based on the loop conditions; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input with `y` modified within the loop. Additionally, `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2. The expression `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2` equals 0 and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.**
