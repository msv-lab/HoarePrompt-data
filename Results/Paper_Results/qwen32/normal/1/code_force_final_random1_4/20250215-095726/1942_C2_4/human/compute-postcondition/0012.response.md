The code appends the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given the initial state, `tmp` was initially an empty list. After executing the line of code, `tmp` now contains one element, which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.

The other variables (`t`, `tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input with at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is a list containing the single element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2. Additionally, `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.**
