Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input with at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list, and the current element `a[i]` minus the previous element `a[i - 1]` equals 2.**
