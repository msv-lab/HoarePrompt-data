The given Python code snippet simply reinitializes the list `tmp` to an empty list. This operation does not affect any other variables or their values.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `a` is the newly input sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is calculated as `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list, `y` is updated based on the decrement operations, `ii` is incremented by 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input.**
