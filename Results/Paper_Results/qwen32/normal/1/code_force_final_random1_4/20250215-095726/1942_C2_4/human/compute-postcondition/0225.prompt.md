Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `2x - 2` remains unchanged, `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even, `n` is the first value provided in the input, `x` is the second value provided in the input, `y` is the third value provided in the input, `t` is `t + x`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, each decreased by 1, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the modified list `a`, `ans` is `x - 2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
    t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
    if t1 not in st and t2 in st:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `2x - 2` remains unchanged, `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even, `n` is the first value provided in the input, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is the third value provided in the input, `t` is `t + x`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, each decreased by 1, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the modified list `a`, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`. If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is `x - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `2x - 2` remains unchanged, `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even, `n` is the first value provided in the input, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is the third value provided in the input, `t` is `t + x`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, each decreased by 1, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the modified list `a`, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `2x - 2` remains unchanged, `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even, `n` is the first value provided in the input, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is the third value provided in the input, `t` is `t + x`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, each decreased by 1, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the modified list `a`, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
