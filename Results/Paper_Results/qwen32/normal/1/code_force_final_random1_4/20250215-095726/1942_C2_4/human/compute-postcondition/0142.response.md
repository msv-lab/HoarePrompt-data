The code snippet `sx += y * 2` updates the value of `sx` by adding `y * 2` to its current value. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the value of `sx`. Since the initial value of `sx` is not specified, we can only describe its new value in terms of its previous value and the expression `y * 2`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `y` is `y - c`, `R` is defined as a lambda function that maps input split by spaces to integers, `l` is a list of integers read from the input and split by spaces, now sorted in ascending order with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is a list containing the value of `c` for each iteration from 1 to `x`, sorted such that all even numbers come before odd numbers and within each group, the numbers are sorted in ascending order, `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and the original value of `cons`, `c` is `(val[k+1]) // 2`, `i` is `val[k+1]`, `sx` is updated to `sx + y * 2`.**
