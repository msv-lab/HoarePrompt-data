Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. `R` is defined as a lambda function that maps input split by spaces to integers.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, x, y = R()
    sx = 0
    l = list(R())
    l.sort()
    l.append(n + l[0])
    val = []
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
        if c == 1:
            sx += 1
        val.append(c)
    val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
    for i in val:
        c = i // 2
        if y < c:
            sx += y * 2
            break
        sx += i
        y -= c
    cons = x + sx - 2
    cons = min(n - 2, cons)
    print(cons)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\); `n` is the first integer read from the input; `x` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1; `y` is the third integer read from the input minus 9; `R` is defined as a lambda function that maps input split by spaces to integers; `l` is a list of integers read from the input and sorted in ascending order with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to the end; `val` is a list containing `x` values of `c`, sorted first by evenness (even numbers first) and then by value; `sx` is the count of `c` values that were equal to 1 plus 18; `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and its previous value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer read from the input; `x` is the second integer read from the input; `y` is the third integer read from the input minus the sum of `i // 2` for all `i` in `val`; `R` is defined as a lambda function that maps input split by spaces to integers; `l` is a list of integers read from the input and split by spaces, sorted in ascending order, with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended; `val` is a list containing `x` elements where each element is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `x`, sorted first by evenness (even numbers before odd numbers) and then by value; `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val`; `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and the original value of `cons`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is the second integer read from the input, `y` is `y - sum(i // 2 for i in val)`, `R` is defined as a lambda function that maps input split by spaces to integers, `l` is a list of integers read from the input and split by spaces, now sorted in ascending order with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is a list containing the value of `c` for each iteration from 1 to `x`, sorted such that all even numbers come before odd numbers and within each group, the numbers are sorted in ascending order, `sx` is `sx + sum(val)`, `cons` is `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
