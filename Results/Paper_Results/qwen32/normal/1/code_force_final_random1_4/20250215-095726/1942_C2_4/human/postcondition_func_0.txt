The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, along with a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given inputs, representing a computed result that is adjusted by the value of `y` and constrained to be no greater than `n - 2`.
