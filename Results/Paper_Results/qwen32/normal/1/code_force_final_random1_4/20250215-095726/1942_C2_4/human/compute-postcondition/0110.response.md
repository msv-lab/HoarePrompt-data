The code snippet appends the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `tt`, `a`, `i`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `ans`, or `ii`. The only change is that `tmp` now includes an additional element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tt` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 1; `i` is 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input; `ans` is unchanged; `tmp` contains an additional element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`; `ii` is unchanged.**
