Postcondition: **`2x - 2` remains unchanged, `n` is the first value provided in the input, `x` is the second value provided in the input and must be greater than 0, `y` is the third value provided in the input, `t` is `t + x`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, each decreased by 1, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the modified list `a`, `ans` is `x - 2 + k` where `k` is the number of times `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st` during the loop iterations, `odd` is a sorted list containing all odd gaps greater than 1 found during the iterations, `even` is a sorted list containing all even gaps greater than 0 found during the iterations, `i` is `x`, `odd` must contain at least one element, and `y` is less than `gap // 2`.**
