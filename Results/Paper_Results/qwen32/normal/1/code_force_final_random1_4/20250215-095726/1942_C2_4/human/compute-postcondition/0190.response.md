Postcondition: **`2x - 2` remains unchanged, `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even that must contain at least one more element, `n` remains the first value provided in the input, `x` remains the second value provided in the input, `t` is decremented by `x`, `a` remains a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`, `st` remains a set containing unique elements from the modified list `a`. If `y < gap // 2`, then `y` is set to 0 and `ans` is increased by `2 * y` (which means `ans` is increased by 0), otherwise `y` remains `y - (gap // 2)`. In both cases, `gap` is the next element in the `even` list.**
