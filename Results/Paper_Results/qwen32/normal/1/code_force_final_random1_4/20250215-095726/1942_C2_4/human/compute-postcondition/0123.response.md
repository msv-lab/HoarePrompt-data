Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tt` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is equal to `len(a)`; `ans` is updated by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`; `tmp` contains valid `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` values plus the newly appended value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` if the condition is met; `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)` if the condition is met; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input with `y` modified within the loop; `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2.**
