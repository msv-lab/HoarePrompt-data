You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i] and y[i] represent the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] represents the radius of the i-th disk such that -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9. visited and coef are lists of length n initialized with None, and tot and bipartite are variables used within the function.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` is the integer input provided (between 1 and 1000); `x` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `y` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `r` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `tot` and `bipartite` are variables used within the function; `i` is `n`.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: `n` is the integer input provided (between 1 and 1000), `x` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `y` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `r` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `visited` is a list of boolean values where each element is `True` if the corresponding node was visited during the DFS traversals, `coef` is a list of integers where each element is either `1` or `-1` indicating the bipartition of the graph, `tot` is the sum of the `r` values for nodes in one of the partitions, `bipartite` is `True` if the graph is bipartite and `False` otherwise, `i` is `n` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), and `ok` is `True` if there exists at least one bipartite component with a non-zero total `r` value, otherwise `False`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `n` is the integer input provided (between 1 and 1000), `x` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `y` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `r` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `visited` is a list of boolean values where each element is `True` if the corresponding node was visited during the DFS traversals, `coef` is a list of integers where each element is either `1` or `-1` indicating the bipartition of the graph, `tot` is the sum of the `r` values for nodes in one of the partitions, `bipartite` is `True` if the graph is bipartite and `False` otherwise, `i` is `n` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations). If `ok` is `True`, there exists at least one bipartite component with a non-zero total `r` value. If `ok` is `False`, there does not exist any bipartite component with a non-zero total `r` value.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. It operates using predefined global variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, and `bipartite`. The function appears to perform some form of graph traversal or analysis related to disks defined by their centers (`x[i]`, `y[i]`) and radii (`r[i]`). The function returns no explicit value (implying it may modify global state or have side effects).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
