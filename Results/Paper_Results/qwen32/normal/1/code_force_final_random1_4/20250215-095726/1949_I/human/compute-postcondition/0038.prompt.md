Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the integer input provided (between 1 and 1000); `x` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `y` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `r` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`; `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `tot` is 0; `bipartite` is `True`; `i` is `n`; `ok` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef[i] = 1
        tot = 0
        bipartite = True
        dfs(i)
        ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the integer input provided (between 1 and 1000), `x` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `y` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `r` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[0]` which may be `True` if the if condition was met, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[0]` which may be `1` or potentially updated if the if condition was met, `tot` may be potentially updated, `bipartite` may be potentially `False`, `i` may be potentially updated, and `ok` is `True` if it was `True` initially or if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not `0` after the if condition was met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the integer input provided (between 1 and 1000), `x` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `y` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `r` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[0]` which may be `True` if the if condition was met and `visited[i]` which is `True` if the if condition was met for `i`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[0]` which may be `1` or potentially updated if the if condition was met for `i` and `coef[i]` which is `1` if the if condition was met for `i`, `tot` is updated based on the DFS traversal if the if condition was met, `bipartite` is updated based on the DFS traversal if the if condition was met, `i` is `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), and `ok` is `True` if it was `True` initially or if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not `0` after the if condition was met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the integer input provided (between 1 and 1000), `x` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `y` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `r` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[0]` which may be `True` if the if condition was met and `visited[i]` is now `True` if the if condition was met, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[0]` which may be `1` or potentially updated if the if condition was met for `i` and `coef[i]` is now `1` or potentially updated if the if condition was met, `tot` is potentially updated, `bipartite` is potentially `False`, `i` is `k + 2` (where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), and `ok` is updated to `ok or (bipartite and tot != 0)` if the if condition was met. If the if condition was not met, the variables remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
