The given code snippet only modifies the value of `coef[i]` to `1`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `coef[i]` is set to `1`. The value of `i` is specified as `k + 2` from the previous iteration, but since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we'll keep it as `i`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided (between 1 and 1000), `x` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `y` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `r` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[0]` which may be `True` if the if condition was met and `visited[i]` which is `True` if the if condition was met for `i`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[0]` which may be `1` or potentially updated if the if condition was met for `i` and `coef[i]` which is now `1`, `tot` is updated based on the DFS traversal if the if condition was met, `bipartite` is updated based on the DFS traversal if the if condition was met, `i` is `k + 2` (where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), and `ok` is `True` if it was `True` initially or if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not `0` after the if condition was met.**
