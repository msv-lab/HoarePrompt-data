The given code snippet assigns values to the `i`-th elements of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` using the `map` function to convert the split input into integers. 

Given the initial state, the values of `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are initially `None`. After executing the code, these values are replaced with the integers provided by the input.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided (between 1 and 1000), `x` is a list where `x[i]` is an integer from the input, `y` is a list where `y[i]` is an integer from the input, `r` is a list where `r[i]` is an integer from the input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `tot` and `bipartite` are variables used within the function**.

In simpler terms, the `i`-th elements of `x`, `y`, and `r` are now integers obtained from the input, while all other variables remain unchanged.
