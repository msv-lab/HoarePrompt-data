The code snippet increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Given the initial state, `b[n]` was incremented by 1 previously, and now `b[j]` is also incremented by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is the new input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x` after all iterations, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', `b[n]` is incremented by 1, `b[j]` is incremented by 1.**
