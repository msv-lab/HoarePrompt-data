To determine the output of the `print(nx)` statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state provided:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- We have a string `nx` of length `n`.
- The string `nx` is constructed by appending characters either from `xx[n]` or 'F'/'S' based on some conditions involving `sa`.

### Key Points:
- The exact construction of `nx` depends on the conditions involving `sa`, but the important point is that `nx` is fully determined by these conditions.
- Since the specific conditions and the contents of `xx` and `sa` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact sequence of characters in `nx`.
- However, we know that `nx` is a string of length `n`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, `nx` is a string of length `n` whose exact content is determined by the conditions involving `sa` and `xx[n]`. Since the exact content of `nx` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of its length and the fact that it is fully constructed based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the output of the `print(nx)` statement will be the string `nx` itself, which is a string of length `n` constructed according to the described rules.

### Final Output:
Output: **nx (where nx is a string of length n constructed based on the conditions involving sa and xx[n])**
