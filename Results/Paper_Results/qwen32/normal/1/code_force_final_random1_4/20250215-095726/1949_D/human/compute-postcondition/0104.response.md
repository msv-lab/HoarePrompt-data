The code appends the value of `i` to the list `sa`. Given that `i` is `i + 2`, this means the current value of `i` (which is `i + 2`) is added to the list `sa`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `sa` has `i + 2` appended to it**.
