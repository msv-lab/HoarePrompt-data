The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` increments the variable `nx` by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. Given that `j` is 3, the expression `j - 1` evaluates to 2. Therefore, `xx[i][j - 1]` is equivalent to `xx[i][2]`.

The value of `nx` is updated to its current value plus `xx[i][2]`. The values of `n`, `j`, and `xx` remain unchanged except for `nx`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][2]`**.
