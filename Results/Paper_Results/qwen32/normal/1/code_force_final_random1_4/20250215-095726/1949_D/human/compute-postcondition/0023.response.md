The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 24. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` should be 3 (since it was 2 at the end of the previous iteration and will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration).
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is a string from user input, `j` is 3**
