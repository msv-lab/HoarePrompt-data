Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 24; The input consists of `n` lines, each containing `n` characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is 'F' if the transition video between scenarios i and j is funny, 'S' if it is scary, '?' if it is undecided, or '.' if i = j. The i-th character of the j-th line is the same as the j-th character of the i-th line for all i and j. There are at most ⌊`n`/2⌋ characters in the input that are 'F' or 'S'; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**
