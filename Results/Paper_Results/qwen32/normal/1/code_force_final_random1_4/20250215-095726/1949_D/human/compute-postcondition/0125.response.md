The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at position `j-1` of the string `xx[i]` to the string `nx`. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `nx`, which now includes the additional character.

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `nx` is the original `nx` plus the character `xx[i][j - 1]`.**
