Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][0]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` is updated to include 'F' if `i` is in the list `sa[:n // 4]` or `j` is in the list `sa[:n // 4]`. Otherwise, `nx` is updated to include 'S' at the end.**
