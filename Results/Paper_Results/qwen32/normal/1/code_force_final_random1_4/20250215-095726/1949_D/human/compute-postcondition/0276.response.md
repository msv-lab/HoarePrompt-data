The only variable in the loop head is `j`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 5
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `nx` is determined based on the value of `xx[5][j - 1]` and other conditions

Since `j` ranges from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and we just completed an iteration with the current value of `j`, we need to increment `j` by 1 to proceed to the next iteration.

State: **`i` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2**
