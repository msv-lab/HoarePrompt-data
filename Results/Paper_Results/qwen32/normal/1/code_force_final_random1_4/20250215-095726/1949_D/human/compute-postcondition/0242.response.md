Output State: **`nx` is a string containing the character `xx[4][j - 1]`, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `nx`, which was initially an empty string, now contains the character located at `xx[4][j - 1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition `xx[i][j - 1]` not being equal to '?' remain unchanged.
