The function reads an integer `n` and an `n x n` matrix representing the nature of transition videos between scenarios. It processes this matrix to replace '?' with either 'F' or 'S' based on certain conditions. The function then prints `n` strings, each of length `n`, where each character is either directly from the input matrix or determined by the processing rules.
