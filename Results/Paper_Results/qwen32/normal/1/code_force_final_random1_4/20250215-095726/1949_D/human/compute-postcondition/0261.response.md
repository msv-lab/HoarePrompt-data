Postcondition: **`nx` is a string. If `xx[4][5]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is concatenated with `xx[4][5]`. Otherwise, `nx` is followed by 'S' if `i` (which is 4) or `j` (which is 6) is found in the substring `sb[:n // 4]`; otherwise, `nx` is followed by 'F'. `i` remains 4, `n` remains greater than 6, and `j` remains 6.**
