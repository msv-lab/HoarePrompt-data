Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'. If `i` is in the list `sa[:n // 4]` or `j` is in the list `sa[:n // 4]`, `nx` has been updated to include 'F'. Otherwise, `i` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, `j` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, and `nx` has been updated to include 'S' at the end.**
