Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is a string from user input, `j` is 2. If the element at index 1 of `x` is 'F', then `a[1]` and `a[2]` have each been incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the element at index 1 of `x` is 'S', then `b[1]` and `b[2]` have each been incremented by 1.**
