Postcondition: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` contains indices `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`. `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `nx` is an empty string, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'. Additionally, either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`.**
