The given code snippet initializes a new variable `nx` as an empty string. This does not affect any of the previously mentioned variables (`a`, `n`, `sa`, `i`). The variable `nx` is newly introduced and set to an empty string.

Output State: **a string of length `n` constructed by appending characters from `xx[n]` or 'F'/'S' based on the conditions involving `sa`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `nx` is an empty string.**
