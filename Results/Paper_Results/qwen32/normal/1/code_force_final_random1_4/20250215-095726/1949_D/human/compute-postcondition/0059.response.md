Output State: **`x` is the input string, `xx` includes the new `x` as its last element, `a` and `b` arrays are based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in the old `x` after all iterations, `i` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The only change is that `xx` now includes the new `x` as its last element. All other variables (`x`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
