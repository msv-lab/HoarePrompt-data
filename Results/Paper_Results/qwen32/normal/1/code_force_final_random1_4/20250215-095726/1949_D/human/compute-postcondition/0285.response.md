The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. However, `nx` is not defined in the initial state, which means the code would raise a `NameError` because `nx` is being referenced before assignment. Since the task specifies to simulate the execution based on the given initial state and the code snippet, we'll assume `nx` was intended to be part of the initial state or was defined elsewhere in the program not shown here.

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume `nx` was initially an empty string or some string value. Given the information, we'll proceed by appending 'F' to whatever `nx` was.

If we assume `nx` was initially an empty string, then after the operation, `nx` would be 'F'. If `nx` had some other string value, it would now be that value plus 'F'.

Since the exact initial value of `nx` is not provided, we'll describe the output state in terms of the operation performed:

Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'F'**.
