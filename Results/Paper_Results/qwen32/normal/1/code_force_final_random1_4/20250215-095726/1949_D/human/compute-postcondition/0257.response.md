To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its effect on the variables.

The code snippet is:
```python
nx += xx[i][j - 1]
```

Given the initial state:
- `nx` is a string
- `i` is 4
- `n` is greater than 6 (this does not affect the current operation)
- `j` is 6

The operation `xx[i][j - 1]` will access the element in the 2D list `xx` at row index `i` (which is 4) and column index `j - 1` (which is 5). This means we are accessing `xx[4][5]`.

After obtaining the value from `xx[4][5]`, it is concatenated to the string `nx`.

Since the exact value of `xx[4][5]` is not specified, we will denote it as `xx[4][5]`. Therefore, the new value of `nx` will be the original `nx` concatenated with `xx[4][5]`.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`nx` is a string concatenated with `xx[4][5]`, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 6, `j` is 6**.
