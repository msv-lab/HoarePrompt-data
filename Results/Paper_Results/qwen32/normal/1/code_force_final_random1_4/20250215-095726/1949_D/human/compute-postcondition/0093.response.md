The code snippet `sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `sa`. Given the initial state, `sa` was initially an empty list. After executing the code, `sa` will contain one element, which is the value of `i`.

The values of `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sb`, and `n` remain unchanged. The conditions regarding `a` and `b` at index `i` also remain valid.

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the value `i`, `sb` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and at index `i`, `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is equal to 0.**
