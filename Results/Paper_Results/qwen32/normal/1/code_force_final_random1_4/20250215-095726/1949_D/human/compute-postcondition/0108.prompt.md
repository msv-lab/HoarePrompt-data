Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sa.append(i)
    if b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0:
        sb.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the value `i` if `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is equal to 0, otherwise `sa` remains an empty list, `sb` is a list containing the value `i` if `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is equal to 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then `sa` includes the value of `i`. If `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, then `sb` includes the value of `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 2` and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, then `sb` has `i` appended to it. If `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then `sa` has `i + 2` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
