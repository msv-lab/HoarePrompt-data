To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `k`, where `1 <= k < n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `k + 1`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment in `i`.

State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0` including the newly added `i`, and `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `n` remains the same.**

Since we don't know the exact value of `k` (the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0` including the newly added `i`, and `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `n` remains the same.**
