Postcondition: **`i` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2. If `xx[5][1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to its previous value plus `xx[5][1]`. Otherwise, `nx` is updated to its previous value plus 'S' if `i` or `j` is found in `sb[:n // 4]`, or `nx` has 'F' appended to it if neither `i` nor `j` is found in `sb[:n // 4]`.**
