The given code snippet modifies the variable `nx` by appending the character at position `j - 1` from the string `xx[i]` to it. Here's the breakdown:

- `nx` is updated to include the character `xx[i][j - 1]`.
- All other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `n`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Given that `j` is `j + 2` in the initial state, the character appended to `nx` is from the position `j - 1` which is effectively the original `j + 1`.

Output State: **`a` contains cumulative counts of 'F' transitions, `b` contains cumulative counts of 'S' transitions, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements starting with an empty string followed by the `n` input strings, `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` contains indices `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `j + 2`, `nx` is updated to include `xx[i][j - 1]`.**
