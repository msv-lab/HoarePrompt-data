Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, and `nx` is updated as follows: if `xx[i][2]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` is incremented by the value of `xx[i][2]`. Otherwise, `nx` is appended with 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4]`; otherwise, `nx` is appended with 'S'.**
