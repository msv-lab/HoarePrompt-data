Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24) representing the number of scenarios. It also accepts an n x n matrix where each element is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', representing the nature of the transition video between scenarios. The function returns a string indicating whether it's possible to determine if the sequence of videos can be arranged such that no two consecutive videos are both scary ('S'). If it's possible, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".**
