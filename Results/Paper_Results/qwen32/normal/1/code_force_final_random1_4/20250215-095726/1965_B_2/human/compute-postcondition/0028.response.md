The code appends `2 * k + 1` to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 < k \leq n\); `b` is the binary string representation of `n`; `l` is the length of `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k`; `ans` is a list containing `[2, 8, 16, 32, k - 59, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`; `lk` is 5.**
