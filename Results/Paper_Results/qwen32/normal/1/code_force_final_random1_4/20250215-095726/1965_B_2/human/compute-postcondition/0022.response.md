The code appends \(2^i\) to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 3, the value \(2^3\) (which is 8) is appended to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 < k \leq n\); `b` is the binary string representation of `n`; `l` is the length of `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k`; `ans` is a list containing `[2, 8]`; `i` is 3; `lk` is the length of `bk`**.
