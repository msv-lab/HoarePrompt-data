Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

    #The program returns either '2 3 4 8 16' if k equals 1, or '2 8 16 32 -49 11 21 2 32 64' if k does not equal 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k` where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`. It returns '1\n2' if `n` equals 2 and `k` equals 1. Otherwise, it returns a space-separated string of integers. If `k` equals 1, the returned string is '2 3 4 8 16'. If `k` does not equal 1, the returned string is a sequence of integers that depends on the values of `n` and `k`.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters in its signature. It relies on other functions (`func_10` and `func_14`) which are not defined in the provided code snippet. However, based on the usage, `func_10()` likely returns the number of test cases (t), and `func_14()` likely processes each test case to determine the required sequence and its size.

    #
    #If we assume `num_iterations` is 3 based on the given examples, the output would look like this:
    #```
    #result1
    #result2
    #result3
    #```
    #
    #However, without knowing the exact number of iterations and the specific results from `func_14()`, we can only describe the output state in a generalized form.

    #Therefore, the final output state in the required format is:

    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It determines the number of test cases using `func_10()` and processes each test case using `func_14()`. For each test case, it outputs the result returned by `func_14()` on a new line.
