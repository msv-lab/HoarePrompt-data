To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i`, `lk`, and `l`. However, `lk` is not mentioned in the given state, so we will assume it remains constant unless specified otherwise.

Given:
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(lk, l):`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 5.
- `l` is 6.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 6.

The variable `lk` is not mentioned in the state change, so we will assume it remains unchanged. The value of `l` is also provided and does not need adjustment.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

State: **`n` is 32, `k` is 10, `b` is '100000', `l` is 6, `bk` is '1010', `ans` is [2, 8, 16, 32, -49, 11, 21, 2, 32], `i` is 6**
