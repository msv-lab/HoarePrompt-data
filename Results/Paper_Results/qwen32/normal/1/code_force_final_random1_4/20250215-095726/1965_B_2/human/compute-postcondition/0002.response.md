In this case, the loop head only contains the underscore `_` and the result of the function call `func_10()`. Since the underscore `_` is used as a throwaway variable, it does not hold any state that needs to be adjusted. The only state that could change and affect the continuation of the loop is the return value of `func_10()`.

Given that `func_10()` determines the number of iterations, let's denote its return value as `num_iterations`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know that the loop has already executed some number of times, and we need to determine if it should execute again based on the value of `num_iterations`.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, the loop has executed `k` times. Therefore, the loop will continue to execute as long as `k < num_iterations`. To prepare for the next iteration, `k` should be incremented by 1.

However, since we don't have direct access to `k` (it's implied by the number of times the loop has run), we can only adjust our understanding of `num_iterations` based on the assumption that it remains constant unless explicitly changed by the loop body (which is omitted here).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **the output state you calculate, `num_iterations` remains the same, and the loop will execute again if the current iteration count is less than `num_iterations`**

Since we don't have an explicit iteration count or a way to directly modify it, we'll represent the state in terms of the loop's continuation condition:

State: **`num_iterations` is the same as at the end of the previous iteration** 

If we were to explicitly represent the iteration count, it would look something like this, assuming `k` is the current iteration count:

State: **`k` is incremented by 1, `num_iterations` remains the same**

But given the constraints and the information provided, the most accurate representation without additional context is:

State: **the output state you calculate, `num_iterations` remains the same**
