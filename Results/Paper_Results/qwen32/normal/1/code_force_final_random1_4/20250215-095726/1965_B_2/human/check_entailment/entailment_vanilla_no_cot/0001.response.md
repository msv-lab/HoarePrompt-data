Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Logic for Generating the Sequence:**
   - The function `func_14()` is responsible for generating the sequence for each test case.
   - If `k == 1`, it handles this as a special case:
     - If `n == 2`, it returns `[2]`.
     - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and continues with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - For `k > 1`, it constructs the sequence as follows:
     - It generates powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k-1`.
     - It appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure that the sum of the initial part of the sequence does not reach `k`.
     - It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to avoid creating a subsequence that sums to `k`.
     - It continues appending powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the length of the sequence and the sequence itself for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Special Case (`k == 1`):**
  - When `k == 1`, the sequence generated ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, while all other sums up to `n` (except 1) can be achieved.
  - For `n == 2`, the sequence `[2]` works because there is no way to form a sum of 1.
  - For `n > 2`, the sequence `[2, 3]` along with powers of 2 ensures that all sums except 1 can be formed.

- **General Case (`k > 1`):**
  - The inclusion of `k - 1 - sum(ans)` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`.
  - The inclusion of `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` further avoids creating a subsequence that sums to `k`.
  - The powers of 2 ensure that all sums up to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate sequences that meet the problem's requirements for both the special case (`k == 1`) and the general case (`k > 1`). The logic seems sound and the implementation correctly handles the constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
