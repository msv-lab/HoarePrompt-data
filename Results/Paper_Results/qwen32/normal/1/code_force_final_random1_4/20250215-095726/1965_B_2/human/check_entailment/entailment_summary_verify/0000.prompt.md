You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 15 : The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It determines the number of test cases using `func_10()` and processes each test case using `func_14()`. For each test case, it outputs the result returned by `func_14()` on a new line.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
  - There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
  - For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

### Program Analysis:
The program defines several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_15`) and focuses on `func_14` which constructs the sequence `a` for each test case. Let's break down `func_14`:

#### Function `func_14`:
1. **Reading Input**: It reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Binary Representation**: Converts `n` and `k` to their binary representations.
3. **Handling Special Case `k == 1`**:
   - If `n == 2`, returns `[2]`.
   - Otherwise, initializes the sequence with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
4. **General Case**:
   - Initializes the sequence with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
   - Appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - Appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence.
   - Appends additional powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

### Verification:
1. **Special Case `k == 1`**:
   - For `n == 2`, the sequence `[2]` works because the only possible sum is `2`, which is not `1`.
   - For other values of `n`, the sequence `[2, 3]` along with powers of 2 ensures that all sums except `1` are covered.

2. **General Case**:
   - The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`. This ensures that all sums up to `k-1` can be formed.
   - The term `k - 1 - sum(ans)` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - Additional terms `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` along with further powers of 2 ensure that all sums up to `n` except `k` can be formed.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- **Small Values**: Test with small values of `n` and `k` to ensure correctness.
- **Large Values**: Test with large values of `n` and `k` to ensure the sequence does not exceed size 25 and meets the criteria.
- **Edge Cases**: Test with `k = 1` and `n = 2` specifically, as this is a special case handled separately.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program seems to handle all cases correctly. The constructed sequence ensures that all sums from `1` to `n` except `k` can be formed, and no subsequence sums to `k`.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly constructs the sequence `a` for each test case, ensuring that all sums from `1` to `n` except `k` can be formed, and no subsequence sums to `k`. The handling of special cases and general cases appears to be correct based on the provided logic.
