Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from all the strings `b` that contained '1'.
- `i` is `n + 1` where `n` is the number of iterations.
- `a` is greater than `i`.
- The first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('TRIANGLE')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It simply outputs the string `'TRIANGLE'`. None of the variables (`k`, `i`, `a`) are used in the `print` statement, so their specific values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is the string `'TRIANGLE'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **TRIANGLE**
