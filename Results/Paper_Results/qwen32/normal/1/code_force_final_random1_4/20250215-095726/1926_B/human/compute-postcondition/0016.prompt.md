Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of strings, where each string consists of n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1; `a` must be greater than 0; `k` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of strings, where each string consists of n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1; `a` is greater than 0; `k` is a list containing one element, which is the count of '1's in `b` if `b` contains at least one '1'. Otherwise, `k` remains an empty list; `b` is the input provided by the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of strings, where each string consists of n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1; `a` is greater than 0; `k` is a list containing two elements, each being the count of '1's in `b` if `b` contains at least one '1'; `b` is the input provided by the user; the next call to `int(input())` will return an integer greater than 0, allowing the loop to execute one more time. If `b` does not contain any '1's, `k` remains unchanged as an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of strings, where each string consists of n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1; `a` is greater than 0; `b` is the input provided by the user. If '1' is in `b`, then `k` is a list containing three elements, each being the count of '1's in `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
