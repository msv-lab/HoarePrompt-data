You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and the grid is an n × n list of strings, where each string consists of n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')
        
    #State: - The loop will continue to execute until it has completed `a` iterations.
    #   - Each iteration independently processes its own set of input lines and prints "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" based on the comparison of the first two counts in `k` for that iteration.
    #   - The state of `t`, `n`, `grid`, and `a` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution except for the variable `i` in the loop header which simply tracks the current iteration number.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #- The final output state will consist of `a` print statements, each being either "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE", depending on the comparison of the first two counts of '1's in the lines read during each iteration.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) and an `n × n` grid of strings composed of '0's and '1's. Each grid contains exactly one triangle or one square made up of '1's with a size greater than 1. The function returns the type of shape ('triangle' or 'square') found in each grid.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
