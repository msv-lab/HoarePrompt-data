You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and the grid is an n × n list of strings, where each string consists of n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1.

    #State: - The loop will continue to execute until it has completed `a` iterations.
    #   - Each iteration independently processes its own set of input lines and prints "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" based on the comparison of the first two counts in `k` for that iteration.
    #   - The state of `t`, `n`, `grid`, and `a` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution except for the variable `i` in the loop header which simply tracks the current iteration number.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #- The final output state will consist of `a` print statements, each being either "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE", depending on the comparison of the first two counts of '1's in the lines read during each iteration.
    #
    #### Final Output State:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program attempts to determine whether a given grid contains a square or a triangle based on the counts of '1's in each row. However, this approach is flawed because it only checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal to classify the shape as a square. This is insufficient to correctly identify squares and triangles as described in the problem statement.

Here are a few reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Triangle Detection**: The program does not check for the specific pattern required for a triangle. A triangle consists of `k` rows where the `i-th` row has `2*i - 1` consecutive '1's centered in the grid. The program does not verify this pattern.

2. **Square Detection**: While the program checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal, this is not sufficient to confirm that the entire shape is a square. A square requires that all rows have the same number of '1's and that they are aligned at the same distance from the left edge of the grid.

Let's consider a counterexample where the program will fail:

**Counterexample Input:**
```
1
4
0010
0110
0110
0010
```

**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```

**Actual Output:**
```
SQUARE
```

In this example, the program will incorrectly classify the shape as a square because the counts of '1's in the first two rows are both 1, but the shape is actually a triangle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
