Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; `grid` is an n × n list of strings, where each string consists of n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1; `a` is greater than 0; `b` is the input provided by the user. If '1' is in `b`, then `k` is a list containing three elements, each being the count of '1's in `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.**
