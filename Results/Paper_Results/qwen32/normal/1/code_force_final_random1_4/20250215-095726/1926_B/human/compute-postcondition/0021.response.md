Postcondition: **`k` is a list containing up to `t` elements, each being the count of '1's in `b` if `b` contains at least one '1'. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`. Otherwise, the first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`.**
