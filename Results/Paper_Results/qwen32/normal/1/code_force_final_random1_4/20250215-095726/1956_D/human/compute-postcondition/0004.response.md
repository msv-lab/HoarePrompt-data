To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `ops`, which is a list of tuples `(l, r)`.

Given the information:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`.

The loop will execute if `ops` contains at least one tuple `(l, r)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `ops` is not empty.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the relevant variable**: The variable in the loop head is `ops`.
2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `ops` contains at least one tuple `(l, r)`.
3. **Adjust the state**: Ensure that `ops` is a non-empty list of tuples.

Since `ops` is derived from `func_2(a)`, we cannot directly modify `ops`. However, we can infer that `func_2(a)` should return a non-empty `ops` list for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input `a` is such that `func_2(a)` returns a non-empty `ops`.

However, since we are only allowed to adjust the state of objects in the loop head, we can only specify that `ops` must be non-empty.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where 1 <= len(a) <= 18 and 0 <= a[i] <= 10^7 for each element a[i] in a; `n` is an input integer; `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, where `ops` must be a non-empty list of tuples**.
