Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

If `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, `a` may be modified by calling `func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)` and the tuple `(l, r)` is added to `ops`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function modifies the list `a` by setting certain subarrays to a specific value based on the condition that the sum of the subarray should match the length of the subarray. It records these modifications in the list `ops` as tuples indicating the start and end indices of the modified subarrays. The function does not return any value.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of integers `a` as input, computes the sum of all integers in the list, and returns a tuple containing this sum, the length of an operations list `ops`, and the `ops` list itself. The operations list `ops` is not modified or used within the provided code snippet, so its length will be zero and it will be empty.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), where a is a list of integers.
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])

If `pos` was not equal to `l` initially, `pos` may have changed based on the function's logic.
        if (pos != r) :

If `s` is less than or equal to (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), then `a[i]` is `r - l + 1` for all `i` in `[l, r]`, `s` is adjusted accordingly, `result` is returned, and `ops` contains an additional tuple `(l, r)`. Otherwise, `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, and `pos` is the index of `mx` in the list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `recursive_maximize_sum` modifies a list `a` by potentially changing the values within a specified range `[l, r]` based on certain conditions. It appends operations to a list `ops` and ensures that if the sum of the elements in the range `[l, r]` is less than or equal to the square of the length of the range, all elements in that range are set to the length of the range. Otherwise, it recursively processes subranges around the maximum element in the range.

    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where 1 <= len(a) <= 18 and 0 <= a[i] <= 10^7 for each element a[i] in a; `n` is an input integer; `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, where all tuples in `ops` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers from the input, computes the sum and maximum of the list, prints these values, and then prints a series of operations (if any) returned by another function `func_2`. The final state includes the printed sum and maximum of the list, along with any additional operations.
