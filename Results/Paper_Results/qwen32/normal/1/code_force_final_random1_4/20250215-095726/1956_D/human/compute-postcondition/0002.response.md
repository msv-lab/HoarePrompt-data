To determine the output state, we need to understand what the function `func_2` does with the input list `a`. Since the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we cannot determine the exact values of `s`, `m`, and `ops` directly. However, we can assume that `func_2` returns three values based on the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where 1 <= len(a) <= 18 and 0 <= a[i] <= 10^7 for each element a[i] in a.
- `n` is an input integer.

After executing `s, m, ops = func_2(a)`, the variables `s`, `m`, and `ops` will be assigned the values returned by `func_2`. The values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within `func_2`, which they are not in this context.

Therefore, the output state will include the new variables `s`, `m`, and `ops` along with the unchanged `a` and `n`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where 1 <= len(a) <= 18 and 0 <= a[i] <= 10^7 for each element a[i] in a; `n` is an input integer; `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`**.
