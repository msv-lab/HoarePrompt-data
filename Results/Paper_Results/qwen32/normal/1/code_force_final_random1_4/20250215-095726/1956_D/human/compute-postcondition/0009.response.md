To determine the output of the `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `a` is a list of integers with constraints on its length and the range of its elements.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are values returned by the function `func_2(a)`. Specifically, `ops` is a non-empty list of tuples.
- `(l, r)` is assigned the value of `(l_next, r_next)`.

However, the specific details about the function `func_2(a)` and the values of `l_next` and `r_next` are not provided. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Given that `(l, r)` is assigned `(l_next, r_next)`, the print statement will output the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`.

Output: **l + 1, r + 1 (where l and r are the values of l_next and r_next respectively)**
