### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the array `a` using a limited number of operations.
- Each operation involves choosing a subarray and setting all its elements to the MEX of the subarray.
- The MEX (minimum excluded value) is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to handle the base case when `l == r` by setting `a[l]` to 0 if it's not already 0 and recording the operation.
   - For `l < r`, it recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`, and then checks if `a[l]` needs to be updated to `r - l + 1`. If it does, it performs the operation and updates the array.
   - The function modifies the `ops` list directly, which is problematic because `ops` is not passed as a parameter. This can lead to incorrect behavior if `ops` is not defined globally.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum`.
   - However, `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, which means the operations won't be recorded properly.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function calculates the sum of the subarray from index `l` to `r`.
   - It checks if the current sum is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If true, it calls `func_1` and then sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1`.
   - If the sum condition is not met, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and splits the subarray around this maximum element, recursively calling itself on the left and right parts.
   - Similar to `func_1`, this function also modifies the global `ops` list without passing it as a parameter.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and operations, and prints the results.
   - Since `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum` do not correctly pass and modify the `ops` list, the operations recorded will be incomplete or incorrect.

#### Issues Identified:
- The functions `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` modify a global `ops` list without passing it as a parameter. This leads to incorrect recording of operations.
- The logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` for splitting the array around the maximum element and updating the array might not be optimal for maximizing the sum.
- The overall structure of the program does not ensure that the operations are correctly recorded and applied.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
Given the identified issues, particularly the incorrect handling of the `ops` list and the potential inefficiency in maximizing the sum, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all possible inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The program is incorrect due to improper handling of the operations list and potential inefficiencies in the logic for maximizing the sum.
