The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. This means that the original value of `a` (which was a list of integers) is overwritten by the new list of integers obtained from the input.

Since the input operation changes the value of `a`, we need to reflect this in our output state. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where 1 <= len(a) <= 18 and 0 <= a[i] <= 10^7 for each element a[i] in a; `n` is an input integer.**
