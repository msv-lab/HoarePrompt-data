Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Function Calls and Definitions:**
   - `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum` but `recursive_maximize_sum` is defined to take parameters `l` and `r`, but it is called without these parameters.
   - `recursive_maximize_sum` uses the variable `a` which is not passed as a parameter and is not defined within the function scope.
   - `ops` is used in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` but is not passed as a parameter to `recursive_maximize_sum`.

2. **Logic Errors:**
   - The logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` seems flawed. For example, `func_1` modifies the array to set all elements in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1` if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. This does not align with the MEX operation described in the problem.
   - The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` in `recursive_maximize_sum` is not clearly justified and may not correctly determine when to apply the MEX operation.

3. **Missing Implementation Details:**
   - The MEX operation is not correctly implemented. The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set. The current implementation does not calculate the MEX correctly.
   - The operations list `ops` is not correctly maintained and used throughout the functions.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle edge cases such as arrays with all elements being the same, arrays with all elements being zero, or arrays with very large values.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
