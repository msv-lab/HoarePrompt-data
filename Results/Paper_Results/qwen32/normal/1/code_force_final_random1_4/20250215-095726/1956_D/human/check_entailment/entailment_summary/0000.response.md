### Reasoning:

Let's analyze each function in the context of the problem statement and the provided execution summaries.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- **Purpose**: This function appears to modify the array `a` by setting certain subarrays to a specific value based on the condition that the sum of the subarray should match the length of the subarray. It also records these modifications in the list `ops`.
- **Execution Summary**: The function modifies the array `a` by setting subarrays to the MEX value and records the operations in `ops`. However, the summary suggests that it sets the entire subarray to `r - l + 1` if the current sum does not match the length of the subarray. This seems to be an attempt to maximize the sum by ensuring that the subarray contains the maximum possible unique values up to `r - l + 1`.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- **Purpose**: This function computes the sum of the array `a` and returns a tuple containing this sum, the length of an operations list `ops`, and the `ops` list itself.
- **Execution Summary**: The function calls `recursive_maximize_sum` but does not pass the `ops` list correctly, leading to an undefined variable error. Additionally, the `ops` list is not modified or used within the provided code snippet, so its length will be zero and it will be empty.

#### Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`):
- **Purpose**: This function modifies the array `a` by potentially changing the values within a specified range `[l, r]` based on certain conditions. It appends operations to a list `ops` and ensures that if the sum of the elements in the range `[l, r]` is less than or equal to the square of the length of the range, all elements in that range are set to the length of the range. Otherwise, it recursively processes subranges around the maximum element in the range.
- **Execution Summary**: The function attempts to maximize the sum of the array by setting subarrays to their MEX values or the maximum possible value if the current sum is less than the square of the length of the subarray. It recursively divides the array into smaller subarrays around the maximum element if needed.

#### Function 4 (`func_3`):
- **Purpose**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to compute the sum and operations, and prints the results.
- **Execution Summary**: The function reads the input, calls `func_2` (which is flawed due to the missing `ops` parameter), and prints the sum and operations. Since `func_2` does not correctly pass the `ops` list, the operations will not be recorded or printed.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Parameter Passing**: In `func_2`, the `ops` list is not passed to `recursive_maximize_sum`, leading to an undefined variable error.
2. **Incomplete Implementation**: The `ops` list is not correctly populated or used, which means the operations are not recorded or printed.
3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` might not correctly implement the MEX operation as intended. The current implementation sets the subarray to `r - l + 1` without considering the actual MEX value.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, particularly the incorrect parameter passing and incomplete implementation of the operations list, the program does not fully meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
