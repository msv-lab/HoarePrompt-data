The function `recursive_maximize_sum` modifies a list `a` by potentially changing the values within a specified range `[l, r]` based on certain conditions. It appends operations to a list `ops` and ensures that if the sum of the elements in the range `[l, r]` is less than or equal to the square of the length of the range, all elements in that range are set to the length of the range. Otherwise, it recursively processes subranges around the maximum element in the range.
