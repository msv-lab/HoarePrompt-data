The given code snippet calls a function `recursive_maximize_sum` with the arguments `pos + 1` and `r`. This function call does not directly modify the variables `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos` in the provided initial state. Instead, it likely performs some operations within the function that could potentially affect these variables indirectly upon returning.

However, since the problem specifies to only consider the direct changes to the variables due to the provided code snippet and there are no explicit assignments or modifications to the variables in the snippet itself, we can infer that the variables retain their original values unless explicitly changed by the function `recursive_maximize_sum`.

Given that the function call does not directly alter the variables in the initial state, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the addition of the function call being made.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a); `s` is the sum of the elements from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) in the list `a` and is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1); `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`; `pos` is the index of `mx` in the list `a`. The current value of `pos` is not equal to `r`. The function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called.**
