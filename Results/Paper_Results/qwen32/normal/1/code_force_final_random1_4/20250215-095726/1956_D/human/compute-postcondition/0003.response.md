To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, m)` statement, let's break down the given initial state:

- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, with constraints \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 18\) and \(0 \leq a[i] \leq 10^7\) for each element \(a[i]\) in \(a\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by the function `func_2(a)`.

Given this information, we need to understand what `s` and `m` represent. Since the function `func_2(a)` is not explicitly defined in the problem statement, we can only infer their values based on common practices and typical outputs of such functions.

Typically, functions that process lists might return:
- `s`: The sum of the elements in the list `a`.
- `m`: The maximum value in the list `a`.

However, without the exact definition of `func_2(a)`, we can only hypothesize based on these common practices. Therefore, we will assume that `s` is the sum of the elements in `a` and `m` is the maximum value in `a`.

Let's proceed with this assumption:

- `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `m` is the maximum value among all elements in the list `a`.

Thus, the `print(s, m)` statement will output these two values.

Output: **s (where s is the sum of all elements in the list `a`), m (where m is the maximum value in the list `a`)**
