### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Provided Code:
```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

#### Function Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, it calculates `b + c` and then prints either `(a + (b // 3))` if `c` is not less than `b % 3`, or `-1` if `c` is less than `b % 3`.

### Analysis:

1. **Combining Extroverts and Universals**:
   - The line `b += c` combines the number of extroverts and universals into a single variable `b`. This is problematic because it doesn't distinguish between extroverts who need to be in groups of three and universals who can fill any gaps.

2. **Tent Calculation**:
   - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` attempts to calculate the number of tents but has several issues:
     - `-b // 3` is not the correct way to calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. The correct approach involves calculating the number of full groups of three extroverts (`b // 3`) and handling any leftover extroverts separately.
     - The condition `[c < b % 3]` checks if there are enough universals to handle the leftover extroverts. However, this check is not correctly implemented due to the incorrect combination of `b` and `c`.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need:
1. Allocate one tent per introvert.
2. Determine how many complete groups of three extroverts can be formed (`b // 3`).
3. Check if there are any leftover extroverts (`b % 3`):
   - If `b % 3 == 0`, no additional tents are needed for extroverts.
   - If `b % 3 == 1`, we need one more tent if there are enough universals to pair with the leftover extrovert.
   - If `b % 3 == 2`, we need one more tent if there are enough universals to pair with the two leftover extroverts.

### Corrected Code:
Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    t = int(input[0])
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(input[idx])
        b = int(input[idx + 1])
        c = int(input[idx + 2])
        idx += 3
        
        # Tents for introverts
        tents = a
        
        # Tents for extroverts
        full_groups = b // 3
        leftover_extroverts = b % 3
        
        # Add tents for full groups of extroverts
        tents += full_groups
        
        # Handle leftover extroverts
        if leftover_extroverts == 1:
            if c >= 1:
                tents += 1
                c -= 1
            else:
                print(-1)
                continue
        elif leftover_extroverts == 2:
            if c >= 1:
                tents += 1
                c -= 1
            else:
                print(-1)
                continue
        
        print(tents)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: False**
