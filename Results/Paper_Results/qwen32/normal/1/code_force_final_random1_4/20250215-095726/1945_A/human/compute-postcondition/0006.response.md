The value of `b` is updated to be the sum of its original value and the value of `c`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the input list from open(0) must have at least t+1 elements where the first element is `t` and the next t elements are triples of integers a, b, c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the split string `s` plus `c`, and `c` is the third integer from the split string `s`. `s` is the next triple (a, b, c) in the list.**
