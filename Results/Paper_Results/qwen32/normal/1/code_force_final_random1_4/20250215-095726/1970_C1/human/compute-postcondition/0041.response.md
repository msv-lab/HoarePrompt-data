To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state:

- `tmp` is described but not used in the print statement.
- `one` is either `True` or `False`.
- `two` is explicitly set to `False`.

The print statement uses a conditional expression:
```python
print('Hermione' if two and one else 'Ron')
```

Here, the condition `two and one` needs to be evaluated:
- Since `two` is `False`, the entire condition `two and one` will always be `False` regardless of the value of `one`. This is because in Python, the `and` operator requires both operands to be `True` for the result to be `True`.

Given this, the expression `'Hermione' if two and one else 'Ron'` simplifies to `'Ron'` because the condition `two and one` is `False`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **Ron**
