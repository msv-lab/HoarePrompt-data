Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `queue` has one less element than before, `current` holds the node that was at the front of the `queue`, `dist` holds the distance associated with `current`, and `visited` contains all nodes reachable from `start`. If `current` is equal to `target`, the program returns `dist`.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `current` holds the node that was at the front of the `queue` and `tree[current]` contains at least one neighbor. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, the `queue` includes the tuple `((neighbor, dist + 1))`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `current` holds the node that was at the front of the `queue` and `tree[current]` contains at least one more neighbor that has not been processed as `neighbor`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, then `visited` includes `neighbor` and `queue` now includes an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `current` holds the node that was at the front of the `queue` and `tree[current]` contains at least one more neighbor that has not been processed as `neighbor`. If `neighbor` was not in `visited`, it is now added to `visited` and the `queue` includes a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. If `neighbor` was already in `visited`, no changes are made to `visited` or `queue`. `neighbor` remains the next unprocessed neighbor in `tree[current]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
