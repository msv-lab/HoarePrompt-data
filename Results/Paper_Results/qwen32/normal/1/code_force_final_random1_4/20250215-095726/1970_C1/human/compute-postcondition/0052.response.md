The only variable in the loop head is `neighbor`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `neighbor` for the loop to execute one more time. Given that `tree[current]` contains at least one more neighbor that has not been processed as `neighbor`, we need to set `neighbor` to the next unprocessed neighbor in `tree[current]`.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`current` holds the node that was at the front of the `queue` and `tree[current]` contains at least one more neighbor that has not been processed as `neighbor`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, then `visited` includes `neighbor` and `queue` now includes an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. `neighbor` is the next unprocessed neighbor in `tree[current]`.**
