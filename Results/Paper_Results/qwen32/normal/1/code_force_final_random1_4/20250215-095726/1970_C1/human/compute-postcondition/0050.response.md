Output State: **`current` holds the node that was at the front of the `queue` and `tree[current]` contains at least one more neighbor that has not been processed as `neighbor`. `visited` includes `neighbor`. `queue` now includes an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.**

This means that `queue` has been updated to include a new element, which is a tuple consisting of `neighbor` and `dist + 1`. All other conditions remain the same.
