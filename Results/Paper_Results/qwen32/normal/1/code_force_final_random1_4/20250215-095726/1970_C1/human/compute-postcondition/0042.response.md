Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), an integer `t` which is always 1, and a list of `n-1` edges representing the connections between the nodes in the tree. Additionally, it accepts an integer `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) indicating the initial node where a stone is placed. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. The function returns the number of moves required to move the stone from the initial node `u_1` to one of the leaves of the tree.**
