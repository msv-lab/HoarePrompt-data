The given code snippet modifies the `rev` dictionary by appending the integer `a` to the list associated with the key `b`. This means that if `b` was already a key in `rev`, the list associated with `b` will now include `a` as an additional element. If `b` was not previously a key in `rev`, it will become a key with a list containing only `a`.

Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed. `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 1, `y` is an integer read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where `lst[a]` now contains `b` appended to its list. `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, and `rev[b]` now includes `a` appended to its list. `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**

In simpler terms: The `rev` dictionary has been updated so that the list associated with key `b` includes the integer `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
