The code updates the value of `y` to be the count of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`. The values of `t`, `a`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is the new integer input by the user; `s` is the new string input by the user; `x` is the count of occurrences of 'map' in `s`; `y` is the count of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.**
