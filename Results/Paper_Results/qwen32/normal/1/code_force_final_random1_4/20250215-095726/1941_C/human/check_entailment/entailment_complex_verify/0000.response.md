### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed from a string to ensure that it no longer contains the substrings "map" or "pie". The provided solution counts the occurrences of these substrings and outputs their sum.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution uses the `count` method to find the number of non-overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the string and sums these counts. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to minimize deletions.

#### Counterexamples:
1. **Input:**
   ```
   1
   5
   mpaim
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** `1` (remove one 'm' to get "paie" or "mpai")
   - **Actual Output:** `1` (correct in this case)

2. **Input:**
   ```
   1
   6
   mpamap
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** `2` (remove the first and last 'm' to get "pama")
   - **Actual Output:** `2` (correct in this case)

3. **Input:**
   ```
   1
   7
   mapie
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** `3` (remove all characters to get an empty string)
   - **Actual Output:** `2` (incorrect, as it only counts "map" and "pie" once each, but they overlap)

4. **Input:**
   ```
   1
   8
   mappppie
   ```
   - **Expected Output:** `2` (remove the first 'm' and the last 'e' to get "pappie")
   - **Actual Output:** `2` (correct in this case, but the logic is not robust enough)

#### Flaw in the Provided Solution:
The provided solution simply counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" without considering how these occurrences might overlap or how to optimally remove characters to achieve the minimum deletions. This approach fails when substrings overlap or when there are multiple ways to remove characters to achieve the same result with fewer deletions.

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution is not correct because it does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. It only counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" without considering optimal removal strategies.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
