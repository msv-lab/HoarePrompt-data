Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a ribbon divided into `n` cells, each either containing a chip (`1`) or being free (`0`).
- We need to move chips to form a single contiguous block with the minimum number of moves.
- A move consists of shifting a chip to the closest free cell to its left.
- The program needs to handle multiple test cases.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))
```

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Range for `z`:**
   - `x` is the index of the first `1` from the left.
   - `y` is the index of the first `1` from the right (in the reversed array), which translates to `n - y - 1` in the original array.
   - The slice `arr[x:n - y]` is incorrect because `n - y` might go out of bounds or not cover the correct range.
   
2. **Incorrect Counting of Moves:**
   - The number of moves required to form a contiguous block is not correctly calculated by simply counting zeros in the slice `z`.

### Correct Approach:
- Identify the leftmost and rightmost chips.
- Calculate the number of free cells between these two positions.
- The number of moves required will be the number of free cells minus the number of chips in between (since those chips don't need to move).

### Test Cases:
Let's consider the provided example inputs:
1. For `n=8`, `arr='01110110'`:
   - Leftmost `1` is at index `1`.
   - Rightmost `1` is at index `6`.
   - Free cells between indices `1` and `6` are `3` (at indices `4`, `5`, `7`).
   - Chips between indices `1` and `6` are `4` (at indices `1`, `2`, `3`, `6`).
   - Moves required = `3` (free cells) - `3` (chips that don't need to move) = `1`.

2. For `n=6`, `arr='010000'`:
   - Only one chip, no moves required.

3. For `n=6`, `arr='111111'`:
   - All chips are already contiguous, no moves required.

4. For `n=5`, `arr='10101'`:
   - Leftmost `1` is at index `0`.
   - Rightmost `1` is at index `4`.
   - Free cells between indices `0` and `4` are `2` (at indices `1`, `3`).
   - Chips between indices `0` and `4` are `2` (at indices `0`, `2`, `4`).
   - Moves required = `2` (free cells) - `1` (chip that doesn't need to move) = `2`.

5. For `n=9`, `arr='011000110'`:
   - Leftmost `1` is at index `1`.
   - Rightmost `1` is at index `7`.
   - Free cells between indices `1` and `7` are `5` (at indices `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `8`).
   - Chips between indices `1` and `7` are `3` (at indices `1`, `2`, `6`, `7`).
   - Moves required = `5` (free cells) - `2` (chips that don't need to move) = `3`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of moves required to form a contiguous block of chips. It incorrectly slices the array and counts zeros, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly calculates the number of moves required to form a contiguous block of chips. It does not properly account for the number of free cells and chips between the leftmost and rightmost chips.
