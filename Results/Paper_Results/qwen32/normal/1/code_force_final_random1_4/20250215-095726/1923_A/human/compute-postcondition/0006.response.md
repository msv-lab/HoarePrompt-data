To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is the input string with all whitespace removed.
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
- `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.

Code snippet:
```python
z = arr[x:n - y]
```

Impact:
- The variable `z` is assigned the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` up to (but not including) index `n - y`.

Let's consider the different scenarios for `x` and `y`:

1. If `x` is -1 (meaning '1' is not found in `arr`), the substring `arr[x:n - y]` would normally raise an error because negative indices are not valid in this context. However, since `x` is -1, the substring operation `arr[x:n - y]` would be invalid and typically would result in an error. But for the sake of this exercise, we'll assume that if `x` is -1, `z` would also be set to an empty string or some indication that the substring cannot be formed.

2. If `y` is -1 (meaning '1' is not found in the reversed `arr`), then `n - y` would be `n + 1`. This means the substring would go from `x` to `n + 1`, which is beyond the length of `arr`. In Python, this would result in the substring from `x` to the end of `arr`.

3. If both `x` and `y` are valid indices, then `z` would be the substring from `x` to `n - y`.

Given these considerations, the output state would be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the input string with all whitespace removed; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y` or an empty string if `x` is -1.**

In simpler terms, `z` is derived from `arr` based on the indices `x` and `n - y`, with special handling if `x` is -1.
