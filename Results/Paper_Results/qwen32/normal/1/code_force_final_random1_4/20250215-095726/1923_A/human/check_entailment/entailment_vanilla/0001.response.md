Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to move chips in such a way that they form a single contiguous block with no free cells between them. We need to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

### Key Observations
1. **Identify the Leftmost Chip**: Find the position of the leftmost chip (first '1' in the array).
2. **Identify the Rightmost Chip**: Find the position of the rightmost chip (last '1' in the array).
3. **Count Free Cells Between Chips**: Count the number of free cells ('0') between these two positions. This count represents the minimum number of operations needed because each free cell between the leftmost and rightmost chips needs to be filled by moving a chip into it.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())  # Read and flatten the input string
        x = arr.find('1')  # Find the index of the first '1'
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')  # Find the index of the last '1' by reversing the string
        z = arr[x:n - y]  # Slice the array from the first '1' to the last '1'
        print(z.count('0'))  # Count the number of '0's in this slice
```

#### Issues in the Code
1. **Incorrect Slicing**: The slicing `arr[x:n - y]` is incorrect. `n - y` does not give the correct end index for the slice. Instead, it should be `len(arr) - y - 1`.
2. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle cases where there is only one chip correctly. Although the problem guarantees at least one chip, the slicing logic should still be robust.

### Corrected Logic
Here's how the corrected logic should look:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())  # Read and flatten the input string
        x = arr.find('1')  # Find the index of the first '1'
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')  # Find the index of the last '1' by reversing the string
        z = arr[x:len(arr) - y]  # Correctly slice the array from the first '1' to the last '1'
        print(z.count('0'))  # Count the number of '0's in this slice
```

However, even with this correction, the logic still has an issue. The correct way to slice would be:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())  # Read and flatten the input string
        x = arr.find('1')  # Find the index of the first '1'
        y = arr.rfind('1')  # Find the index of the last '1' directly
        z = arr[x:y + 1]  # Correctly slice the array from the first '1' to the last '1'
        print(z.count('0'))  # Count the number of '0's in this slice
```

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect due to the improper slicing logic. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
