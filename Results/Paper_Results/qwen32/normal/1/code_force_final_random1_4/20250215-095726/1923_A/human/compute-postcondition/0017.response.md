The given code snippet reassigns `arr` to the result of removing all whitespace from the input string. This means that `arr` will no longer contain any spaces, tabs, or newline characters that were present in the original input string.

Given the initial state, `arr` was already defined as the input string with all whitespace removed. The code snippet essentially redefines `arr` using the same operation, which does not change the value of `arr` since it was already processed to remove whitespace.

Therefore, the variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged because they do not depend on the whitespace content of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 998\); `n` is the input integer; `arr` is the input string with all whitespace removed; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` to `n - y` or an empty string if `x` is -1.**
