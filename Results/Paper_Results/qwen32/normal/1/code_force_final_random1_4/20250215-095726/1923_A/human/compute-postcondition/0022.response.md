To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration and how they relate to the initial conditions and constraints provided.

### Analysis of Each Iteration:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `t`: Number of iterations (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000)
   - `n`: Length of the binary array (2 ≤ n ≤ 50)
   - `a`: Binary array consisting of 0s and 1s, with at least one 1.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each iteration:
     - Read `n` (length of the binary string).
     - Read `arr` (binary string with spaces removed).
     - Find `x`, the index of the first '1' in `arr`.
     - Find `y`, the index of the first '1' in the reversed `arr`.
     - Extract substring `z` from `arr` starting at `x` to `n - y`.
     - Print the count of '0's in `z`.

3. **State After Each Iteration:**
   - After 1 iteration: `t` decreases by 1 (becomes \( t-1 \)).
   - After 2 iterations: `t` decreases by another 1 (becomes \( t-2 \)).
   - After 3 iterations: `t` decreases by another 1 (becomes \( t-3 \)).

4. **Final State:**
   - The loop will execute `t` times.
   - After `t` iterations, `t` will be 0.

### Final Output State:
- `t` will be 0 because it has been decremented `t` times.
- `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be based on the last iteration's inputs and calculations, but these do not affect the overall final state of `t`.

### Conclusion:
The final state of the variable `t` after all iterations is 0. The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, `z`) are dependent on the specific inputs of the last iteration and do not affect the final state of `t`.

Output State: **t is 0.**
