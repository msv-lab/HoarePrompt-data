You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i is either 0 or 1. Additionally, in each test case, there is at least one element a_i equal to 1.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: t is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of binary digits (0s and 1s). For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of 0s between the first and last occurrence of the digit 1 in the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a ribbon divided into `n` cells, each either containing a chip (`1`) or being free (`0`).
- We need to move chips to form a single contiguous block with the minimum number of moves.
- A move consists of shifting a chip to the closest free cell to its left.
- The program needs to handle multiple test cases.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))
```

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Range for `z`:**
   - `x` is the index of the first `1` from the left.
   - `y` is the index of the first `1` from the right (in the reversed array), which translates to `n - y - 1` in the original array.
   - The slice `arr[x:n - y]` is incorrect because `n - y` might go out of bounds or not cover the correct range.
   
2. **Incorrect Counting of Moves:**
   - The number of moves required to form a contiguous block is not correctly calculated by simply counting zeros in the slice `z`.

### Correct Approach:
- Identify the leftmost and rightmost chips.
- Calculate the number of free cells between these two positions.
- The number of moves required will be the number of free cells minus the number of chips in between (since those chips don't need to move).

### Test Cases:
Let's consider the provided example inputs:
1. For `n=8`, `arr='01110110'`:
   - Leftmost `1` is at index `1`.
   - Rightmost `1` is at index `6`.
   - Free cells between indices `1` and `6` are `3` (at indices `4`, `5`, `7`).
   - Chips between indices `1` and `6` are `4` (at indices `1`, `2`, `3`, `6`).
   - Moves required = `3` (free cells) - `3` (chips that don't need to move) = `1`.

2. For `n=6`, `arr='010000'`:
   - Only one chip, no moves required.

3. For `n=6`, `arr='111111'`:
   - All chips are already contiguous, no moves required.

4. For `n=5`, `arr='10101'`:
   - Leftmost `1` is at index `0`.
   - Rightmost `1` is at index `4`.
   - Free cells between indices `0` and `4` are `2` (at indices `1`, `3`).
   - Chips between indices `0` and `4` are `2` (at indices `0`, `2`, `4`).
   - Moves required = `2` (free cells) - `1` (chip that doesn't need to move) = `2`.

5. For `n=9`, `arr='011000110'`:
   - Leftmost `1` is at index `1`.
   - Rightmost `1` is at index `7`.
   - Free cells between indices `1` and `7` are `5` (at indices `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `8`).
   - Chips between indices `1` and `7` are `3` (at indices `1`, `2`, `6`, `7`).
   - Moves required = `5` (free cells) - `2` (chips that don't need to move) = `3`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of moves required to form a contiguous block of chips. It incorrectly slices the array and counts zeros, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly calculates the number of moves required to form a contiguous block of chips. It does not properly account for the number of free cells and chips between the leftmost and rightmost chips.
