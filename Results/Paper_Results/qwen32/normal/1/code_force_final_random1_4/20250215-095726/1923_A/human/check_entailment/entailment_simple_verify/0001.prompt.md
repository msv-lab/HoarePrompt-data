You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i is either 0 or 1. Additionally, in each test case, there is at least one element a_i equal to 1.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))

        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: t is 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to move chips in such a way that they form a single contiguous block with no free cells between them. We need to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

### Key Observations
1. **Identify the Leftmost Chip**: Find the position of the leftmost chip (first '1' in the array).
2. **Identify the Rightmost Chip**: Find the position of the rightmost chip (last '1' in the array).
3. **Count Free Cells Between Chips**: Count the number of free cells ('0') between these two positions. This count represents the minimum number of operations needed because each free cell between the leftmost and rightmost chips needs to be filled by moving a chip into it.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())  # Read and flatten the input string
        x = arr.find('1')  # Find the index of the first '1'
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')  # Find the index of the last '1' by reversing the string
        z = arr[x:n - y]  # Slice the array from the first '1' to the last '1'
        print(z.count('0'))  # Count the number of '0's in this slice
```

#### Issues in the Code
1. **Incorrect Slicing**: The slicing `arr[x:n - y]` is incorrect. `n - y` does not give the correct end index for the slice. Instead, it should be `len(arr) - y - 1`.
2. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle cases where there is only one chip correctly. Although the problem guarantees at least one chip, the slicing logic should still be robust.

### Corrected Logic
Here's how the corrected logic should look:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())  # Read and flatten the input string
        x = arr.find('1')  # Find the index of the first '1'
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')  # Find the index of the last '1' by reversing the string
        z = arr[x:len(arr) - y]  # Correctly slice the array from the first '1' to the last '1'
        print(z.count('0'))  # Count the number of '0's in this slice
```

However, even with this correction, the logic still has an issue. The correct way to slice would be:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())  # Read and flatten the input string
        x = arr.find('1')  # Find the index of the first '1'
        y = arr.rfind('1')  # Find the index of the last '1' directly
        z = arr[x:y + 1]  # Correctly slice the array from the first '1' to the last '1'
        print(z.count('0'))  # Count the number of '0's in this slice
```

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect due to the improper slicing logic. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
