The code appends `current_year` to the `results` list. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `test`, `n`, `a`, `current_year`, and `next_year` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6); `test` is the third tuple in `test_cases`; `results` is a list containing three elements, the first being the LCM of the first tuple's list `a`, the second being the LCM of the list `a` from the tuple `test`, and the third being `current_year`; `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases`; `current_year` is the LCM of all elements in `a`; `next_year` is equal to `current_year`.**
