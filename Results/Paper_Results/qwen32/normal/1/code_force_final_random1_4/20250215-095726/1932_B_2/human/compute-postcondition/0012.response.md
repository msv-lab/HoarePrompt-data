To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the context and how the variable `year` is derived from the given initial state. The initial state provides us with the following:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 (though it's not clear how this is used in the given code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `year` is the final value after all iterations of the loop have completed.

However, the provided code snippet only contains a `print(year)` statement without any loop or logic that modifies `year`. This implies that `year` must be defined or initialized somewhere outside of the provided snippet, and its value is not altered within the snippet itself.

Given the lack of additional context or the logic that sets `year`, we can only infer that `year` holds some value that was determined prior to the execution of the `print(year)` statement.

Therefore, the output will simply be the value of `year` as it stands at the time of the print statement.

Output: **year (where year is the final value after all iterations of the loop have completed)**
