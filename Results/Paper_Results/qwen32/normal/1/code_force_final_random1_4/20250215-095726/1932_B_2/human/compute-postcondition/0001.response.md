To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the only variable directly involved in controlling the loop is `t`.

Given the problem statement, `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This means that `t` is already in a valid state to ensure the loop will execute at least once because `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the given constraints.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000**
