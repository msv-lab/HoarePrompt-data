The code snippet provided initializes the variable `year` to 0. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the only change in the state is the assignment of `year` to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 999, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `year` is 0.**
