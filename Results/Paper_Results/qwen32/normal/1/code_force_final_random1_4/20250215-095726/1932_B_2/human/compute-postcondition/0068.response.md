Output State: **The program returns a list `results` where each element is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the integers in the corresponding tuple's list from `test_cases`.**

This means that for each tuple in `test_cases`, the LCM of the integers in the list part of that tuple has been calculated and stored in the `results` list. The final output is the entire `results` list containing these LCM values.
