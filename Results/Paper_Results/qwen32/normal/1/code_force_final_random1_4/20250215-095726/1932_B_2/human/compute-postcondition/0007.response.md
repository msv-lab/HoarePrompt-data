The only variable in the loop head is `ai`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state and how the loop progresses.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one integer.
- `year` is the first element of `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ai` would have taken the value of the last element processed from the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in the list `a` that `ai` can take.

Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `ai` was the `k`-th element of the list `a`. In the next iteration, `ai` should be the `(k+1)`-th element of the list `a`.

Since `year` is defined as the first element of `a`, it does not change throughout the iterations. The other variables `t` and `n` are not part of the loop head and thus remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `ai` now points to the next element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two integers; `year` is the first element of `a`; `ai` is the second element of `a`**
