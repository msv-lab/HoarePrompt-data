Output State: **The program returns the result of `func_3(2, l)`**

This means that the value of `l` is the output of the function `func_3` called with arguments `2` and the current value of `l`. Since the exact implementation of `func_3` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific numerical value of `l` after the function call. However, we know that the function `func_3` was applied to `2` and the initial value of `l`, and the result of this function call is what gets returned.
