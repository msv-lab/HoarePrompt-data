You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and k is a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value.
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        
        k = k - i + 1
        
        l = func_3(c, l)
        
    #State: 
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and `k`, a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value. Depending on certain conditions related to `k` and `n`, the function may return different results. Specifically, it could return a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`, or the result of calling other functions (`func_2` or `func_3`) with specific arguments.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`.

Case_2: The program returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`, where `c` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer representing half of the original required Manhattan value and less than `i - 1`, and `l` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`.

Case_3: The program returns the value of `l`, which is the result of `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is 2.

Case_4: The program returns the result of `func_2(2, k, l)`

Case_5: The program returns the result of `func_3(2, l)`

Case_6: The program returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
