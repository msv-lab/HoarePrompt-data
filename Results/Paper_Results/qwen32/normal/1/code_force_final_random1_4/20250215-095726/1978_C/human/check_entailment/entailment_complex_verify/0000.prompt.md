You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

It processes these inputs and returns either a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`, or the result of calling other functions (`func_2` or `func_3`) with specific arguments, depending on the values of `n` and `k`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c and k are non-negative integers, and l is a list of integers such that c and k are within the bounds that allow valid indexing into l without causing an out-of-range error. Specifically, c and c+k should be less than the length of l.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` takes no direct input parameters. It retrieves values `n` and `k` from `func_4`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is zero, it prints 'NO' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it uses these values to generate a list `l` via `func_1(n, k)` and then passes `l` to `func_5`. The function always returns `None`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that the Manhattan value \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \) equals \( k \).
- If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".
- If such a permutation exists, we should output "Yes" followed by the permutation.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of several functions, and the main logic seems to be in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. Here's a summary of what these functions do:

- **`func_1(n, k)`**: This function generates a permutation of length \( n \) with a Manhattan value of \( k \). It divides \( k \) by 2 and iteratively adjusts the permutation until the required Manhattan value is achieved.
- **`func_2(c, k, l)`**: This function swaps elements in the permutation to adjust the Manhattan value.
- **`func_3(c, l)`**: This function swaps elements in the permutation to adjust the Manhattan value.
- **`func_4()`**: This function reads input values \( n \) and \( k \), checks if \( k \) is even, and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for the given \( n \).
- **`func_5(l)`**: This function prints the permutation.
- **`func_6()`**: This function orchestrates the process by reading input, checking conditions, and calling other functions to generate and print the permutation.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Even Check for \( k \)**: The program checks if \( k \) is even (`if k % 2`). According to the problem statement, \( k \) can be any integer between 0 and \( 10^{12} \). However, the Manhattan value is always even because it is the sum of absolute differences, which are always even when summed over an even number of terms. Therefore, this check is unnecessary and might incorrectly reject valid inputs where \( k \) is odd.
2. **Maximum Manhattan Value Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value as \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \) for odd \( n \) and \( \frac{n^2}{2} \) for even \( n \). This calculation seems correct based on the problem constraints.
3. **Permutation Generation Logic**: The logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` is complex and involves swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value. While the logic seems to be designed to work, it is not immediately clear that it handles all edge cases correctly without further analysis or testing.

### Testing Edge Cases:
To verify the correctness of the program, let's consider some edge cases:

1. **\( n = 1 \), \( k = 0 \)**: The only permutation is `[1]`, and its Manhattan value is 0. The program should output "Yes\n1".
2. **\( n = 1 \), \( k = 1 \)**: No permutation exists because the Manhattan value is always 0 for \( n = 1 \). The program should output "No".
3. **\( n = 2 \), \( k = 0 \)**: The only permutation is `[1, 2]`, and its Manhattan value is 0. The program should output "Yes\n1 2".
4. **\( n = 2 \), \( k = 2 \)**: The permutation `[2, 1]` has a Manhattan value of 2. The program should output "Yes\n2 1".
5. **\( n = 2 \), \( k = 1 \)**: No permutation exists because the Manhattan value is either 0 or 2. The program should output "No".

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and testing of edge cases, the program seems to handle some cases correctly but fails to handle cases where \( k \) is odd, which is a critical issue since the Manhattan value is always even. Additionally, the complexity of the permutation generation logic makes it difficult to verify correctness without extensive testing.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly rejects valid inputs where \( k \) is odd, even though the Manhattan value is always even. This makes the program incorrect for at least one potential case.
