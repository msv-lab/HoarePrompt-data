Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is a non-negative integer equal to the initial `k` (unchanged), `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `i` is -1, `c` is increased by 1. If `k` equals 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(2, l)`. If `k < i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`. Otherwise, none of these conditions are met and the program does not return yet.**
