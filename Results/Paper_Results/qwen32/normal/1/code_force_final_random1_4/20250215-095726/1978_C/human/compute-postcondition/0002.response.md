In this case, the initial state provides information about the variables `n` and `k`, but the `print` statement does not depend on these variables. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `n` is a positive integer, but it explicitly states that the current value of `n` is 0. This seems contradictory, but since the print statement does not use `n`, this detail is irrelevant to the output.
2. The initial state also mentions that `k` is a non-negative integer as returned by `func_4()`, but again, the print statement does not use `k`, so this detail is also irrelevant to the output.
3. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
