To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify whether it correctly solves the problem of finding a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \), or determining that no such permutation exists.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that the Manhattan value \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| = k \).
   - If no such permutation exists, the program should output "No".

2. **Key Points of the Program:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - It uses a function `func_4` to check if \( k \) is even and if \( k \) is within the possible range for the Manhattan value.
   - The main logic for constructing the permutation is in `func_1`, which recursively constructs the permutation by swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - `func_2` and `func_3` are helper functions used in `func_1` to perform specific swaps.
   - `func_5` prints the permutation if found.
   - `func_6` ties everything together by reading input, checking feasibility, and calling the necessary functions to construct and print the permutation.

3. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program assumes that the Manhattan value must be even. This assumption is incorrect because the Manhattan value can be odd for certain permutations.
   - The calculation of `max_k` is correct for the maximum possible Manhattan value, but the program incorrectly restricts the solution to only even values of \( k \).
   - The logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` is complex and may not cover all cases correctly, especially for odd values of \( k \).

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because it incorrectly assumes that the Manhattan value must be even and does not handle all possible values of \( k \). Therefore, the program will fail for test cases where \( k \) is odd and a valid permutation exists.

**Correctness: False**
