To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic and functionality step by step:

### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires finding a permutation of length `n` such that its Manhattan value equals `k`. The Manhattan value is defined as the sum of absolute differences between each element in the permutation and its position index.

### Key Points:
1. **Permutation**: An array of `n` distinct integers from `1` to `n`.
2. **Manhattan Value**: Sum of `|p_i - i|` for `i` from `1` to `n`.
3. **Constraints**: `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `0 <= k <= 10^12`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **func_4()**: 
   - Reads `n` and `k` from input.
   - Checks if `k` is odd. If yes, returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value is always even.
   - Computes the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`.
     - For odd `n`: `(n^2 - 1) / 2`
     - For even `n`: `n^2 / 2`
   - If `k` exceeds this maximum, returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, returns `(n, k)`.

2. **func_1(n, k)**:
   - Divides `k` by `2` (since the Manhattan value is always even).
   - Initializes a list `l` with elements from `1` to `n`.
   - Iterates from `n` down to `1` in steps of `-2`.
   - Adjusts `l` to increase the Manhattan value until it reaches `k` or determines that it's impossible.

3. **func_2(c, k, l)**:
   - Swaps elements in `l` to adjust the Manhattan value by `k`.

4. **func_3(c, l)**:
   - Swaps elements in `l` to adjust the Manhattan value by `c`.

5. **func_5(l)**:
   - Prints "YES" followed by the permutation `l`.

6. **func_6()**:
   - Calls `func_4()` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is `0`, prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, calls `func_1(n, k)` to get the permutation and prints it using `func_5(l)`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic for Maximum Manhattan Value**:
   - The formula for the maximum Manhattan value seems incorrect. It should be `(n^2 - n) / 2` for both odd and even `n`.
   - This is because the maximum deviation occurs when the permutation is reversed, leading to `|n-1| + |n-2| + ... + |1-n|`.

2. **Adjusting the Permutation**:
   - The logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` is complex and may not correctly achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - There is no clear explanation or proof that these functions will always produce a valid permutation with the exact Manhattan value `k`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the logic for calculating the maximum Manhattan value and the complexity of adjusting the permutation, the program is likely incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
