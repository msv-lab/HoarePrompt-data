Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) that is not equal to 0; `l` is a list starting with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 2 to `n-1` (or `[n-1]` if `n == 1`); `i` is `i`; `x` is `n-1`. If `1 + i > k`, the program returns `[0]` if `n == 1`, otherwise it returns `[n-1]` if `n > 1`. If `1 + i <= k`, the program does not return and continues with the existing state of variables.**
