Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). The function has three cases for its return value: Case_1 and Case_2 both return the tuple (0, 0); Case_3 returns the tuple (n, k) if `k` is an even integer.**
