The code snippet assigns new values to `n`, `m`, and `k` based on user input. The initial values of these variables (`n=5, m=5, k=6`) are overwritten. The other variables (`i=5, a=[1, 2, 3], b=[2, 3, 4], newk=3, t=2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i=5, a=[1, 2, 3], b=[2, 3, 4], newk=3, t=2`**
