Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the three integers read from the input where `k` must be at least 1; `i` is 1; `aOnes` is 0; `t` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`. Additionally, if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0. Either `i` is not in `a`, or `i` is not in `b`, or both. It is not the case that `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk` unless `bOnes` has been updated to 1.**
