Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the three integers read from the input where `k` must be at least 1; `i` is `k - 1`; `t` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then if `aOnes` was initially less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is set to 1 and `bOnes` remains 0; otherwise, `aOnes` remains 0 and `bOnes` is set to 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is set to 1; otherwise, `aOnes` remains 0. Similarly, if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is set to 1; otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0. Additionally, if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1.`**
