Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 · min(n, m), a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6. The sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 4 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    aOnes = 0
    bOnes = 0
    newk = k // 2
    i = 1
    while i <= k:
        if i in a and i in b:
            if aOnes < bOnes:
                aOnes += 1
            else:
                bOnes += 1
        elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
            aOnes += 1
        elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
            bOnes += 1
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` and `bOnes` are the counts reflecting the conditions met during the loop iterations. If `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, the conditions specified in the if part are met. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n=5, m=5, k=6, i=5, a=[1, 2, 3], b=[2, 3, 4], newk=3, t has been incremented by 1. If aOnes and bOnes are both equal to newk (which is 3), then aOnes and bOnes remain equal to newk. Otherwise, aOnes remains 1 and bOnes remains 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `aOnes` is `X`, and `bOnes` is `Y`. If both `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, then the condition in the if statement is true. Otherwise, the condition in the if statement is false, indicating that it is not the case that both `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
