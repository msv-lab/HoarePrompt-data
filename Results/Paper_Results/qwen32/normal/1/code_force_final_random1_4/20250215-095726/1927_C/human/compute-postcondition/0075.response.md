Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the three integers read from the input where `k` must be at least 1; `i` is 1; `aOnes` is 0; `bOnes` is 1; `t` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`. Additionally, `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`.**

Explanation: The value of `bOnes` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
