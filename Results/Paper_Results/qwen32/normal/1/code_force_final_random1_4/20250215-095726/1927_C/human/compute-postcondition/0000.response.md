In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are defined within each test case and are not part of the loop head. Therefore, the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 since the range function in Python will generate numbers from 0 up to, but not including, the specified value. Given that `t` is already constrained to be between 1 and \(10^4\), no adjustment is needed for `t` itself to ensure the loop executes.

However, to match the format requested, we should specify that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
