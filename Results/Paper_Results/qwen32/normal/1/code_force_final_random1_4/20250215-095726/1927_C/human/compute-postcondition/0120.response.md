Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i=1`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers from the new input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `t=2`, `aOnes=0`, `bOnes=0`. Additionally, `i` is present in both `a` and `b`. The number of ones in `a` (`aOnes`) is less than the number of ones in `b` (`bOnes`).**
