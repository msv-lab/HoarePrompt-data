Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the three integers read from the input where `k` must be at least 1; `i` is 1; `aOnes` is 1; `bOnes` is 0; `t` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `newk` is `k // 2`. Additionally, either `i` is not in `a`, or `i` is not in `b`, or both. `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`.**

Explanation: The value of `aOnes` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
