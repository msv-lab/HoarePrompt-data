Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i=1`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers from the new input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `t=2`, `aOnes=0`, `bOnes=0`. Additionally, either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. It is not the case that `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`. Furthermore, either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is greater than `newk`.**
