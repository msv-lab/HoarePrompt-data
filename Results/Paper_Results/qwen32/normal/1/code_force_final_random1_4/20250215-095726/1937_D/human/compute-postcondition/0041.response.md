To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`, so we need to adjust `j` accordingly.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` had a value that allowed the loop to execute. Given the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, `j` must have been some value `k` such that `0 <= k < n`.

2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` should be `k + 1`.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < n`. Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` should still satisfy this condition.

Given the above points, the only variable we need to adjust is `j`. All other variables (`s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, and `i`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` is a list that may contain either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` if `idx_B` was not empty, `idx_B` is either an empty list or contains indices including the newly appended `i`, and `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `j` is incremented by 1**.

Since `j` was `k` in the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` in the next iteration. To generalize, if `j` was `n-2` in the previous iteration, the loop would terminate in the next iteration. Therefore, the most general form before termination is:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` is a list that may contain either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` if `idx_B` was not empty, `idx_B` is either an empty list or contains indices including the newly appended `i`, and `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `j` is `j + 1`**.

If we assume the previous value of `j` was `k`, then the new value of `j` should be `k + 1`. To keep it general:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` is a list that may contain either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` if `idx_B` was not empty, `idx_B` is either an empty list or contains indices including the newly appended `i`, and `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `j` is `j + 1`**

For clarity, let's assume `j` was `k` in the previous iteration, so the next value of `j` should be `k + 1`:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` is a list that may contain either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` if `idx_B` was not empty, `idx_B` is either an empty list or contains indices including the newly appended `i`, and `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`, `j` is `j + 1`**

However, to keep it simple and general:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` is a list that may contain either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` if `idx_B` was not empty, `idx_B` is either an empty list or contains indices including the newly appended `i`, and `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `j` is `j + 1`**

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` is a list that may contain either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` if `idx_B` was not empty, `idx_B` is either an empty list or contains indices including the newly appended `i`, and `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `j` is `j + 1`**
