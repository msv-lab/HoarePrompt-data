The code appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. The values of `s`, `n`, `i`, and the elements of `idx_A` remain unchanged. The only change is that `A` now includes the new element `x`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`; `A` has a new element `x` appended to it.**
