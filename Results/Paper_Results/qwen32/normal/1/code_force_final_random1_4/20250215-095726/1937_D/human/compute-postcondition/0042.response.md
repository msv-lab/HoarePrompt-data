The code snippet provided updates the value of the variable `i`. The value of `i` is calculated as `n - 1 - j`. The values of `n` and `j` are given in the initial state, and `i` is recalculated based on these values. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Given that `i` was previously defined as `n - 1 - j`, and the code reassigns `i` using the same formula, the value of `i` will be updated accordingly. Since `j` is incremented by 1 (`j = j + 1`), the new value of `i` will be one less than its previous value.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` is a list that may contain either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` if `idx_B` was not empty, `idx_B` is either an empty list or contains indices including the newly appended `i`, and `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`, `j` is `j + 1`.**
