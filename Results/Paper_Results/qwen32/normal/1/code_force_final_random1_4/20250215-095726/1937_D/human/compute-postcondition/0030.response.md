In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `j`, and it iterates over the range from `0` to `n-1`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least `1`, because `range(0, n)` will generate at least one value (`0`) if `n` is greater than `0`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>';
- `n` is the length of the string `s`;
- `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`;
- `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`;
- `B` is an empty list;
- `idx_B` is an empty list.

The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `n`. Specifically, `n` must be greater than `0` for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list**
