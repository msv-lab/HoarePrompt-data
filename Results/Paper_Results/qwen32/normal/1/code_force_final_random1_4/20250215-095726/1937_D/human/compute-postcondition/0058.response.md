The given code snippet initializes a variable `l` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`). Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the addition of the new variable `l`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `l` is 0.**
