To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
```

Hereâ€™s what happens:
- `A` is an empty list, so `len(A)` is 0. This means `A[len(A) - 1]` would normally cause an `IndexError` because there is no element at index -1. However, since `A` is empty, we need to assume there's some context or prior code that ensures this doesn't happen, or we interpret this as an undefined behavior. For the sake of this problem, let's assume there's some predefined value or context that allows this operation to proceed without error.
- `idx_A` is a non-empty list, so `len(idx_A)` is a positive integer.
- `i` is the current index in the string `s`, and the current character at index `i` in `s` is '>'.
- `idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]` refers to the last element in the list `idx_A`.

Given these points, let's assume `A` has some predefined value at index -1 for the sake of calculation. Since `A` is empty, we'll assume `A[-1]` is some placeholder value, say `0` for simplicity.

Let's denote:
- `A[-1]` as `0` (since `A` is empty, we assume this for calculation purposes).
- `idx_A[-1]` as `last_idx_A` (the last element in `idx_A`).

Then the equation simplifies to:
```python
x = 0 + (i - last_idx_A) * len(idx_A)
x = (i - last_idx_A) * len(idx_A)
```

So, the value of `x` is `(i - last_idx_A) * len(idx_A)`.

Since `A` remains an empty list and `idx_A` remains unchanged, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is a non-empty list, `x` is `(i - last_idx_A) * len(idx_A)`**.
