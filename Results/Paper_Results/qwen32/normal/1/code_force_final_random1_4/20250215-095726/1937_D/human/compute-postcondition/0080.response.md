The code modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from its current value.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `b`. All other variables retain their original values or conditions.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `l` is 0; `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`; At the current index `i`, `s[i]` is '>'; `l` is not less than `r`; `r` is greater than 0; `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`.**
