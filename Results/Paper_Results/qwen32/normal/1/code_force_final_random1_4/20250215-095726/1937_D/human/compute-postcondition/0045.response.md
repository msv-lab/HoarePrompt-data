Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` now contains the previously existing elements plus the new element `x`; `idx_B` is either an empty list or contains indices including the newly appended `i`; `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`; `j` is `j + 1`; `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len_idx_B`.**

Explanation: The variable `B` has been updated to include a new element `x`. All other variables retain their previous states and values.
