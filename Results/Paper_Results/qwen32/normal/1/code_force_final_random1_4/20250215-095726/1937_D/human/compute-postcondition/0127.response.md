To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
- `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
- `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.
- `i` is defined as `i_end + 1`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

From the given information, we know:
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `i` is defined as `i_end + 1`. However, `i_end` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `i` without additional information about `i_end`.

Since we do not have a specific value for `i_end`, we can only express the output in terms of `n` and `i`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be `n - i`, where `i` is `i_end + 1`.

Output: **n - i (where i is i_end + 1)**
