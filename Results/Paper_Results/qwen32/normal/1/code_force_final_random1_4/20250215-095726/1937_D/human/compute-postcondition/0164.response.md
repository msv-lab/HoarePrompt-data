The given code snippet modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `B[x]` from it. Here's the updated state:

- `b` was originally `B[r - 1]`.
- Now, `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[x]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 2`; `a` is `A[l]`; `x` is `r - (l + 2)`; `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x]`.**
