The given code snippet assigns the value of `B[r]` to the variable `b`. None of the other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `b` is now assigned the value stored at index `r` of the list `B`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `l` is greater than 0; `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1; at the current index `i`, `s[i]` is not '>'; `l` is less than or equal to `r`; `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`; `b` is `B[r]`.**
