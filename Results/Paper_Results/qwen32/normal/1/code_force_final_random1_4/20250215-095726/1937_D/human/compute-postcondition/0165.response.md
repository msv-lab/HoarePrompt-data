The given code modifies the value of `b`. Let's break down the changes:

The original value of `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x]`.

The new value of `b` is calculated as:
\[ b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) \]

Substituting the original value of `b` into the equation, we get:
\[ b = (B[r - 1] - B[x]) - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) \]

This means the value of `b` is updated based on the difference between the indices in `idx_B` and the value of `x`.

Other variables (`s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `i`, `a`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 2`; `a` is `A[l]`; `x` is `r - (l + 2)`; `b` is `(B[r - 1] - B[x]) - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`**.
