The code appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. The values of `s`, `n`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged except that `A` now includes the new element `x` at the end.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i_prev + 2`; `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + ((i_prev + 2) - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`; `A` now includes `x` as its last element.**
