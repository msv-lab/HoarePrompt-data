To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how the variables are defined based on the string `s` and its components.

### Initial State Recap:
- `s`: A string consisting of '<' and '>'.
- `n`: Length of the string `s` (greater than 0).
- `A`: Computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A`: Indices where '>' appears in `s`.
- `B`: Computed values based on the positions of '<' in `s`.
- `idx_B`: Indices where '<' appears in `s`.
- `i`: Defined as `i_end + 2`.
- `a`: Calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
- `b`: Updated based on the condition `l - r <= 0`:
  - If `l - r <= 0`, then `b = A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
  - Otherwise, `b = A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

#### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `a`**:
   - `a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`
   - Here, `B[r - 1]` is a precomputed value based on the positions of '<' in `s`.
   - `idx_B[r - 1]` is the index of the `(r-1)`-th occurrence of '<' in `s`.
   - `i` is defined as `i_end + 2`.
   - `r` is an index related to the computation of `B`.

2. **Calculate `b`**:
   - Depending on the condition `l - r <= 0`:
     - If `l - r <= 0`, then `b = A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
     - Otherwise, `b = A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
   - Here, `A[l - 1]` and `A[l - r - 1]` are precomputed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
   - `idx_A[l - 1]` and `idx_A[l - r - 1]` are the indices of the `(l-1)`-th and `(l-r-1)`-th occurrences of '>' in `s`.
   - `i` is defined as `i_end + 2`.
   - `l` and `r` are indices related to the computation of `A` and `B`.

3. **Final Expression**:
   - The expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.
   - This involves doubling the values of `a` and `b`, and adding the difference between the length of the string `s` and `i`.

### Final Output Description:
Given the complexity and the dependencies on specific indices and precomputed values (`A` and `B`), we cannot provide a numerical value without knowing the exact string `s` and the values of `l` and `r`. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) (where a and b are computed based on the positions of '>' and '<' in the string s, n is the length of s, and i is defined as i_end + 2)**
