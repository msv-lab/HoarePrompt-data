The given code snippet assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `b`. This means that the value at index `l - 1` in the list `A` is now stored in `b`.

Here's the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `s` remains a string consisting of '<' and '>'.
- `n` remains the length of the string `s` and is greater than 0.
- `A` remains unchanged, containing computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` remains unchanged, containing all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
- `B` remains unchanged, containing values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
- `idx_B` remains unchanged, containing all indices where '<' appears in `s`.
- `i` remains `i_end + 1`.
- `r` remains decreased by 1.
- `a` remains `B[r]`.
- `b` is now assigned the value `A[l - 1]`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 1`; `r` is decreased by 1; `a` is `B[r]`; `b` is `A[l - 1]`.**
