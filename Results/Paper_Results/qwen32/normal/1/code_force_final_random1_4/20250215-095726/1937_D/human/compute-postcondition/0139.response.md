To determine what will be printed by the `print(i + 1, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

- `s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`.
- `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
- `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`.
- `i` is `i_end + 1`.
- `r` is decreased by 1.

From the given information, we know that `i` is set to `i_end + 1`. However, `i_end` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `i`. 

However, we can express the output in terms of `i_end`.

Given `i = i_end + 1`, the expression `i + 1` becomes `(i_end + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `i_end + 2`.

Since `end=' '` specifies that the print statement should end with a space instead of a newline, the output will be the value of `i + 1` followed by a space.

Therefore, the output can be described as:

Output: **i_end + 2 ** (where i_end is the last index used in the computation of `i`)
