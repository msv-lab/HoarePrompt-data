The given code snippet updates the value of `i` based on the current value of `n` and `j`. The other variables (`s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`) remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code, which they are not in this case.

Given the initial state, `i` is updated to `n - 1 - j`. This means the value of `i` changes from `n - 2 - j` to `n - 1 - j`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`, `B` contains either a single element [0] if `idx_B` was initially empty, or includes a new element `x` followed by 0 if `idx_B` was not empty, or includes the previously existing elements plus the new element `x` where `x` is `B_last + (idx_B_last - i) * len_idx_B` if `idx_B` was not empty, `idx_B` contains all its previous elements plus the newly appended `i` if `s[i]` is '<', `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `j` is `j + 1`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `i` has been updated to `n - 1 - j`, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
