Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `l` is 0; `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1; `a` is `B[r]` if `r` is 0, otherwise `a` remains unchanged; `b` is updated to its previous value plus `(i - idx_A[-1]) * (r + 1)` if `r` is not 0. Additionally, `l` is greater than `r`.**
