To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state and analyze the variables involved:

1. **String `s`**: It consists of '<' and '>' characters.
2. **Length `n`**: Length of the string `s` and is greater than 0.
3. **Lists `A` and `B`**: These lists contain computed values based on the positions of '>' and '<' in `s`, respectively.
4. **Lists `idx_A` and `idx_B`**: These lists contain the indices where '>' and '<' appear in `s`, respectively.
5. **Variable `i`**: Defined as `i_end + 1`.
6. **Variable `a`**: Defined as `A[l]`.
7. **Variable `x`**: Defined as `r - (l + 2)`.
8. **Variable `b`**: Initially defined as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is updated to `(B[r - 1] - B[x]) - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
```

Let's analyze the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`:

- **`a * 2`**: Since `a` is `A[l]`, this term represents twice the value at index `l` in list `A`.
- **`b * 2`**: This term represents twice the value of `b` after any updates based on the conditions involving `x`.
- **`i + 1`**: This term represents the value of `i` plus one, where `i` is defined as `i_end + 1`.

Without specific values for `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, `i_end`, and `x`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output Description:
The `print` statement outputs the result of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`, where:
- `a` is the value at index `l` in list `A`.
- `b` is either `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` or `(B[r - 1] - B[x]) - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` depending on whether `x` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` is `i_end + 1`.

Thus, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where a = A[l], b is determined by the conditions involving x, and i = i_end + 1)**
