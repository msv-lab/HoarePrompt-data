Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `l` is less than `r`; `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`; At the current index `i`, `s[i]` is '>'; `a` is `A[l]`; `x` is `r - (l + 2)` and `x` is greater than or equal to 0; `b` is `B[r - 1]`.**
