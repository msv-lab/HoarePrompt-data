The given code snippet modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `B[r - l]` from its current value. Here's the updated state:

- `s` remains a string consisting of '<' and '>'.
- `n` remains the length of the string `s` and is still greater than 0.
- `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged as they contain computed values and indices based on the positions of '>' in `s`.
- `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged as they contain computed values and indices based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`.
- `i` remains `i_end + 1`.
- `r` remains decreased by 1.
- `a` remains assigned the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- `b` is now `b - B[r - l]`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0; `A` contains computed values based on the positions of '>' in `s`; `idx_A` contains all indices where '>' appears in `s`; `B` contains values computed based on the positions of '<' characters in `s`; `idx_B` contains all indices where '<' appears in `s`; `i` is `i_end + 1`; `r` is decreased by 1; `a` is assigned the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`; `b` is assigned the value of `b - B[r - l]`.**
