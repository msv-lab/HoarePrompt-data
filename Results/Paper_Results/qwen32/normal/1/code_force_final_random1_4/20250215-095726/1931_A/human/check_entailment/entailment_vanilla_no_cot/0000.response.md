Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

The problem requires us to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given number `n` (where `3 <= n <= 78`). The approach taken by the program is to categorize the possible values of `n` into three ranges and construct the word accordingly:

1. If `n > 52`, it constructs the word using `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
2. If `52 >= n > 26`, it constructs the word using `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
3. If `n <= 26`, it constructs the word using `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

Let's verify if these conditions and constructions are correct:

- For `n > 52`: 
  - The maximum value for `n` is 78.
  - The first letter can be any letter from 'd' to 'z' (since 'd' corresponds to 4 and 'z' corresponds to 26, thus 'd' corresponds to 4 + 26 + 26 = 56).
  - The construction `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` is correct because it ensures that the first letter is at least 'd', and the remaining two letters are 'z', which is the lexicographically smallest configuration for larger sums.

- For `52 >= n > 26`:
  - The first letter is fixed as 'a'.
  - The second letter can be any letter from 'b' to 'z' (since 'b' corresponds to 2 and 'z' corresponds to 26, thus 'b' corresponds to 1 + 2 + 26 = 29).
  - The third letter is fixed as 'z'.
  - The construction `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` is correct because it ensures that the first letter is 'a', the second letter is at least 'b', and the third letter is 'z'.

- For `n <= 26`:
  - The first two letters are fixed as 'a'.
  - The third letter can be any letter from 'a' to 'x' (since 'a' corresponds to 1 and 'x' corresponds to 24, thus 'a' corresponds to 1 + 1 + 1 = 3).
  - The construction `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` is correct because it ensures that the first two letters are 'a', and the third letter is the smallest possible letter that makes the sum equal to `n`.

Given the above analysis, the program seems to correctly handle all possible values of `n` within the specified range and constructs the lexicographically smallest word accordingly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
