To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is the integer value of the user input
- `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
- `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` is now `i + 1`)
- `word` is an empty string

Code Snippet:
```python
word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
```

The code modifies the `word` variable by appending a substring from `alphabet` and the string `'zz'`. Specifically, it appends the character at index `n - 53` of `alphabet` followed by `'zz'`.

Given that `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', the valid indices range from 0 to 25. Therefore, `n - 53` should be within this range for the code to work correctly. However, since `n` is the integer value of user input and there is no constraint provided on `n` other than it being an integer, we must assume `n` is chosen such that `n - 53` results in a valid index.

Let's denote the character at index `n - 53` in `alphabet` as `char`. Thus, `word` will become `char + 'zz'`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the integer value of the user input, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is `i + 1`, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`**

In natural language: 
- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100.
- `n` retains its value as the integer input by the user.
- `alphabet` remains the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `word` is updated to the character at position `n - 53` in `alphabet` followed by 'zz'.
