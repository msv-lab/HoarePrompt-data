The code appends the string `'aa'` followed by the character at index `n - 3` from the string `alphabet` to the variable `word`. Given that `n` is less than or equal to 26, `n - 3` will be a valid index for the string `alphabet`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `word` was initially an empty string. After the operation, `word` becomes `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `alphabet` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the integer value of the user input and `n` is less than or equal to 26, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `word` is the string `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]'**.
