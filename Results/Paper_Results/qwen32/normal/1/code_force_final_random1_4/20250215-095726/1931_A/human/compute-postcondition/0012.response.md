Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the integer value of the user input, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If `n` > 52, `word` is the string consisting of the character at position `(n - 53) % 26` in `alphabet` followed by 'zz'. If 26 < `n` <= 52, `word` is the string 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'. If `n` <= 26, `word` is the string 'aa' + `alphabet[n - 3]`.**
