### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided solution. Let's break down the logic and verify it against the problem requirements.

#### Case Analysis:
1. **Case 1: \( n > 52 \)**
   - The formula used is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
   - This formula is incorrect because it does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. For example, when \( n = 78 \), the formula results in 'z' + 'zz' = 'zzz', which is not the smallest possible word. The correct smallest word for \( n = 78 \) should be 'rzz', as it is lexicographically smaller.

2. **Case 2: \( 26 < n \leq 52 \)**
   - The formula used is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - This formula is also incorrect. For example, when \( n = 52 \), the formula results in 'a' + 'y' + 'z' = 'ayz', which is not the smallest possible word. The correct smallest word for \( n = 52 \) should be 'czz'.

3. **Case 3: \( n \leq 26 \)**
   - The formula used is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
   - This formula is correct for the specific case where \( n \leq 26 \). For example, when \( n = 3 \), the formula results in 'aa' + 'a' = 'aaa', which is correct.

### General Approach:
To construct the lexicographically smallest word, we need to ensure that we start with the smallest possible letters and incrementally increase them to reach the desired sum \( n \).

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Initialize the word with 'aaa'** (which corresponds to the sum 3).
2. **Incrementally adjust the letters** to reach the sum \( n \):
   - Start by increasing the third letter until the sum reaches or exceeds \( n \).
   - If the sum exceeds \( n \), adjust the second letter and then the first letter accordingly.

### Verification with Annotated Code:
The annotated code does not reflect the correct logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest word. Instead, it uses hardcoded formulas that do not guarantee the correct result for all values of \( n \).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided solution is incorrect as it does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word for all values of \( n \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
