Let's break down the given initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed by the `print(word)` statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `n` is the integer value of user input.
- `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is also not used in the provided code snippet).
- Depending on the value of `n`, `word` is constructed differently:
  - If `n` > 52, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
  - If `n` is between 27 and 52, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
  - If `n` is between 1 and 26, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

### Analysis:
To determine what `word` will be, we need to consider the range in which `n` falls:

1. **If `n` > 52:**
   - `word` is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
   - Since `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `alphabet[n - 53]` will be a character from this string based on the index `n - 53`.
   - For example, if `n = 53`, `word` would be `alphabet[0] + 'zz'` which is `'a' + 'zz'` resulting in `'azz'`.
   - If `n = 78`, `word` would be `alphabet[25] + 'zz'` which is `'z' + 'zz'` resulting in `'zzz'`.

2. **If 27 <= `n` <= 52:**
   - `word` is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - For example, if `n = 27`, `word` would be `'a' + alphabet[-1] + 'z'`. Since Python allows negative indexing, `alphabet[-1]` is `'z'`, so `word` would be `'azz'`.
   - If `n = 52`, `word` would be `'a' + alphabet[24] + 'z'` which is `'a' + 'y' + 'z'` resulting in `'ayz'`.

3. **If 1 <= `n` <= 26:**
   - `word` is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
   - For example, if `n = 1`, `word` would be `'aa' + alphabet[-2]` which is `'aa' + 'y'` resulting in `'aay'`.
   - If `n = 26`, `word` would be `'aa' + alphabet[23]` which is `'aa' + 'x'` resulting in `'aax'`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the value of `n`, `word` will be constructed differently according to the rules provided. We cannot determine the exact value of `n` without additional information, but we can describe how `word` will be constructed based on the range of `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **word (where word is constructed based on the value of n: alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz' if n > 52, 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z' if 27 <= n <= 52, 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3] if 1 <= n <= 26)**
