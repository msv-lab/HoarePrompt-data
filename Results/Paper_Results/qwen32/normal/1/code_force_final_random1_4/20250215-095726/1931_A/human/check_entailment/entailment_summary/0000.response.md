### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify whether it correctly computes the lexicographically smallest three-letter word for each given encoded integer `n`.

Let's break down the logic of the program and compare it with the requirements:

1. **Alphabet Mapping**: 
   - The program uses `string.ascii_lowercase` to map letters to their positions in the alphabet.
   - For example, 'a' maps to 0, 'b' maps to 1, ..., 'z' maps to 25.

2. **Logic for Constructing the Word**:
   - If `n > 52`, the program constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
     - This means the first character is determined by `n - 53`, and the last two characters are 'z'.
     - Since `n > 52`, `n - 53` will be a valid index in the alphabet (0 to 25).
   - If `26 < n <= 52`, the program constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
     - This means the first character is 'a', the second character is determined by `n - 28`, and the last character is 'z'.
     - Since `26 < n <= 52`, `n - 28` will be a valid index in the alphabet (0 to 24).
   - If `n <= 26`, the program constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
     - This means the first two characters are 'a', and the third character is determined by `n - 3`.
     - Since `n <= 26`, `n - 3` will be a valid index in the alphabet (0 to 23).

3. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The constructed words should be lexicographically smallest.
   - For `n > 52`, the word starts with the smallest possible letter that satisfies the condition, followed by 'zz'.
   - For `26 < n <= 52`, the word starts with 'a', followed by the smallest possible second letter, and ends with 'z'.
   - For `n <= 26`, the word starts with 'aa', followed by the smallest possible third letter.

Let's verify the examples given in the problem statement:

- For `n = 24`: The smallest word is `'aav'`.
  - According to the program, it falls under `n <= 26`, so it constructs `'aa' + alphabet[24 - 3]` which is `'aa' + 'v'` -> `'aav'`.
- For `n = 70`: The smallest word is `'rzz'`.
  - According to the program, it falls under `n > 52`, so it constructs `alphabet[70 - 53] + 'zz'` which is `'r' + 'zz'` -> `'rzz'`.
- For `n = 3`: The smallest word is `'aaa'`.
  - According to the program, it falls under `n <= 26`, so it constructs `'aa' + alphabet[3 - 3]` which is `'aa' + 'a'` -> `'aaa'`.
- For `n = 55`: The smallest word is `'czz'`.
  - According to the program, it falls under `n > 52`, so it constructs `alphabet[55 - 53] + 'zz'` which is `'c' + 'zz'` -> `'czz'`.
- For `n = 48`: The smallest word is `'auz'`.
  - According to the program, it falls under `26 < n <= 52`, so it constructs `'a' + alphabet[48 - 28] + 'z'` which is `'a' + 'u' + 'z'` -> `'auz'`.

All the examples match the expected output, indicating that the program is correctly constructing the lexicographically smallest word for each `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word for each given encoded integer `n`.

**Correctness: True**
