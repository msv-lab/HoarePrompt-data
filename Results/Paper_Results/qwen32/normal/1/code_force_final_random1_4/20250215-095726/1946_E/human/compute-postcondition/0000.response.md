The code snippet assigns the values returned by the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)` to the variables `c` and `d`. Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that `c` and `d` will take on whatever values are returned by `func_1` when called with the arguments `b` and `1000000007`.

The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers; `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`**.
