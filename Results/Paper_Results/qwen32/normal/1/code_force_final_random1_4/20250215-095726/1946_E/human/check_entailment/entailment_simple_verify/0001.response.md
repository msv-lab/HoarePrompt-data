### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program against the problem description and the annotated code to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the number of permutations of length `n` such that the given indices are prefix and suffix maximums.
- The result should be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:

1. **Functions Explanation:**
   - **func_1(a, b):** Computes the coefficients of the Bezout's identity, which helps in finding the modular multiplicative inverse.
     - If `b == 0`, it returns `(1, 0)`.
     - If `a < b`, it recursively calls itself with swapped arguments.
     - If `a % b == 0`, it returns `(1, -(a // b - 1))`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively computes the result using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - **func_2(a, b):** Uses `func_1` to compute \(a \times b^{-1} \mod 1000000007\), which is useful for computing combinations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program starts by precomputing factorials up to 200001 modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - For each test case:
     - It reads `n`, `m1`, `m2`, the list of prefix maximum indices `p`, and the list of suffix maximum indices `s`.
     - It checks if the last prefix maximum index matches the first suffix maximum index, the first prefix maximum index is 1, and the last suffix maximum index is `n`. If not, it prints `0`.
     - If the conditions are met, it calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods involving factorials and modular inverses.
     - It iterates through the suffix maximum indices and prefix maximum indices to compute the number of valid permutations.
     - Finally, it prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Annotations Validation:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after each function call.
   - They confirm that `func_1` computes the modular multiplicative inverse correctly, and `func_2` uses this to compute the required values modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program correctly handles the input parsing and validation.
   - It uses combinatorial mathematics (factorials and modular inverses) to compute the number of valid permutations.
   - The logic aligns with the problem requirements, and the annotations support the correctness of the implementation.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It handles the input, validates the conditions, and computes the number of valid permutations using appropriate mathematical techniques.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
