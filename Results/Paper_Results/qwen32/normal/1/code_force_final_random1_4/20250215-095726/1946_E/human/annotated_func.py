def func_1(a, b):

    #State: a and b are non-negative integers, b is greater than 0, and a is greater than or equal to b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple of two integers. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, the function returns either `(1, 0)` if `b` is zero, or computes a result based on the Euclidean algorithm, ultimately returning a tuple that represents the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity for `a` and `b`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_2(a, b):
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the result of (c * a) % 1000000007, where c and a are integers and c is the first value returned by func_1(b, 1000000007)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It computes the product of `a` and the first value `c` returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, then returns this product modulo 1000000007.
