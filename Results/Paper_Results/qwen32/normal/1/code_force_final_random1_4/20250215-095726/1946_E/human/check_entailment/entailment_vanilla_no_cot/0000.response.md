To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem described. The problem requires calculating the number of permutations of length \( n \) that match given prefix and suffix maximum indices, and then outputting the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

The provided code includes two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function seems to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and also the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.
2. `func_2(a, b)`: This function calculates the modular inverse of `b` modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) using `func_1`, and then multiplies it by `a` and takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

However, the provided code does not contain any logic to handle the problem of counting permutations with specific prefix and suffix maximums. It only provides utility functions for modular arithmetic, which might be useful for the actual solution but are not sufficient on their own.

To solve the problem, we would need to:
- Use combinatorial mathematics to count the number of valid permutations.
- Ensure that the constraints on prefix and suffix maximums are respected.
- Apply the results modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

Since the provided code does not include the necessary logic to address the problem requirements, it cannot be considered correct for the given problem.

Therefore, the response is:

Correctness: **False**
