Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple of two integers. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, the function returns either `(1, 0)` if `b` is zero, or computes a result based on the Euclidean algorithm, ultimately returning a tuple that represents the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity for `a` and `b`.**
