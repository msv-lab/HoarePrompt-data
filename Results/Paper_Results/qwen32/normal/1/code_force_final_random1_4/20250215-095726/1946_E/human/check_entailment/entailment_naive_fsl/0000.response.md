Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not address the problem description at all. The problem requires calculating the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximums. However, the given code consists of two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) that seem to be related to modular arithmetic and greatest common divisors (GCD), but they do not solve the problem of counting permutations with given prefix and suffix maximums.

To solve the problem, we would need to implement a solution that takes into account the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description. The current code does not handle any of the logic needed to count valid permutations, so it cannot be considered correct for the given problem.
