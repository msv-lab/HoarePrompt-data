### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided code systematically using the function summaries and the problem description.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective:** Count the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximums.
2. **Constraints:** The solution must be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
3. **Input:** Multiple test cases, each with:
   - `n`: Length of the permutation.
   - `m1`: Number of prefix maximums.
   - `m2`: Number of suffix maximums.
   - Indices of prefix maximums.
   - Indices of suffix maximums.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - Computes the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.
   - Used to find the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `a`.

2. **Function `func_2(a, b)`**:
   - Uses `func_1` to compute \(a \times b^{-1} \mod 1000000007\).
   - Essentially computes \(a / b \mod 1000000007\).

#### Function Summaries:
- **`func_2(a, b)`**: Computes \(a \times b^{-1} \mod 1000000007\).

#### Evaluation:
- **Relevance of Provided Functions**: The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are related to modular arithmetic and computing modular inverses. However, they do not directly address the problem of counting permutations with specific prefix and suffix maximums.
- **Missing Logic**: The code lacks the logic to:
  - Parse the input correctly.
  - Implement the combinatorial logic to count permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.
  - Handle multiple test cases efficiently.

#### Conclusion:
Given the problem requirements and the provided code, the code is incomplete and does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem. The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are useful for modular arithmetic but do not address the core problem of counting permutations.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
