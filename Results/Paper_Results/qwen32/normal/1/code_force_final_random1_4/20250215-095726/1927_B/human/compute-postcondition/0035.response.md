To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
```

This line of code appends a character from the `alp` list to the `ans` list. Here's what happens:

- `rev_array[j:]` slices the `rev_array` starting from index `j` to the end.
- `.count(rev_array[j])` counts the occurrences of the element at index `j` in the sliced array `rev_array[j:]`.
- `alp[... - 1]` uses the count minus one as an index to fetch a character from the `alp` list (which is a list of lowercase English letters).
- `ans.append(...)` adds this character to the `ans` list.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ans`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `l`, `array`, `alp`, `rev_array`) remain unchanged except for `ans`.

Let's denote the value of `rev_array[j]` as `val_j` and the count of `val_j` in `rev_array[j:]` as `count_val_j`. The character appended to `ans` will be `alp[count_val_j - 1]`.

Thus, the updated `ans` list will include the new character `alp[count_val_j - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `l` must be greater than or equal to 1, `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `rev_array` is the reversed list of `array`, `ans` is an empty list containing the character `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`**.
