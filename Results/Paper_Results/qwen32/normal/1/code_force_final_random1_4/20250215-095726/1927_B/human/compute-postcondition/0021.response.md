To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
```

This line of code performs the following actions:
- It counts the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist `rev_array[j:]`.
- It subtracts 1 from this count.
- It uses this result as an index to access an element in the list `alp`.
- It appends this element to the list `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is 1.
- `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `alp` is the list of lowercase English letters.
- `rev_array` is the reversed list of the new `array`.
- `ans` is an empty list.

After executing the code snippet, the only variable that changes is `ans`. The value appended to `ans` depends on the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` and the corresponding letter in `alp`.

Let's denote the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` as `count_j`. Then, the element appended to `ans` is `alp[count_j - 1]`.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `rev_array` is the reversed list of the new `array`, `ans` is a list containing one additional element `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`.**
