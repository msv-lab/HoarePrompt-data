To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for j in range(l):
```

This means that the only variable that can be adjusted is `j`.

### Analysis:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 2.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `l`.
- To proceed to the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

### Adjustment:
- Increment `j` by 1 to get the value for the next iteration.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` remains 1.
- `l` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `array` remains the list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `alp` remains the list of alphabets.
- `rev_array` remains the reversed list of the new `array`.
- `ans` remains a list containing two elements where the second element is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`.
- `j` is incremented to 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `rev_array` is the reversed list of the new `array`, `ans` is a list containing two elements where the second element is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`, `j` is 3**
