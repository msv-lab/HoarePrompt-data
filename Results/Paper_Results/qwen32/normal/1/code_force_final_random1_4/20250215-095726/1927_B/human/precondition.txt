t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the string, and a list a of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. It is guaranteed that for each test case, there exists a valid string s that corresponds to the given trace.
