To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the components step by step:

1. **Code Snippet**: `print(''.join(map(str, ans)))`
   - This line of code takes the `ans` variable, converts each element of `ans` to a string using `map(str, ans)`, and then joins these string representations together into a single string using `''.join(...)`.
   - Finally, it prints the resulting string.

2. **Initial State**: No specific initial state is provided about the `ans` variable. Therefore, we need to consider the general case where `ans` could be any iterable (like a list, tuple, set, etc.).

3. **Interpretation**:
   - If `ans` is a list of integers, for example `[1, 2, 3]`, then `map(str, ans)` would convert each integer to a string, resulting in `['1', '2', '3']`. Joining these strings with `''` would produce `'123'`.
   - If `ans` is a list of characters, for example `['a', 'b', 'c']`, then `map(str, ans)` would not change the elements since they are already strings, resulting in `['a', 'b', 'c']`. Joining these strings with `''` would produce `'abc'`.
   - If `ans` is a tuple of mixed types, for example `(1, 'b', 3)`, then `map(str, ans)` would convert each element to a string, resulting in `['1', 'b', '3']`. Joining these strings with `''` would produce `'1b3'`.

Given the lack of a specific `ans` value, the most precise description we can provide is that the output will be the concatenation of the string representations of the elements in `ans`.

Output: **the concatenation of the string representations of the elements in `ans`**
