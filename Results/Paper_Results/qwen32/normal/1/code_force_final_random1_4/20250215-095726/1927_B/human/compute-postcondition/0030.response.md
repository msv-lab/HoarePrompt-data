The code snippet `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `array`. This means that the value of `array` changes to whatever list of integers the user inputs.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `l`, `alp`, `rev_array`, and `ans`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `l` is the new integer input by the user, `array` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `rev_array` is the reversed list of the new `array`, `ans` is a list of length `l` containing characters from `alp` based on the count of elements in the remaining part of `rev_array`.**
