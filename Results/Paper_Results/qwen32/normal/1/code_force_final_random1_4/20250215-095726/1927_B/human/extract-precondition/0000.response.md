Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. It is guaranteed that for each test case, there exists a suitable string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z that corresponds to the given trace.**
