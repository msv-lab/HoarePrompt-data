Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is `input_string`.
- `h` is the first two characters of `s`. If `h` equals '00', then `h` remains '00'. Otherwise, `h` remains unchanged regardless of whether the integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12 or greater than 12.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

### Explanation:
1. **Extracting `h`**:
   - `h` is the first two characters of `s`.
   - If `h` is '00', it remains '00'.
   - Otherwise, `h` remains unchanged.

2. **Printing `s[2:]`**:
   - `s[2:]` means the substring of `s` starting from the third character to the end of the string.
   - This effectively removes the first two characters (`h`) from the string `s`.

3. **Determining AM/PM**:
   - The expression `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` is a conditional selection.
   - If `int(h) >= 12`, it selects 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, it selects 'AM'.

### Combining the Outputs:
- The first part of the output is `s[2:]`, which is the substring of `s` starting from the third character.
- The second part of the output is either 'AM' or 'PM', depending on whether the integer value of `h` is 12 or greater.

### Final Output:
Based on the above explanation, the output will be the substring of `s` starting from the third character, followed by either 'AM' or 'PM'.

Output: **substring of `s` starting from the third character, followed by 'AM' if the integer value of the first two characters of `s` is less than 12, otherwise 'PM'**.
