You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string s of length 5 with the format "hh:mm" where hh is a string representing the hour from "00" to "23" and mm is a string representing the minute from "00" to "59".

        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
        
    #State: All test cases have been processed and printed in the required format. The variable `t` is 0, `s` holds the last input string, and `h` holds the hour part of the last input string.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".

2. **Extracting Hours and Minutes:**
   - It extracts the hour part (`h`) from the string `s` using slicing (`s[:2]`).
   - The minutes part (`s[2:]`) remains unchanged.

3. **Converting Hours to 12-Hour Format:**
   - If `h` is `'00'`, it prints `'12'` because midnight in 24-hour format corresponds to 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is less than or equal to `'12'`, it prints the hour as it is, but this logic is flawed because it doesn't handle the leading zero correctly for single-digit hours (e.g., `'09'` should remain `'09'`).
   - If `h` is greater than `'12'`, it calculates the equivalent hour in the 12-hour format by subtracting 12 from the integer value of `h`. However, it incorrectly formats the result to have a leading zero if necessary (e.g., `'13'` should become `'01'`).

4. **Printing Minutes and Period (AM/PM):**
   - It prints the minutes part directly (`s[2:]`).
   - It determines whether to print "AM" or "PM" based on whether the hour is greater than or equal to 12.

### Issues Identified:
- The program does not correctly handle leading zeros for hours less than 10.
- The program incorrectly formats the hour when converting from 24-hour to 12-hour format, especially for hours between 13 and 23.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not entirely correct. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
