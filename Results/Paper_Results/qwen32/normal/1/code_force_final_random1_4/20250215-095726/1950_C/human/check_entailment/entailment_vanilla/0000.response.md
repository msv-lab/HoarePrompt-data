Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".

2. **Extracting Hours and Minutes:**
   - It extracts the hour part (`h`) from the string `s` using slicing (`s[:2]`).
   - The minutes part (`s[2:]`) remains unchanged.

3. **Converting Hours to 12-Hour Format:**
   - If `h` is `'00'`, it prints `'12'` because midnight in 24-hour format corresponds to 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is less than or equal to `'12'`, it prints the hour as it is, but this logic is flawed because it doesn't handle the leading zero correctly for single-digit hours (e.g., `'09'` should remain `'09'`).
   - If `h` is greater than `'12'`, it calculates the equivalent hour in the 12-hour format by subtracting 12 from the integer value of `h`. However, it incorrectly formats the result to have a leading zero if necessary (e.g., `'13'` should become `'01'`).

4. **Printing Minutes and Period (AM/PM):**
   - It prints the minutes part directly (`s[2:]`).
   - It determines whether to print "AM" or "PM" based on whether the hour is greater than or equal to 12.

### Issues Identified:
- The program does not correctly handle leading zeros for hours less than 10.
- The program incorrectly formats the hour when converting from 24-hour to 12-hour format, especially for hours between 13 and 23.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not entirely correct. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
