Let's break down the given Python code snippet and determine what will be printed based on the initial state provided:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is the input string.
- `h` is the first two characters of `s`.
  - If `h` equals '00', it remains '00'.
  - Otherwise, if the integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12, `h` remains unchanged.
  - If the integer value of `h` is greater than 12, `h` is greater than 12.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Extracting `s[2:]`:**
   - `s[2:]` means taking the substring of `s` starting from the third character (index 2) to the end of the string.
   - For example, if `s` is "13:45", then `s[2:]` would be "45".

2. **Determining the Time Convention (`['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]`):**
   - The expression `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` uses a list to select between 'AM' and 'PM'.
   - `int(h) >= 12` evaluates to `True` if `h` (the hour part of the time) is 12 or greater, and `False` otherwise.
   - If `int(h) >= 12` is `True`, the expression selects `'PM'` from the list.
   - If `int(h) >= 12` is `False`, the expression selects `'AM'` from the list.

### Example Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1:** `s = "09:30"`
  - `h = "09"` (which is less than 12)
  - `s[2:] = "30"`
  - `int(h) >= 12` is `False`, so `['AM', 'PM'][False]` selects `'AM'`.
  - Output: `"30 AM"`

- **Scenario 2:** `s = "13:45"`
  - `h = "13"` (which is greater than 12)
  - `s[2:] = "45"`
  - `int(h) >= 12` is `True`, so `['AM', 'PM'][True]` selects `'PM'`.
  - Output: `"45 PM"`

- **Scenario 3:** `s = "00:00"`
  - `h = "00"` (which is equal to 12)
  - `s[2:] = "00"`
  - `int(h) >= 12` is `True`, so `['AM', 'PM'][True]` selects `'PM'`.
  - Output: `"00 PM"`

### General Output Description:
The code prints the substring of `s` starting from the third character to the end, followed by either `'AM'` or `'PM'` based on whether the hour part of the time (`h`) is 12 or greater.

### Final Output:
Output: **s[2:] ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12] (where s[2:] is the substring of s from the third character to the end, and ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12] selects 'AM' if h is less than 12, and 'PM' if h is 12 or greater)**
