Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1439; `s` is the new input string; `h` is the first two characters of the new `s`. If `int(h)` is less than or equal to 12, then the conditions remain as stated. Otherwise, the conditions remain as stated.** 

Since the postconditions for both the if and else parts are identical, the overall postcondition simply restates these conditions without any additional changes.
