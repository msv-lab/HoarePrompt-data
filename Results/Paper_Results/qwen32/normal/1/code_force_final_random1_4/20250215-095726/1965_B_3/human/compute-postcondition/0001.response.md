The given code snippet writes the string representation of the return value of `func_14()` followed by a newline character to the standard output. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the function `func_14()`. Since there is no information about what `func_14()` returns, we cannot determine a specific value for it. We only know that `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, which is not directly relevant to the current code snippet.

Given the lack of specific details about `func_14()`, we can only infer that the output will be the string representation of whatever `func_14()` returns, followed by a newline character.

Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
Natural Language: The output state is that the string representation of the return value of `func_14()` followed by a newline character is written to the standard output. The precondition that `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0 remains unchanged.
