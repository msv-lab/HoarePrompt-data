The code appends \(2^i\) to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 4, \(2^i\) is \(2^4\), which equals 16. Therefore, the list `ans` will now contain `[2, 8, 16]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 < k \leq n\); `b` is the binary string representation of `n`; `l` is the length of `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k`; `ans` is a list containing `[2, 8, 16]`; `i` is 4; `lk` is greater than 5**.
