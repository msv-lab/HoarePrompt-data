To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the functions involved.

The loop is structured as follows:
```python
for _ in range(func_10()):
    sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
```

- `func_10()` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.
- `func_14()` is called in each iteration, and its return value is converted to a string and printed to the standard output followed by a newline character.

From the provided information:
- After the first iteration, `func_14()` returns a value and prints it.
- After the second iteration, `func_14()` again returns a value and prints it.
- After the third iteration, `func_14()` once more returns a value and prints it.

This pattern suggests that `func_14()` is called exactly `num_iterations` times, where `num_iterations` is the value returned by `func_10()`. Each call to `func_14()` results in a new line of output.

Since the loop executes exactly `num_iterations` times and each iteration results in one line of output, the final output state will consist of `num_iterations` lines, each containing the result of `func_14()` for that iteration.

Given that the problem does not specify the exact number of iterations or the specific outputs of `func_14()`, we can generalize the final output state as follows:

**Output State:** The output consists of `num_iterations` lines, where each line contains the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` during that iteration.

If we assume `num_iterations` is 3 based on the given examples, the output would look like this:
```
result1
result2
result3
```

However, without knowing the exact number of iterations and the specific results from `func_14()`, we can only describe the output state in a generalized form.

Therefore, the final output state in the required format is:

Output State: **The output consists of `num_iterations` lines, where each line contains the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` during that iteration.**
