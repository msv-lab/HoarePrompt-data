You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters in its signature. It relies on other functions (`func_10` and `func_14`) which are not defined in the provided code snippet. However, based on the usage, `func_10()` likely returns the number of test cases (t), and `func_14()` likely processes each test case to determine the required sequence and its size.
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
        
    #State: The output consists of `num_iterations` lines, where each line contains the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` during that iteration.
    #
    #If we assume `num_iterations` is 3 based on the given examples, the output would look like this:
    #```
    #result1
    #result2
    #result3
    #```
    #
    #However, without knowing the exact number of iterations and the specific results from `func_14()`, we can only describe the output state in a generalized form.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state in the required format is:
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It uses other functions (`func_10` and `func_14`) to determine the number of test cases and process each test case respectively. It then returns the required sequence and its size for each test case.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
