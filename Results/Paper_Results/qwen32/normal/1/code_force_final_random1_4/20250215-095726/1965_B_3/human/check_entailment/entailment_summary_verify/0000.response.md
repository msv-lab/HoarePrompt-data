To verify the correctness of the program, let's carefully analyze the logic and behavior of `func_14` in the context of the problem description. We'll focus on both the special case where `k == 1` and the general case where `k > 1`.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_14`

#### Special Case: `k == 1`
1. **When `n == 2`**:
   - The sequence returned is `[2]`.
   - The only possible sum is `2`, which is not `1`. This satisfies the condition that there is no subsequence with a sum of `k`.
   - All sums from `1` to `n` except `k` (i.e., `2`) can be formed trivially since `n == 2` and `k == 1`.

2. **When `n > 2`**:
   - The sequence returned is `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - The sequence `[2, 3]` allows forming sums `2` and `3`.
   - Powers of 2 allow forming any sum that is a combination of these powers.
   - Since `1` cannot be formed by any combination of `2`, `3`, and powers of 2, the condition is satisfied.

#### General Case: `k > 1`
1. **Initialization**:
   - The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`. This ensures that all sums up to `k-1` can be formed.
   - Example: If `k = 5` (binary `101`), the initial sequence would be `[1, 2]` (powers of 2 up to `2^2`).

2. **Avoiding Sum `k`**:
   - The term `k - 1 - sum(ans)` is added to the sequence. This term ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - Example: If `k = 5` and the initial sequence is `[1, 2]`, then `sum(ans) = 3` and `k - 1 - sum(ans) = 5 - 1 - 3 = 1`. Adding `1` to the sequence would allow forming `1`, but since `1` is already in the sequence, this term is adjusted to avoid forming `k`.

3. **Forming Sums Greater than `k`**:
   - The terms `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` are added to the sequence. These terms help in forming sums greater than `k`.
   - Additional powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n` are added to ensure all sums up to `n` can be formed.

4. **Verification**:
   - The sequence must ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - All sums from `1` to `n` except `k` must be formable.

### Testing Edge Cases
- **Small Values**: Test with small values of `n` and `k` to ensure correctness.
  - Example: `n = 6`, `k = 1` should return a sequence like `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
  - Example: `n = 8`, `k = 8` should return a sequence like `[1, 2, 4, 7]`.

- **Large Values**: Test with large values of `n` and `k` to ensure the sequence does not exceed size 25 and meets the criteria.
  - Example: `n = 10^6`, `k = 10^6 - 1` should return a sequence that avoids summing to `10^6 - 1` while allowing all other sums.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the logic and behavior of `func_14`, it appears that the program correctly constructs the sequence `a` for each test case, ensuring that all sums from `1` to `n` except `k` can be formed, and no subsequence sums to `k`.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
