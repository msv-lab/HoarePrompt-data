In this task, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the function call `func_10()`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in Python for iteration when the loop variable is not needed. The loop will continue as long as the value returned by `func_10()` is greater than the current iteration count.

Given:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `num_iterations` remains the same; `func_14()` returns a value `result` which is written to the standard output followed by a newline character.

We need to adjust the state based on the loop head. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, it doesn't need to be explicitly tracked or adjusted. The key factor here is the return value of `func_10()`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:
1. The loop will execute as long as the number of iterations (which can be inferred from `func_10()`) is greater than the current iteration count.
2. Since `num_iterations` remains the same, it implies that the number of iterations the loop is supposed to run does not change between iterations.
3. The loop variable `_` is incremented implicitly by the `range()` function.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the return value of `func_10()` must be greater than the current iteration count. Since we don't have explicit information about the current iteration count, we can infer that it has just completed an iteration, so the next iteration would increment the implicit counter by 1.

State: **`num_iterations` remains the same; `func_14()` returns a value `result` which is written to the standard output followed by a newline character. The loop will execute again if `func_10()` returns a value greater than the current iteration count.** 

Since we don't have the exact current iteration count, we can't specify it, but we know the loop will proceed if `func_10()` returns a value that allows another iteration. Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`num_iterations` remains the same; `func_14()` returns a value `result` which is written to the standard output followed by a newline character.**
