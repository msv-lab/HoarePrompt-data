To determine the output of the `print(b)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
- `s` is the input string.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`.
- The number of unique characters in `a` is not equal to 2.
- `b` is the string `s` sorted alphabetically.
- `c` is the string `s` sorted in reverse alphabetical order.
- `b` is not equal to `s`.

From this information, we know that `b` is the result of sorting the string `s` in alphabetical order. Since `b` is not equal to `s`, it means that the original string `s` was not already sorted in alphabetical order.

Given these conditions, the output of `print(b)` will be the alphabetically sorted version of the string `s`.

Since the specific string `s` is not provided, we cannot give an exact sequence of characters. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **b (where b is the string s sorted alphabetically)**
