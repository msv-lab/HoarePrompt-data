Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, the number of unique characters in `a` is not equal to 2, `b` is the string `s` sorted alphabetically, and `c` is the string `s` sorted in reverse alphabetical order. If `b` is equal to `s`, then `s` is already sorted alphabetically. Otherwise, `s` is not sorted alphabetically.**
