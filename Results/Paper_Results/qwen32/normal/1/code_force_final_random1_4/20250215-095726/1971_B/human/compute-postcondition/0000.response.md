The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. This means `n` will take the integer value of whatever is input next. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10 for each of the `t` test cases. Since the code does not affect `t` or `s`, these remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters; `n` is an input integer.**
