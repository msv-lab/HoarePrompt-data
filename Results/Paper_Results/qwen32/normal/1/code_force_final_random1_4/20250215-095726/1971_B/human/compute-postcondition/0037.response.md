Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new input string `s`, `b` is the original `s` sorted alphabetically, `c` is the original `s` sorted in reverse alphabetical order. If `b` is equal to the original `s`, then the original `s` is already sorted alphabetically; otherwise, the original `s` is not sorted alphabetically. `i` is `i + 1`. Additionally, if the length of `a` is 2, the specific behavior of the if part is implied, but it does not change the described properties of the variables.**
