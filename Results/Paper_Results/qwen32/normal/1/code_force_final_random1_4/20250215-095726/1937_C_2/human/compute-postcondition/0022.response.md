To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variable `t`:** It is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. However, it is not used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output.
2. **Variable `n`:** It must be greater than 1. Again, this variable is not used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output.
3. **Variable `k`:** It is defined as the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or `1` if no such response was received. Since the exact responses are not provided, we can only describe `k` based on this definition.
4. **Variable `best`:** It is explicitly set to `0`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown of what will be printed:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `k` is described as the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or `1` if no such response was received.
- `best` is explicitly `0`.
- `k` is repeated from the previous point.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, since `i` is mentioned in the context of determining `k`, we can infer that `i` is likely an index used in the process of determining `k`. Given that `k` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, `i` could be any index from 2 to n-1, but we don't have enough information to pinpoint its exact value.

Given the information, the output will be:
Output: **? [k] 0 [k] [i] (where [k] is the largest index i (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was '<', or 1 if no such response was received, and [i] is an index used in the process of determining k)**
