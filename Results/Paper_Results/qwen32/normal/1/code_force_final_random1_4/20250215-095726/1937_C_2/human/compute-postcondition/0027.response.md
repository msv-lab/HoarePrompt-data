To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³;
- `n` is greater than 1;
- If `res` equals `'<'`, then `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or `1` if no such response was received, and `best` is set to `i`.
- If `res` does not equal `'<'`, `k` and `best` retain their original values.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we know that `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State at End of Previous Iteration:**
   - Let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. This means the loop just completed its execution for `i = x`.
   
2. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the loop range.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration, we increment `i` by 1.
- `n` remains the same as it is the loop boundary.

### Final State at Start of Next Iteration:
- `i` is now `x + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `k` and `best` retain their original values if `res` does not equal `'<'`; if `res` equals `'<'`, `k` is updated to the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or `1` if no such response was received, and `best` is set to `i`.** 

However, focusing strictly on the variables in the loop head (`i` and `n`):

State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is greater than 1**.
