Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. This value does not affect the print statement directly.
- `n` is greater than 2. This value also does not affect the print statement directly.
- `k` is set to `n` if `res` equals `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1. Since `res` is described as the value of the user's new input, we don't know its value yet. However, since it's not specified that `res` equals `<`, we assume `k` remains 1.
- `best` is set to 1. This value does not affect the print statement directly.
- `res` is the value of the user's new input. This value does not affect the print statement directly.
- `i` is set to 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Given that `k` remains 1 (since `res` is not specified to be `<`) and `i` is 2, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` as a literal string,
- `0` as an integer,
- `k` which is `1`,
- `0` as an integer,
- `i` which is `2`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 1 0 2**
