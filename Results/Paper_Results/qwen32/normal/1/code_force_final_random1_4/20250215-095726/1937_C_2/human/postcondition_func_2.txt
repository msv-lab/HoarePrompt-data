The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` from the input, where `2 <= n <= 10^4`. It then determines two indices, `max_index` and `min_index`, based on the results of calls to `func_1` with different arguments. Finally, it calls `func_2` with `max_index` and `min_index` as arguments. The function does not return any value and always returns `None`.
