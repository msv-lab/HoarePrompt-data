The code snippet reads a new value for `res` from the input. This changes the value of `res` but does not affect the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`) directly unless the new value of `res` triggers a condition that modifies them. Since the new value of `res` is read but no further operations are performed that depend on this new value in the given snippet, `k` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is greater than 2; `res` is the new input string; If `res` is `<`, then `k` is set to the value of `i`. Otherwise, `k` remains 1; `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.
