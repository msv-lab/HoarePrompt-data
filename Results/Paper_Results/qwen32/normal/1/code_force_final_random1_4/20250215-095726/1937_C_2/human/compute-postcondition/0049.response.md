To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. This variable represents the number of test cases but is not directly used in the print statement.
2. **`n`**: Greater than 2. This variable represents the size of some sequence or array.
3. **`k`**: This variable is set to `i` if `res` equals `'<'`; otherwise, it remains 1. Initially, `k` is 1 unless specified otherwise.
4. **`best`**: The largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was received. This variable is not directly used in the print statement.
5. **`res`**: The value of the input received. This variable influences the value of `k`.
6. **`i`**: Incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the last iteration. Initially, `i` starts at 1 and increments with each iteration.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

#### Values to be Printed:
- **`'?'`**: A literal string.
- **`0`**: A literal integer.
- **`k`**: This value depends on the value of `res` from previous iterations. If `res` was `'<'`, `k` would be set to the current `i`. Otherwise, `k` remains 1.
- **`0`**: Another literal integer.
- **`i`**: The current value of `i`, which is incremented by 1 in each iteration starting from 1.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the exact values of `k` and `i` depend on the previous iterations and the responses (`res`). However, since the problem does not specify the exact state of `k` and `i` before this print statement, we can only describe them in terms of their definitions.

- **`k`**: Either 1 (if no previous `res` was `'<'`) or the largest `i` for which `res` was `'<'`.
- **`i`**: The current iteration index, starting from 1 and incremented by 1 in each iteration.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 k 0 i (where k is either 1 or the largest i for which res was '<', and i is the current iteration index)**
