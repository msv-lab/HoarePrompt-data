Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers `a` and `b`, and integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. For each test case, it counts how many contiguous subarrays of length `m` in `a` contain at least `k` elements also present in `b`. It then prints the count for each test case.**
