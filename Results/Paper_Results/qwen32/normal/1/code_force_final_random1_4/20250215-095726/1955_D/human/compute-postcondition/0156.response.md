Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers, `n` is greater than `m`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative, `curr` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cnt_b` or `curr`. `ans` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
