The code snippet provided decrements the value of `curr` by 1. No other variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers, `n` is greater than `m`, `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` was the value at the end of the last iteration), `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `curr` is decreased by 1.**
