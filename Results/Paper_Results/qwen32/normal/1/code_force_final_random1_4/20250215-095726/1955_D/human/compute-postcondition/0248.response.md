Output State: **`i` is the last element in `b_values`, `cnt_b` has all its elements set to 0 for keys that were in `b_values`, `b_values` remains unchanged, `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k`, and `curr` is the final count of elements in `a` that were found in `b_values` and had a non-negative count in `cnt_b`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, each element in `b_values` will have its corresponding value in `cnt_b` set to 0. The variable `i` will hold the last element from `b_values`. The list `b_values` itself remains unchanged. The variable `ans` keeps track of how many times the condition `curr >= k` was met during the loop's execution. Lastly, `curr` represents the final count of elements in `a` that were also in `b_values` and had a non-negative count in `cnt_b` before being reset to 0 in the loop.
