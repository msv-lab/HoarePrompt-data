You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

    max_val = 1000000
    cnt_b = [0] * (max_val + 1)
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())

            if a[i] in b_values:

        for i in range(n - m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
                    curr -= 1
            if a[i + m] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
            if curr >= k:
                ans += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
        for i in b_values:
            cnt_b[i] = 0
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` iterations of the loop have been executed. For each iteration, `cnt_b` is reset to 0 for all elements in `b_values`. The variable `ans` holds the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` across all iterations. The variable `curr` reflects the final count of elements in `a` that were found in `b_values` and had a non-negative count in `cnt_b` for the last processed window of size `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b`. The integer `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5. The list `a` contains `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and the list `b` contains `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
