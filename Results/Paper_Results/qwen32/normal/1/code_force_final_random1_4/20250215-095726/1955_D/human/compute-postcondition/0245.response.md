Output State: **`i` is the next element in `b_values`, `cnt_b` reflects the final net changes due to the decrements except `cnt_b[i]` which is now 0, `b_values` is a list that must have at least one element, `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k`, and `curr` is the final count of elements in `a` that were found in `b_values` and had a non-negative count in `cnt_b`.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt_b[i]` has been set to 0, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
