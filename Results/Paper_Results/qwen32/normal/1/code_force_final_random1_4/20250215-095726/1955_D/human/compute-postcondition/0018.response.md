The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n`, `k` are integers read from the input
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input
- `b` is a list of integers read from the input
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1
- `cnt_b` contains the counts of the first `m` elements of `b`
- `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`
- `ans` is 0
- `curr` is 0
- `a[i]` is in `b_values`

After executing the line `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1`, the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `cnt_b` contains the counts of the first `m` elements of `b` with the count of `a[i]` decreased by 1; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is 0; `a[i]` is in `b_values`.**
