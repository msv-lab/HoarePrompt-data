To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses from the given initial state and the described outputs after the first three iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs from `i = m` to `i = n - m - 1`.
- For each iteration `i`, it checks if `a[i]` and `a[i + m]` are in `b_values` and updates `cnt_b` accordingly.
- It adjusts `curr` based on the counts in `cnt_b`.
- If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.

### Key Points from the Iterations:
1. **After 1st Iteration (i = m):**
   - `cnt_b[a[m + m]]` is decremented if `a[m + m]` is in `b_values`.
   - `curr` is adjusted based on the new `cnt_b[a[m + m]]`.
   - `ans` is incremented if `curr >= k`.

2. **After 2nd Iteration (i = m + 1):**
   - `cnt_b[a[m + 1]]` is incremented if `a[m + 1]` is in `b_values`.
   - `curr` is adjusted based on the new `cnt_b[a[m + 1]]`.
   - `cnt_b[a[m + 1 + m]]` is decremented if `a[m + 1 + m]` is in `b_values`.
   - `curr` is adjusted based on the new `cnt_b[a[m + 1 + m]]`.
   - `ans` is incremented if `curr >= k`.

3. **After 3rd Iteration (i = m + 2):**
   - `cnt_b[a[m + 2]]` is incremented if `a[m + 2]` is in `b_values`.
   - `curr` is adjusted based on the new `cnt_b[a[m + 2]]`.
   - `cnt_b[a[m + 2 + m]]` is decremented if `a[m + 2 + m]` is in `b_values`.
   - `curr` is adjusted based on the new `cnt_b[a[m + 2 + m]]`.
   - `ans` is incremented if `curr >= k`.

### Final State After All Iterations:
- The loop runs for `n - m` iterations.
- Each iteration adjusts `cnt_b` and `curr` based on the elements in `a` and their presence in `b_values`.
- `ans` is incremented whenever `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Conclusion:
- The final state will reflect the cumulative effect of all iterations.
- `i` will be `n - m` after the loop completes.
- `cnt_b` will have the final counts of elements from `a` that are in `b_values`.
- `curr` will reflect the final count of elements in `a` that were found in `b_values` with non-negative counts in `cnt_b`.
- `ans` will be the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.

Output State: **`i` is `n - m`, `cnt_b` reflects the final net changes due to the decrements, `b_values` is unchanged, `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k`, and `curr` is the final count of elements in `a` that were found in `b_values` and had a non-negative count in `cnt_b`.**
