The code snippet sets `cnt_b[i]` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `curr`, `ans`, `b_values`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `cnt_b[i]` is now 0.

Output State: **`i` is the next element in `b_values`, `curr` reflects the net effect of the increments and decrements based on the elements in `a` and their presence in `b_values`, `ans` reflects how many times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution, `b_values` must contain at least one element, `cnt_b[i]` is 0**.
