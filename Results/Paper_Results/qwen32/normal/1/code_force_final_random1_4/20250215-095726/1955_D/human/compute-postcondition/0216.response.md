The given code snippet only increments the variable `ans` by 1. None of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `curr`, `k`, `m`) are modified in the provided code.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for `ans`, which is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `n` is greater than `m`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, and if the new value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `curr` remain unchanged. Additionally, `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. `ans` is incremented by 1.**
