Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`; `cnt_b` contains the counts of the first `m` elements of `b` after all iterations; `curr` is 0; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
            curr += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`; `cnt_b` contains the counts of the first `m` elements of `b` after all iterations except the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`; `a[i]` may or may not be in `b_values`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and its count in `cnt_b` is non-negative, then `curr` is 1; otherwise, `curr` remains 0. `ans` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`; `cnt_b` contains the counts of the first `m` elements of `b` after all iterations except the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`; `a[i]` may or may not be in `b_values`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and its count in `cnt_b` is non-negative, then `curr` is 1; otherwise, `curr` remains 0. `ans` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative, `curr` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`, `cnt_b` contains the counts of the first `m` elements of `b` after all iterations except the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and its count in `cnt_b` is non-negative, then `curr` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged. The count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1 if `a[i]` is in `cnt_b`. `ans` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
