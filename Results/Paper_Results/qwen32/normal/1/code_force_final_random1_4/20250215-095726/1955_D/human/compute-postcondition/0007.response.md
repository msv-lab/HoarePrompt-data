The given line of code `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `b[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. 

Based on the initial state, `b` is a list of integers, and `cnt_b` is assumed to be a dictionary that keeps track of the counts of elements from the list `b`. After executing the line of code, the count of the element `b[i]` in `cnt_b` will increase by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1.**
