The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This operation does not affect the variables `i`, `cnt_b`, `curr`, or `ans` directly. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the last element of `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`, `curr` reflects the net effect of the increments and decrements based on the elements in `a` and their presence in `b_values`, and `ans` reflects how many times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers read from the input.**
