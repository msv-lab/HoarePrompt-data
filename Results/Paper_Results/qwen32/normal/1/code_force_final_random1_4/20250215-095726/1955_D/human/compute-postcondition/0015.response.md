The code snippet provided initializes a variable `curr` to 0. No other variables are modified or used in the given code. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the variable `curr` with the value 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `cnt_b` contains the counts of the first `m` elements of `b`; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is 0.**
