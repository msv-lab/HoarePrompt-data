The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. 

Given that `a[i]` is in `b_values`, which means `a[i]` is one of the keys in `cnt_b`, the count associated with `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is reduced by 1.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `b_values`, `curr`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`; `cnt_b` contains the counts of the first `m` elements of `b` after all iterations except the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1; `curr` is 0; `ans` is 0; `a[i]` is in `b_values`.**
