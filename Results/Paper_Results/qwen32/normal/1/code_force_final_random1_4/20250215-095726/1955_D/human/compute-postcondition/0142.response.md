The given code snippet only contains one line: `curr += 1`. This line increments the value of the variable `curr` by 1.

Given the initial state, the only variable affected by this line is `curr`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers, `n` is greater than `m`, `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` was the value at the end of the last iteration). If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` becomes greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. `curr` is incremented by 1.**
