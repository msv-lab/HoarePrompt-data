The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each of these elements to an integer, and stores them in a list named `b`. This operation does not affect the existing variables `i`, `cnt_b`, `curr`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is the last element of `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`, `curr` reflects the net effect of the increments and decrements based on the elements in `a` and their presence in `b_values`, and `ans` reflects how many times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**
