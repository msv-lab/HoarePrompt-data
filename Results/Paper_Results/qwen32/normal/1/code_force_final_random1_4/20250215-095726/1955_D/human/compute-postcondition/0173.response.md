The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `m` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `m` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

The state `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented within the loop body, but since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, we do not change this state.

State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1**
