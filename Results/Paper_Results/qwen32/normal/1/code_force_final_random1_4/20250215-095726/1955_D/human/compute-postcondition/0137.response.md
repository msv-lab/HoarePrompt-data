The given code snippet increments the count of the element at index `i` of array `a` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers, `n` is greater than `m`, `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` was the value at the end of the last iteration), `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` has been increased by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `i`) retain their previous values, with `i` being incremented by 1 from its previous value.
