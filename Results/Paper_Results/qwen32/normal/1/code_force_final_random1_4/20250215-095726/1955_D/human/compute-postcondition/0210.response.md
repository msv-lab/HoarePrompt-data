The given code snippet decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `m`
- `n` is greater than `m`
- `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`
- If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[m]]` is incremented by 1, and if the new value of `cnt_b[a[m]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1.

After executing `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1`, the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` will decrease by 1. No other variables are explicitly modified by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `n` is greater than `m`, `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1.**
