The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. This means the value associated with the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` is increased by 1.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is the value in the dictionary `cnt_b` corresponding to the key `a[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers, `n` is greater than `m`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**
