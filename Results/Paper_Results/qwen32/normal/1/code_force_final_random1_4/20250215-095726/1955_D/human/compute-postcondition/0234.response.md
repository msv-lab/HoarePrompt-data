The code snippet provided decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is `m + 2`, so `i + m` simplifies to `2m + 2`.

Here's the impact of the code on the program:
- The value of `cnt_b[a[2m + 2]]` is decreased by 1.

No other variables are mentioned as being affected by this operation directly, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `m + 2`, `n` is greater than `m + 2`. If `a[m + 2]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[m + 2]]` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[m + 2]]` becomes greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. Additionally, `cnt_b[a[2m + 2]]` is decreased by 1.**
