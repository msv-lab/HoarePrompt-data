Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is at least `m + 1`; `k` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` was greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1. `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. `curr` is the number of elements in `a` (up to the first `m` elements) that were also in `b` and had a positive count in `cnt_b` after the loop. `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, no changes are made to `cnt_b`, `curr`, or `ans`. `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1.**
