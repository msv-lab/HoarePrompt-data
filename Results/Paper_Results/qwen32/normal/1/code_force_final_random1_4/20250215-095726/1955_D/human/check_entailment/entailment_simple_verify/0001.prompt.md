You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: After all iterations, `t` iterations of the loop have been executed. For each iteration, `cnt_b` is reset to 0 for all elements in `b_values`. The variable `ans` holds the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` across all iterations. The variable `curr` reflects the final count of elements in `a` that were found in `b_values` and had a non-negative count in `cnt_b` for the last processed window of size `m`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program step-by-step to ensure it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `cnt_b` as a list of zeros with a size of `max_val + 1`, where `max_val` is set to `1000000`. This is because the maximum value any element in `a` or `b` can have is `10^6`.
   
2. **Reading Input**:
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the array `a` of length `n` and the array `b` of length `m`.

3. **Counting Elements in `b`**:
   - It increments the count of each element in `b` in the `cnt_b` list.

4. **Checking First Subsegment**:
   - It checks the first subsegment of `a` of length `m` to see if it can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of `b`.
   - For each element in the first subsegment, if it exists in `b` (checked using `b_values`), it decrements its count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count remains non-negative.
   - If `curr` (number of matched elements) is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.

5. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - It uses a sliding window approach to check subsequent subsegments of `a`:
     - For each new subsegment starting from index `i + 1` to `i + m`, it adjusts the counts:
       - If the element leaving the window (`a[i]`) was part of the matches, it increments its count in `cnt_b` and decrements `curr` if the count becomes positive.
       - If the element entering the window (`a[i + m]`) is part of the matches, it decrements its count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count remains non-negative.
     - If `curr` is still greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.

6. **Output**:
   - After processing all subsegments for the current test case, it prints `ans`.

7. **Resetting Counts**:
   - Before moving to the next test case, it resets the counts of elements in `b` in `cnt_b` to zero.

### Correctness:

- The program efficiently counts the number of good subsegments using a sliding window technique, which ensures that each element is processed only a constant number of times across all test cases.
- The use of `cnt_b` to keep track of the counts of elements in `b` within the current window allows for quick adjustments when the window slides.
- The program correctly handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
