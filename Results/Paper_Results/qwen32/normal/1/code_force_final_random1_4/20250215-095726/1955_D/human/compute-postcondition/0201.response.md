Postcondition: **`i` is `m`, `cnt_b` reflects the net changes due to the decrements, `b_values` is unchanged, `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, and `curr` is the count of elements in `a` that were found in `b_values` and had a non-negative count in `cnt_b`.**
