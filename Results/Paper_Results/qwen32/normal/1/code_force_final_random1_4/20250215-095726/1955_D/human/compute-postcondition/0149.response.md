The code snippet `curr -= 1` decrements the value of `curr` by 1. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `cnt_b[a[i]]`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers, `n` is greater than `m`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `curr` is decreased by 1.**
