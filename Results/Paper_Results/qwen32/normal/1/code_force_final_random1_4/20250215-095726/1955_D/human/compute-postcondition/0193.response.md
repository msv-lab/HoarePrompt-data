The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `m` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2**
