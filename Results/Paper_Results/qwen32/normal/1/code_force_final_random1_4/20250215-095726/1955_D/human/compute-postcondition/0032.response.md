Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `cnt_b` contains the counts of the first `m` elements of `b` with the count of `a[m]` decreased by 1 if `a[m]` is in `b_values`; `b_values` is a set of unique elements from the list `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is either 1 or 2; `i` is `m`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `curr` is set to 2 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `curr` remains 1.**
