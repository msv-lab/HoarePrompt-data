Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` is 1.
- `k` is an integer.
- `L` is `[1]`.
- `pow` is 2.
- `tot` is `tot + a` (However, there is no definition of `a` in the initial state, so we assume `tot` was initialized to some value and then incremented by `a`. Since `a` is not specified, let's assume `tot` is initialized to 0 for simplicity, making `tot = 0 + a = a`).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `pow` is 2.
   - `k` is an integer (value not specified, but it exists).
   - `tot` is `a` (value of `a` not specified, but it exists).

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - Substituting `pow` with 2, the expression becomes `2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.

3. **Simplification:**
   - Let's denote `k - tot` as `x` for simplicity.
   - The expression now becomes `2 * (2 * x - 1)`.
   - Expanding this, we get `2 * (2 * x - 1) = 4 * x - 2`.

4. **Final Expression:**
   - Substituting back `x` with `k - tot`, we get `4 * (k - tot) - 2`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be `4 * (k - tot) - 2`. Since `k` and `tot` (which is `a`) are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot compute a specific numerical value. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **4 * (k - tot) - 2 (where k is an integer and tot is the value of a)**
