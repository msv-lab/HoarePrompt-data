To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is 4
- `n` is 0
- `k` is an input integer (its specific value is not given)
- `L` is [3, 1, 1]
- `pow` is 2
- `m` is 1
- `tot` is `tot + 3` (if applicable), but since there's no indication of any previous value or operation affecting `tot`, we assume `tot` is initially 0 (as it's not explicitly set).
- `a` is 1

### Expression Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

Let's substitute the known values into the expression:
- `pow` is 2
- `tot` is 0 (assuming it hasn't been modified from its initial state)

So the expression becomes:
```python
print(2 * (2 * (k - 0) - 1))
```
Which simplifies to:
```python
print(2 * (2 * k - 1))
```

### Final Expression:
The final expression inside the `print` function is `2 * (2 * k - 1)`. Since the value of `k` is not specified, we cannot compute a numerical value. However, we can express the output in terms of `k`.

### Output Description:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `2 * (2 * k - 1)`, where `k` is the input integer.

Output: **2 * (2 * k - 1) (where k is the input integer)**
