Given the initial state, we need to evaluate the effect of the line `L.append(m)`.

Initial State: 
- `t` is 3
- `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`
- `k` is the second integer from the input
- `L` is []
- `tot` is 5
- `pow` is 8
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`

Let's determine the value of `n` first:
- `n` is defined as `n - (n + 1) // 2`. Let's assume `n` initially has some value `x`. Then `n` becomes `x - (x + 1) // 2`.
- For simplicity, let's consider `x` to be any integer. If `x` is even, say `x = 2`, then `n` becomes `2 - (2 + 1) // 2 = 2 - 1 = 1`.
- If `x` is odd, say `x = 3`, then `n` becomes `3 - (3 + 1) // 2 = 3 - 2 = 1`.
- Thus, regardless of whether `x` is even or odd, `n` simplifies to `x - (x + 1) // 2`, which results in `n` being `floor(x / 2)`.

Next, let's determine the value of `m`:
- `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`.
- Since `n` simplifies to `floor(x / 2)`, `m` becomes `(floor(x / 2) + 1) // 2`.

For the sake of simplicity, let's assume `x` is such that `n` evaluates to a specific value. Given the initial state does not specify a concrete value for `n`, we'll proceed with the understanding that `m` is derived from `n` as described.

Now, the list `L` is initially empty `[]`. After executing `L.append(m)`, `L` will contain the single element `m`.

Thus, the updated state is:
- `t` remains 3
- `n` remains `n - (n + 1) // 2`
- `k` remains the second integer from the input
- `L` is now `[m]`
- `tot` remains 5
- `pow` remains 8
- `m` remains `(n + 1) // 2`

Output State: **`t` is 3; `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`; `k` is the second integer from the input; `L` is `[(n + 1) // 2]`; `tot` is 5; `pow` is 8; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
