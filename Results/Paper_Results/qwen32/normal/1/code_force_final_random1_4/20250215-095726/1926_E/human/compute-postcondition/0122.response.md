To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case based on the provided conditions and logic. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then performs different calculations based on whether `k > (n + 1) // 2`.

Let's break down the final state after all iterations:

1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes several variables (`s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, `y`) based on the value of `k` relative to `(n + 1) // 2`.

2. **Logic Based on `k`**:
   - If `k <= (n + 1) // 2`, it directly prints `2 * k - 1`.
   - If `k > (n + 1) // 2`, it calculates `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, and `y` through iterative halving and prints `y`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After processing all `t` test cases, the variables `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, and `y` will reflect the state of the last test case processed.
   - The variable `t` will be 0 since all iterations are completed.
   - The variables `n` and `k` will hold the values of the last test case processed.

### Output State Description:
- **`t`**: Will be 0 as all iterations are completed.
- **`n` and `k`**: Will hold the values of the last test case processed.
- **`s`**: Will be the cumulative sum of `(d + 1) // 2` for each iteration until `d` becomes 0 if the last test case had `k > (n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `s` is 0.
- **`i`**: Will be the number of iterations until `d` becomes 0 if the last test case had `k > (n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `i` is 0.
- **`d`**: Will be 0 if the last test case had `k > (n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `d` is equal to `n`.
- **`h`**: Will be 0 if the last test case had `k > (n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `h` is equal to `n`.
- **`p`**: Will be `i` if the last test case had `k > (n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `p` is 1.
- **`g`**: Will be the sum of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration until `h` becomes 0 if the last test case had `k > (n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `g` is 0.
- **`f`**: Will be `k - g` if the last test case had `k > (n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `f` is not defined.
- **`y`**: Will be `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)` if the last test case had `k > (n + 1) // 2`, otherwise `y` is not defined.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **t is 0, n and k are the values from the last test case, s is the cumulative sum if k > (n + 1) // 2, i is the number of iterations if k > (n + 1) // 2, d is 0 if k > (n + 1) // 2, h is 0 if k > (n + 1) // 2, p is i if k > (n + 1) // 2, g is the sum of (h + 1) // 2 if k > (n + 1) // 2, f is k - g if k > (n + 1) // 2, y is 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1) if k > (n + 1) // 2.**
