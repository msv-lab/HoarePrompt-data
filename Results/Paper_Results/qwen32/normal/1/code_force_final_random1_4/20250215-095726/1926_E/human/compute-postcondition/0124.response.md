Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than half of `n`, it performs a series of calculations involving cumulative sums and powers of two to determine the output. Otherwise, it directly computes the output as `2 * k - 1`.**
