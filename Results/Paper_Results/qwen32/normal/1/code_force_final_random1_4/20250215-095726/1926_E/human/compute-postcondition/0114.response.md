The code snippet provided only modifies the variable `p` by incrementing its value by 1. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 1
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `k` is the second integer from the input
- `s` is the accumulated sum until `d` becomes 0 or `s` reaches `k`
- `i` must be at least 4
- `d` is 0
- `h` is \(\frac{h_{\text{initial}} - 7}{8}\)
- `p` is 3
- `g` is `g + (h + 1) // 2`

After executing `p += 1`, the new value of `p` is 4.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `s` is the accumulated sum until `d` becomes 0 or `s` reaches `k`, `i` must be at least 4, `d` is 0, `h` is \(\frac{h_{\text{initial}} - 7}{8}\), `p` is 4, `g` is `g + (h + 1) // 2`.**
