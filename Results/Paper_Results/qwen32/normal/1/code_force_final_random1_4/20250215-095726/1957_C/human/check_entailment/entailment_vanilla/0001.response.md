Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Game Rules**:
   - Players take turns placing rooks on an n x n chessboard.
   - The player places a white rook at (r, c).
   - The computer mirrors this move by placing a black rook at (c, r).
   - If r == c, the computer skips its turn.
   - No two rooks can attack each other (i.e., no two rooks can be in the same row or column).

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the number of distinct final configurations of the board after k moves by the player and the corresponding responses by the computer.
   - Output the count modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Constraints**:
   - Multiple test cases (up to \(10^4\)).
   - Large board sizes (up to \(3 \cdot 10^5\)).
   - Up to \(n\) moves per test case.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of ways to fill the board for different sizes.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to fill an i x i board without any initial moves.
   - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation is `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2*(i-1)*dp[i-2]) % 1000000007`.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` computes the values of `dp` up to `n = 300000`.
   - This is done once before processing any test cases, making the solution efficient for large boards.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of coordinates `(r, c)` representing the moves.
   - It adds both `r` and `c` to a set `invalid` to track rows and columns that are already occupied.
   - The number of remaining valid positions is `n - len(invalid)`.
   - The result for the test case is `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which is the number of ways to fill the remaining board.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `len(invalid) >= n` by ensuring `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])` is used, preventing negative indices.
   - The program efficiently handles large inputs due to the precomputation of `dp` values.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem using dynamic programming. It precomputes the number of ways to fill the board for different sizes and efficiently processes each test case by leveraging these precomputed values.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
