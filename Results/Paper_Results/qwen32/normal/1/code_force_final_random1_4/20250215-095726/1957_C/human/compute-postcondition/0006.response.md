The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Given that `i` was 3 at the start of the first iteration inside the loop, and it gets incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if the previous iteration ended with `i` being some value `x`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration other than it being within the bounds of the loop, we can generalize that if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

However, since we know the loop starts with `i = 3` and increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration, if the previous iteration ended with `i = x`, the next iteration should start with `i = x + 1`.

Let's assume the previous iteration ended with `i` being some value `x` where `3 <= x < n`. The next iteration should start with `i = x + 1`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `x`, we can say that if the loop just finished with `i = x`, the next iteration will start with `i = x + 1`. Given that the loop is currently processing `i` and will increment it, the state at the start of the next iteration would be `i` incremented by 1.

Therefore, if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, `i` is incremented by 1**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, `i` is `x + 1`** where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. 

To be specific, if the previous iteration ended with `i = 3`, the next iteration will start with `i = 4`. If the previous iteration ended with `i = 4`, the next iteration will start with `i = 5`, and so on.

So, if we assume the previous iteration ended with `i = x`, the next iteration will start with `i = x + 1`.

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume the previous iteration ended with `i = 3` (the first iteration inside the loop). The next iteration will start with `i = 4`.
