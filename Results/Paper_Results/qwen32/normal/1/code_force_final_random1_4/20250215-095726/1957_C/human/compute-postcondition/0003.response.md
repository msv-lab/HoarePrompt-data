The given code snippet calculates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. This calculation updates the `dp` array starting from index `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3

The code snippet specifically computes `dp[i]` for some `i` (which is not specified in the provided context, but it's implied that `i` is greater than 2 since `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` are already defined).

After executing the code snippet, the value of `dp[i]` is updated according to the formula provided. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `dp[1]`, and `dp[2]` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`**

This means that `dp[i]` now holds the newly computed value based on the formula, while all other variables retain their initial values.
