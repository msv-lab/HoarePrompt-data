#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: dp[n] is the value computed by the loop for the given n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` computes and returns a specific value based on the integer `n`, using a dynamic programming approach. The returned value is stored in `dp[n]` and represents the result of a computation involving the sequence defined by the recurrence relation provided in the code.
