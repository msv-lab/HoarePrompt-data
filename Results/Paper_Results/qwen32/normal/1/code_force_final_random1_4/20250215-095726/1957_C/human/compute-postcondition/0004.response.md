The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that the loop iterates from `3` to `n` inclusive, and at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was used to compute `dp[i]`, the value of `i` should be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value between `3` and `n`.
- The loop increments `i` by 1 after each iteration.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Since the loop condition is `for i in range(3, n + 1)`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Given that the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration other than it being within the loop bounds, we can generalize that `i` should simply be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, `i` is incremented by 1**
