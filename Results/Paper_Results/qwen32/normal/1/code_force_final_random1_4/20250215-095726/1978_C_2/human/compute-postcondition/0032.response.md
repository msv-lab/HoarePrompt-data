The code `l.pop(-1)` removes the last element from the list `l`. Given the initial state, the list `l` starts with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from `2` to `n-1`.

If `n == 1`, the list `l` is simply `[n-1]`, which means `l` is `[0]`. After executing `l.pop(-1)`, the list `l` becomes empty.

If `n > 1`, the list `l` initially looks like this: `[n-1, n, 2, 3, ..., n-2, n-1]`. After executing `l.pop(-1)`, the last element (`n-1`) is removed, and the list `l` becomes `[n-1, n, 2, 3, ..., n-2]`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) that is not equal to 0; `l` is `[n-1, n, 2, 3, ..., n-2]` if `n > 1` or `l` is `[]` if `n == 1`; `i` is `i`; `x` is `n-1`.**
