The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n, -1, -2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

- The loop starts with `i` initialized to `n` and decrements `i` by 2 in each iteration until `i` becomes less than `-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1.

To find the state at the start of the next iteration:
- Since the loop decrements `i` by 2, the next value of `i` should be `1 - 2 = -1`.

However, since the loop condition is `i` in the range from `n` to `-1` with a step of `-2`, when `i` becomes `-1`, the loop will terminate because `-1` is not greater than `-1`.

Thus, the loop will not execute another iteration if `i` is set to `-1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration does not exist because the loop terminates.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is a non-negative integer equal to the initial `k` (unchanged), `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `i` is -1, and the loop terminates**.

Since the loop terminates, there is no next iteration to consider. However, if we were to strictly follow the pattern of adjusting variables in the loop head, we would say:

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is a non-negative integer equal to the initial `k` (unchanged), `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `i` is -1**.
