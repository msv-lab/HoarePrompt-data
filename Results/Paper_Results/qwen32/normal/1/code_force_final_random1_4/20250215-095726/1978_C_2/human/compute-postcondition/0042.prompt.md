You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12).
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if 1 + i > k:
            x = l[-1]
            l.pop(-1)
            l.insert(-k, x)
            return l
        
        k = k - i + 1
        
        x = l[-1]
        
        l.pop(-1)
        
        l.insert(0, x)
        
    #State: the list `l` is rotated such that the first `k` elements are moved to the end of the list, and `k` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `k`, a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). Depending on the values of `n` and `k`, the function returns different lists as follows:
#
#- Case_1: If `k` is 0, the function returns a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`.
#- Case_2: If `k` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, the function returns a list `l` that contains integers from 1 to `n-1` with `n` inserted at position `-k` from the end of the list.
#- Case_3: If `k` equals `n`, the function returns a list `l` that starts with `n` and is followed by integers from 1 to `n-1` in ascending order.
#- Case_4: If `k` is greater than `n` and less than 2*n-1, the function returns a list `l` that starts with `n`, followed by integers from 1 to `n-2`, with `n-1` inserted at position `-k` from the end of the list.
#- Case_5: If `k` equals 2*n-1, the function returns a list `l` that starts with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 2 to `n-1`. If `n` equals 1, the list contains only `[n-1]`.
#- Case_6: If `k` is greater than or equal to 2*n-1 and `n` equals 1, the function returns `[0]`. Otherwise, it returns `[n-1]` if `n` is greater than 1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`.

Case_2: The program returns a list `l` that contains integers from 1 to `n-1` with `n` inserted at position `-k` from the end of the list.

Case_3: The program returns a list `l` that starts with `n` and is followed by integers from 1 to `n-1` in ascending order.

Case_4: The program returns a list `l` that starts with `n`, followed by integers from 1 to `n-2`, with `n-1` inserted at position `-k` from the end of the list.

Case_5: The program returns a list `l` that starts with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 2 to `n-1`. If `n == 1`, the list contains only `[n-1]`.

Case_6: The program returns `[0]` if `n == 1`, otherwise it returns `[n-1]` if `n > 1`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
