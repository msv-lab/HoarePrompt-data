Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that the Manhattan value \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \) equals \( k \).
- If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".
- If such a permutation exists, we should output "Yes" followed by the permutation.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of several functions, and the main logic seems to be in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. Here's a summary of what these functions do:

- **`func_1(n, k)`**: This function generates a permutation of length \( n \) with a Manhattan value of \( k \). It divides \( k \) by 2 and iteratively adjusts the permutation until the required Manhattan value is achieved.
- **`func_2(c, k, l)`**: This function swaps elements in the permutation to adjust the Manhattan value.
- **`func_3(c, l)`**: This function swaps elements in the permutation to adjust the Manhattan value.
- **`func_4()`**: This function reads input values \( n \) and \( k \), checks if \( k \) is even, and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for the given \( n \).
- **`func_5(l)`**: This function prints the permutation.
- **`func_6()`**: This function orchestrates the process by reading input, checking conditions, and calling other functions to generate and print the permutation.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Even Check for \( k \)**: The program checks if \( k \) is even (`if k % 2`). According to the problem statement, \( k \) can be any integer between 0 and \( 10^{12} \). However, the Manhattan value is always even because it is the sum of absolute differences, which are always even when summed over an even number of terms. Therefore, this check is unnecessary and might incorrectly reject valid inputs where \( k \) is odd.
2. **Maximum Manhattan Value Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value as \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \) for odd \( n \) and \( \frac{n^2}{2} \) for even \( n \). This calculation seems correct based on the problem constraints.
3. **Permutation Generation Logic**: The logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` is complex and involves swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value. While the logic seems to be designed to work, it is not immediately clear that it handles all edge cases correctly without further analysis or testing.

### Testing Edge Cases:
To verify the correctness of the program, let's consider some edge cases:

1. **\( n = 1 \), \( k = 0 \)**: The only permutation is `[1]`, and its Manhattan value is 0. The program should output "Yes\n1".
2. **\( n = 1 \), \( k = 1 \)**: No permutation exists because the Manhattan value is always 0 for \( n = 1 \). The program should output "No".
3. **\( n = 2 \), \( k = 0 \)**: The only permutation is `[1, 2]`, and its Manhattan value is 0. The program should output "Yes\n1 2".
4. **\( n = 2 \), \( k = 2 \)**: The permutation `[2, 1]` has a Manhattan value of 2. The program should output "Yes\n2 1".
5. **\( n = 2 \), \( k = 1 \)**: No permutation exists because the Manhattan value is either 0 or 2. The program should output "No".

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and testing of edge cases, the program seems to handle some cases correctly but fails to handle cases where \( k \) is odd, which is a critical issue since the Manhattan value is always even. Additionally, the complexity of the permutation generation logic makes it difficult to verify correctness without extensive testing.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly rejects valid inputs where \( k \) is odd, even though the Manhattan value is always even. This makes the program incorrect for at least one potential case.
