The given code snippet only increments the value of `c` by 1. Since there is no initial value provided for `c` in the Initial State, we can only infer that its new value will be one more than whatever its previous value was. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `l`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is a non-negative integer equal to the initial `k` (unchanged), `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `i` is -1, `c` is increased by 1.**
