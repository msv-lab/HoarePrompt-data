Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`**

Explanation: The value of `n` remains a positive integer, and `k` remains a non-negative integer as per the initial state. The new variable `l` is introduced and is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1(n, k)`. No other variables are affected.
