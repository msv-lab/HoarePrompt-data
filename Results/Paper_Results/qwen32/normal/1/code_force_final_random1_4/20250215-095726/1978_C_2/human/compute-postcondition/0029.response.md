To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop progresses and the conditions under which it terminates.

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `n`: Length of the permutation.
   - `k`: Non-negative integer representing half of the original required Manhattan value.
   - `l`: List containing integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `c`: Counter initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Structure:**
   - The loop runs from `i = n` down to `-1` with a step of `-2`.
   - For each iteration:
     - Increment `c` by 1.
     - Check if `k == 0`. If true, return `l`.
     - Check if `k < i - 1`. If true, return `func_2(c, k, l)`.
     - Update `k` by subtracting `i - 1` from it.
     - Update `l` by calling `func_3(c, l)`.

3. **Termination Conditions:**
   - The loop terminates when `i` reaches `-1` or when either of the return conditions (`k == 0` or `k < i - 1`) is met during an iteration.

### Iteration Details:

- **First Iteration (`i = n`):**
  - `c` becomes 1.
  - If `k == 0`, return `l`.
  - If `k < n - 1`, return `func_2(1, k, l)`.
  - Otherwise, update `k` to `k - (n - 1)` and `l` to `func_3(1, l)`.

- **Second Iteration (`i = n-2`):**
  - `c` becomes 2.
  - If `k == 0`, return `l`.
  - If `k < n - 3`, return `func_2(2, k, l)`.
  - Otherwise, update `k` to `k - (n - 3)` and `l` to `func_3(2, l)`.

- **Third Iteration (`i = n-4`):**
  - `c` becomes 3.
  - If `k == 0`, return `l`.
  - If `k < n - 5`, return `func_2(3, k, l)`.
  - Otherwise, update `k` to `k - (n - 5)` and `l` to `func_3(3, l)`.

### General Pattern:
- The loop continues decrementing `i` by 2 each time.
- `c` increments by 1 with each iteration.
- `k` is updated by subtracting `i - 1` from it.
- `l` is updated by applying `func_3(c, l)`.

### Final Iteration:
- The loop terminates when `i` reaches `-1`.
- At this point, `c` will be `(n // 2) + 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2` if `n` is even.
- The final value of `k` and `l` will depend on the updates made during each iteration.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will terminate naturally when `i` reaches `-1`, unless a return condition (`k == 0` or `k < i - 1`) is met earlier.

### Output State:
- `n`: Remains unchanged.
- `k`: Updated based on the iterations.
- `l`: Updated based on `func_3(c, l)` calls.
- `c`: Number of iterations completed, which is `(n // 2) + 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2` if `n` is even.

**Output State:** **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is a non-negative integer updated based on the iterations, `l` is the result of multiple `func_3(c, l)` calls, and `c` is the number of iterations completed.**

In natural language, the final output state is that `n` remains the same, `k` has been adjusted based on the loop's operations, `l` has been transformed through multiple applications of `func_3`, and `c` reflects the total number of iterations the loop performed before reaching its termination condition.
