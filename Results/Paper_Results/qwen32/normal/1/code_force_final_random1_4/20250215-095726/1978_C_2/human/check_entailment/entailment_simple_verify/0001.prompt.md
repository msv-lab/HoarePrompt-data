You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic and functionality step by step:

### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires finding a permutation of length `n` such that its Manhattan value equals `k`. The Manhattan value is defined as the sum of absolute differences between each element in the permutation and its position index.

### Key Points:
1. **Permutation**: An array of `n` distinct integers from `1` to `n`.
2. **Manhattan Value**: Sum of `|p_i - i|` for `i` from `1` to `n`.
3. **Constraints**: `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `0 <= k <= 10^12`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **func_4()**: 
   - Reads `n` and `k` from input.
   - Checks if `k` is odd. If yes, returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value is always even.
   - Computes the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`.
     - For odd `n`: `(n^2 - 1) / 2`
     - For even `n`: `n^2 / 2`
   - If `k` exceeds this maximum, returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, returns `(n, k)`.

2. **func_1(n, k)**:
   - Divides `k` by `2` (since the Manhattan value is always even).
   - Initializes a list `l` with elements from `1` to `n`.
   - Iterates from `n` down to `1` in steps of `-2`.
   - Adjusts `l` to increase the Manhattan value until it reaches `k` or determines that it's impossible.

3. **func_2(c, k, l)**:
   - Swaps elements in `l` to adjust the Manhattan value by `k`.

4. **func_3(c, l)**:
   - Swaps elements in `l` to adjust the Manhattan value by `c`.

5. **func_5(l)**:
   - Prints "YES" followed by the permutation `l`.

6. **func_6()**:
   - Calls `func_4()` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is `0`, prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, calls `func_1(n, k)` to get the permutation and prints it using `func_5(l)`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic for Maximum Manhattan Value**:
   - The formula for the maximum Manhattan value seems incorrect. It should be `(n^2 - n) / 2` for both odd and even `n`.
   - This is because the maximum deviation occurs when the permutation is reversed, leading to `|n-1| + |n-2| + ... + |1-n|`.

2. **Adjusting the Permutation**:
   - The logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` is complex and may not correctly achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - There is no clear explanation or proof that these functions will always produce a valid permutation with the exact Manhattan value `k`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the logic for calculating the maximum Manhattan value and the complexity of adjusting the permutation, the program is likely incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
