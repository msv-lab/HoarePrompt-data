Output State: **The program returns the result of `func_2(2, k, l)`**

Explanation: Given the initial state, the program will execute the function `func_2` with the arguments `c` as 2, `k` as a non-negative integer (which could be any value depending on the initial `k` and `i`), and `l` as the result of `func_3(2, l)`. Since the condition `if k == 0` does not apply here (as the problem specifies the code continues with the return statement outside this condition), the final action is to return the result of `func_2(2, k, l)`.
