Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues:

1. The `func_1` function is defined after it is used in the main loop, which will result in a `NameError`.
2. The program precomputes the sum of digit sums for all numbers up to 200,000 and stores them in the list `A`. This is unnecessary because the input constraint for `n` can be up to 2 * 10^5, and the program should handle each test case independently.
3. The program reads the number of test cases and then reads each test case, but it does not reset the sum for each test case. Instead, it uses the precomputed sums, which is incorrect.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num // 10)  # Use integer division
    return a

for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total_sum += func_1(i)
    print(total_sum)
```

This version defines the `func_1` function before using it and calculates the sum of digit sums for each test case independently.
