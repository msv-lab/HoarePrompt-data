To determine what will be printed by the `print(pd[n])` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the relevant computations:

### Initial State Breakdown
- `t`: An input integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\) inclusive.
- `N`: A constant integer set to 200001.
- `pd`: A list where `pd[i]` for `i` from 1 to 200000 contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`.
- `i`: A constant integer set to 200001.
- `n`: An input integer.

### Understanding `pd` List
The list `pd` is constructed such that each element `pd[i]` represents the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`.

For example:
- `pd[1]` would be the sum of digits of number 1, which is 1.
- `pd[2]` would be the sum of digits of numbers 1 and 2, which is 1 + 2 = 3.
- `pd[11]` would be the sum of digits of numbers 1 through 11, which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + (1+0) + (1+1) = 50.

### Given Print Statement
The print statement is `print(pd[n])`, which means it will print the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Determining the Output
The output will be the value of `pd[n]`, which is the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`. Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `pd[n]`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

### Final Output Description
Output: **pd[n] (where pd[n] is the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to n)**
