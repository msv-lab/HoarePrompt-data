### Reasoning:

The program aims to compute the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to \( n \) for multiple test cases. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Precomputation**:
   - The program precomputes the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores them in the list `A`.
   - For each number `i` from 1 to 200,000, it calculates the sum of its digits using the function `func_1` and adds this to the cumulative sum stored in `sum`. This cumulative sum is then appended to the list `A`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `num` and computes the sum of its digits.
   - It does this by repeatedly taking the last digit of `num` (using `num % 10`), adding it to `a`, and then removing the last digit from `num` (using integer division `num // 10`).
   - The function correctly returns the sum of the digits of `num`.

3. **Handling Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and prints the precomputed cumulative sum of digit sums up to `n` from the list `A`.

4. **Correctness of Precomputation**:
   - The precomputation step ensures that for any input `n` up to 200,000, the program can quickly retrieve the answer by simply indexing into the list `A`.
   - Since the problem guarantees that `n` will not exceed 200,000, this approach is efficient and within the time constraints.

5. **Correctness of Output**:
   - For each test case, the program outputs the correct cumulative sum of digit sums up to `n` by accessing the precomputed value in `A`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly precomputes the required values and efficiently handles the input to produce the correct output for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
