Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Precomputation of Sums:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` set to 0.
   - It then iterates over all integers from 1 to 200,000 (inclusive).
   - For each integer `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits using the function `func_1`.
   - This digit sum is added to the cumulative `sum`.
   - The cumulative `sum` is then appended to the list `A`.

2. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It then prints the value at index `n-1` of the precomputed list `A`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes an integer `num` and returns the sum of its digits.
   - It does so by repeatedly taking the last digit (`num % 10`), adding it to a running total `a`, and removing the last digit (`num = int(num / 10)`) until `num` becomes 0.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Indexing Error:**
   - The program attempts to access `A[n-1]` for each test case `n`.
   - However, the list `A` is precomputed up to the cumulative sum of digit sums for numbers from 1 to 200,000.
   - The issue arises when `n` is greater than the length of `A` (which is 200,000). For such values of `n`, the program will attempt to access an index outside the bounds of `A`, leading to an error.

2. **Efficiency Concerns:**
   - Precomputing the cumulative sum for all numbers up to 200,000 is unnecessary and inefficient for the given constraints.
   - The program should compute the required cumulative sum directly for each test case `n` instead of precomputing it for all possible values up to 200,000.

### Conclusion:

Given the identified issues, particularly the potential out-of-bounds error and inefficiency, the program is not correct according to the problem description.

**Correctness:** **False**
