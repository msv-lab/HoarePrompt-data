Output State: **t is 0, N is 200001, pd is a list where pd[i] for i from 1 to 200000 contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to i, i is 200001.**

Natural Language Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variables `N`, `pd`, and `i` remain unchanged throughout the loop as they are not modified within the loop body. The variable `n` is an input integer that is used within each iteration but does not affect the overall state after the loop completes.
