Output State: **`t` is an integer, `N` is 200001, `i` is `t`, `pd[t]` is `pd[t] + pd[t - 1] + int(j) + int(j) + int(j)`**

Explanation: The value of `pd[i]` (which is `pd[t]` since `i` is `t`) is updated by adding `int(j)` to its current value. Initially, `pd[t]` was `pd[t] + pd[t - 1] + int(j) + int(j)`. After executing the line `pd[i] += int(j)`, `pd[t]` becomes `pd[t] + pd[t - 1] + int(j) + int(j) + int(j)`. The values of `t`, `N`, and `i` remain unchanged.
