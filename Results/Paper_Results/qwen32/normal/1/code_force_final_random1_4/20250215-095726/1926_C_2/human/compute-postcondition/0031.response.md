In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning its value is not used within the loop. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations specified.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
- `N` is 200001.
- `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` for `i` from 1 to 200000 contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`.
- `i` is 200001.

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variable `t` (since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution).

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute `t` times, so `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
- The values of `N`, `pd`, and `i` are not directly related to the execution of the loop; they are part of the program state but do not influence whether the loop runs or not.

### Conclusion:
The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure that the loop executes. Since `t` is already described as being between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, it is already in a valid state to ensure the loop executes at least once.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes, as it is already guaranteed to be within the valid range.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` for `i` from 1 to 200000 contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`, and `i` is 200001**.
