Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each of the `t` test cases, it accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the value of `n` for that test case.**
