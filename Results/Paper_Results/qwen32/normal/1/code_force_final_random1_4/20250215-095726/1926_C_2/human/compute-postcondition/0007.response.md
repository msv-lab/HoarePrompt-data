To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the provided state.

The `while` loop condition is:
```
while num != 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means the loop will continue as long as `num` is not equal to 0. However, `num` is described as "a list of integers with each element's last digit removed." A list cannot be equal to an integer (0 in this case), so the condition `num != 0` is always true if `num` is a non-empty list. 

Given this, the loop will continue to execute as long as `num` is not an empty list. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `num` must still be a non-empty list.

Since the only variable in the loop head is `num`, we need to ensure that `num` remains a non-empty list. The state of `a` does not affect the loop condition and thus does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state should be modified to ensure `num` is a non-empty list. Hereâ€™s the adjusted state:

State: **`num` is a non-empty list of integers with each element's last digit removed, `a` is updated to its original value plus the sum of the last digits of each element in the original `num`.**
