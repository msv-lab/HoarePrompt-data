To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over each character in the string representation of the variable `i`.

Given the loop:
```python
for j in str(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which is assigned values from the string representation of `i`. Therefore, the key variable we need to consider is `i`.

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `str(i)` produces a non-empty string.
- Since `i` is already given as 4, `str(i)` will be `"4"`, which is a non-empty string.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute because `i` is already set to 4, and `str(4)` results in a non-empty string.

Thus, the state remains unchanged with respect to the loop's ability to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[i]` which is the sum of the digits of `i` for each `i` from 1 to `t` with `pd[4]` being 7, `i` is 4**
