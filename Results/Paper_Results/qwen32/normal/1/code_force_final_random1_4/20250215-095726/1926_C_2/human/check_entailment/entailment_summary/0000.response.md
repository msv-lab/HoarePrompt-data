Reasoning:  
The provided execution summary indicates a misunderstanding or misstatement of the issue with the function `func_1`. The function `func_1` is correctly designed to compute the sum of the digits of a single integer. It does not treat `num` as a list; instead, it processes each digit of the integer `num` correctly using the modulus and division operations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` set to 0.
2. It then iterates over all integers from 1 to 200,000 (inclusive).
3. For each integer `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits using the `func_1` function and adds this value to the cumulative `sum`.
4. The cumulative `sum` is then appended to the list `A`.
5. After precomputing the sums for all values up to 200,000, the program reads the number of test cases `t`.
6. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and prints the precomputed sum stored in `A[n-1]`.

Given that `func_1` works correctly and the program precomputes the sums accurately, the program should produce the correct results for the given problem.

However, there is a potential issue with the execution summary stating that `func_1` always returns 0, which is incorrect based on the provided code. Assuming the code is executed as written, the program should work correctly.

Correctness: **True**
