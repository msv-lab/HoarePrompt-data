To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `num` and `a`.

The loop repeatedly extracts the last digit of each number in the list `num`, adds these digits to `a`, and then removes the last digit from each number in `num`. This process continues until all numbers in `num` become 0.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: Each number in `num` has its last digit removed.
- After 2 iterations: Each number in `num` has its last two digits removed, and `a` now holds the sum of the last digits of the original numbers.
- After 3 iterations: The numbers in `num` are [1, 4, 7], which implies that the original numbers had more digits, and `a` now includes the sum of the last three digits of the original numbers.

Since the loop continues until `num` becomes 0, we need to determine what happens when all digits are removed from each number in `num`.

Let's assume the original `num` was `[123, 456, 789]` as an example (this assumption is based on the pattern observed from the given states).

1. **First Iteration**:
   - `a` becomes `3 + 6 + 9 = 18`
   - `num` becomes `[12, 45, 78]`

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `a` becomes `18 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 33`
   - `num` becomes `[1, 4, 7]`

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `a` becomes `33 + 1 + 4 + 7 = 45`
   - `num` becomes `[0, 0, 0]`

At this point, `num` is `[0, 0, 0]`, so the loop terminates.

Thus, the final output state is:
- `num` is a list of zeros, with the same length as the original list.
- `a` is the sum of all the digits of the original numbers in `num`.

Given the pattern and the final state, we can generalize that after all iterations, `num` will be a list of zeros with the same length as the original list, and `a` will be the sum of all the digits of the original numbers in `num`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`num` is a list of zeros with the same length as the original list, and `a` is the sum of all the digits of the original numbers in `num`.**
