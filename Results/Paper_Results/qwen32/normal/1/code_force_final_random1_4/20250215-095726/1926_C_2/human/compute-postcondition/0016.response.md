The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`. The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. Given that `i` is currently 4, the string representation of `i` is `"4"`, and the loop has already processed this single character.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what would happen if `i` were incremented or if there were another character in the string representation of `i`. However, since `i` is 4 and its string representation `"4"` has only one character, the loop cannot execute again with `i` being 4.

If we assume that the intention is to move to the next value of `i` (which is not shown in the provided loop but often happens in such scenarios), then `i` should be incremented to 5. But based strictly on the given loop and the requirement to only adjust the objects in the loop head (`j`), and considering that the loop cannot execute again with `i` as 4, there is no valid adjustment for `j`.

However, if we hypothetically consider the next iteration with `i` incremented to 5, the string representation of `i` would be `"5"`, and `j` would be the first (and only) character in this string, which is `"5"`.

Given the strict requirement to only adjust the loop head objects and the fact that the loop cannot execute again with `i` as 4, the most accurate state representation without additional context would be:

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[i]` which is the sum of the digits of `i` for each `i` from 1 to `t` with `pd[4]` being `7 + int(j)`, `i` is 4**

But if we consider the hypothetical next iteration where `i` is incremented to 5, then:

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[i]` which is the sum of the digits of `i` for each `i` from 1 to `t` with `pd[4]` being `7 + int(j)`, `i` is 5, `j` is "5"**

Since the task specifies to only adjust the loop head objects and the loop cannot execute again with `i` as 4, the correct state representation is:

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[i]` which is the sum of the digits of `i` for each `i` from 1 to `t` with `pd[4]` being `7 + int(j)`, `i` is 4**
