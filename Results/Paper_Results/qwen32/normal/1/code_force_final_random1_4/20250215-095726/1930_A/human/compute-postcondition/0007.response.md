The code snippet `score += l[i]` adds the value of `l[i]` to the current value of `score`. Given the initial state, `score` was initially set to `l[i + 2]`. After executing the code, `score` will now be `l[i + 2] + l[i]`.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `l` remains a sorted list of integers.
- `i` remains `i + 2`.
- `score` is now `l[i + 2] + l[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 2`, `score` is `l[i + 2] + l[i]`**.
