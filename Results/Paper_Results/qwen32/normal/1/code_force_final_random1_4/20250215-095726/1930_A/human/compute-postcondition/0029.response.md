The value of `score` is updated by adding the element at index `i` of the list `l` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is the previous `score` plus `l[i]`.**
