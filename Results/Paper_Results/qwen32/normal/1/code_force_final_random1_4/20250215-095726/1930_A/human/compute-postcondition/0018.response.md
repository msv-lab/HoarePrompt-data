To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and implicitly the list `l` since it is being indexed by `i`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000 (this variable does not change within the loop)
- `n` must be greater than 0 (this variable does not change within the loop)
- `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the new input (this list does not change within the loop)
- `score` is the previous `score` plus `l[i]` (this variable is updated within the loop but is not part of the loop head)

The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration:
```python
for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, let's say `i = k`. Since `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 2`.

Let's determine the new value of `i`:
- If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 2`.

The values of `n` and `l` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**

Since we don't have the exact value of `k`, we can express the state as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is incremented by 2 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**

If we assume `i` was 0 at the start of the first iteration, then at the start of the second iteration `i` would be 2, and so on. For the general case, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration `i` is `k + 2`.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is incremented by 2 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**
