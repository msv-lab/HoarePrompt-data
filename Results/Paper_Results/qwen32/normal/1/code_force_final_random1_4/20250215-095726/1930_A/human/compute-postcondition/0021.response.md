The value of `score` is incremented by the value of `l[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `l` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 2 before this operation, so its value is already updated from the previous iteration.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is incremented by 2 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `score` is increased by `l[i]`.**
