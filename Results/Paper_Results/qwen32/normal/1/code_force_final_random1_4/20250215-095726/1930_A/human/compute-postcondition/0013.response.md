The code snippet provided is simply reading an integer input and assigning it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is provided as input. The values of `t`, `l`, and `score` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is the sum of elements at even indices of `l` (i.e., `l[0] + l[2] + l[4] + ... + l[2*(n-1)]`)**
