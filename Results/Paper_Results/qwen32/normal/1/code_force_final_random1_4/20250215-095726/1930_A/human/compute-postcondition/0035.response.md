Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000 (This variable is not directly used in the provided code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output of the `print(score)` statement).
- `n` is the integer value from the input (This represents the number of elements in the list `l`).
- `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the input (This list is sorted in ascending order).
- `score` is the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2*(n-1) of the list `l`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(score)
```

### Explanation:
The variable `score` is calculated as the sum of elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the sorted list `l`. Since `l` is sorted in ascending order, the elements at these even indices are the smallest, third smallest, fifth smallest, and so on.

To determine the exact value of `score`, we need to know the specific values in the list `l`. However, since the exact values of `l` are not provided, we can only describe `score` in terms of the sorted list `l`.

### Output Description:
The `print(score)` statement will output the sum of the elements located at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the sorted list `l`.

Given this, the final output is described as:

Output: **score (where score is the sum of elements at even indices of the sorted list `l`)**
