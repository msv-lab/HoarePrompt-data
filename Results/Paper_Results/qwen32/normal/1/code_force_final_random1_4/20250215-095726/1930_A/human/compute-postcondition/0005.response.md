The code snippet `score += l[i]` increments the `score` variable by the value of the element at index `i` in the list `l`. Since the initial state specifies that `score` is 0, after executing this line, `score` will be equal to `l[i]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is `l[i]`**.
