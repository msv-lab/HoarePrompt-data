To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. To achieve the highest possible score, it makes sense to always pick the smallest available numbers first because the smaller number in each pair will be added to the score.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads an integer `n` which indicates that there are `2n` integers.
2. It reads `2n` integers and sorts them in ascending order.
3. It initializes the score to 0.
4. It iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first (i.e., indices 0, 2, 4, ...), and adds these elements to the score.
5. Finally, it prints the score for that test case.

### Correctness:
By sorting the list and picking every second element starting from the first, the program effectively picks the smallest numbers in each pair, ensuring that the sum of the minimums is maximized. This approach aligns perfectly with the optimal strategy described in the problem analysis.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
