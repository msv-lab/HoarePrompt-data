To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `i`, `n`, and implicitly the list `l` since it's being indexed by `i`.

Here's the given information:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the input.
- `score` is the previous `score` plus `l[i]`.

The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration:
```python
for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 2.
   - Therefore, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `x + 2` at the start of the next iteration.

2. **Range Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.
   - If `i` is currently `x`, then for the loop to continue, `x + 2` must be less than `2 * n`.

3. **Adjusting `i`:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 2, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `i + 2`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged because they are not modified in the loop head.
   - `score` is recalculated within the loop body, so it does not affect the loop head.

### Conclusion:

Given that `i` is incremented by 2, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change. Therefore, the state will be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `i + 2`**.

Since `i` is not explicitly provided in the initial state, we express the new state in terms of the old `i` value.

Final State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is the new sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `i + 2`**.
