The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used as the loop counter. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `_` remain unchanged during each iteration of the loop. Since `_` is the loop counter, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be incremented by 1.

Given that `_` is currently 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `_` is 2. If `4 * n - 2 == k`, the program executes the if part; otherwise, it executes the else part. In both cases, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `_` remain unchanged.**
