You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. If `k` equals `4n - 2`, it prints `k // 2 + 1`; otherwise, it prints the ceiling of `k / 2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total in an \( n \times n \) grid.
- For each test case, we need to output the minimum number of cells to color.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \). It then calculates the minimum number of cells to color using the following logic:
- If \( 4n - 2 = k \), it prints \( k // 2 + 1 \).
- Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

### Potential Issues:
Let's consider the logic behind this solution:
- When \( k = 4n - 2 \), it means all diagonals need to have at least one colored cell. In this case, the formula \( k // 2 + 1 \) seems incorrect because it suggests coloring more cells than necessary. The correct approach would be to color exactly \( n \) cells (one per row or column) to cover all diagonals.
- For other values of \( k \), the formula \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) might not always yield the minimum number of cells required. This is because the diagonals overlap, and coloring cells strategically can reduce the number of cells needed.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with some edge cases:
1. **Case 1:** \( n = 3 \), \( k = 4 \)
   - Expected output: 2 (coloring two cells can cover 4 diagonals).
   - Program output: 2 (correct).
2. **Case 2:** \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \)
   - Expected output: 2 (coloring two cells can cover 3 diagonals).
   - Program output: 2 (correct).
3. **Case 3:** \( n = 3 \), \( k = 10 \)
   - Expected output: 6 (coloring six cells can cover all 10 diagonals).
   - Program output: 6 (correct).
4. **Case 4:** \( n = 3 \), \( k = 9 \)
   - Expected output: 5 (coloring five cells can cover 9 diagonals).
   - Program output: 5 (correct).
5. **Case 5:** \( n = 4 \), \( k = 7 \)
   - Expected output: 4 (coloring four cells can cover 7 diagonals).
   - Program output: 4 (correct).
6. **Case 6:** \( n = 7 \), \( k = 11 \)
   - Expected output: 6 (coloring six cells can cover 11 diagonals).
   - Program output: 6 (correct).
7. **Case 7:** \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)
   - Expected output: 2 (coloring two cells can cover 3 diagonals).
   - Program output: 2 (correct).

### Conclusion:
While the program passes the provided examples, the logic for calculating the minimum number of cells to color is flawed. Specifically, the formula \( k // 2 + 1 \) for \( k = 4n - 2 \) is incorrect, and the formula \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) might not always yield the minimum number of cells due to diagonal overlaps.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when \( k = 4n - 2 \) correctly and might not always yield the minimum number of cells to color due to diagonal overlaps.
