Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the next line from the input file (after the current `s`), `n` is the first integer from the split string of the new `s`, and `k` is the second integer from the split string of the new `s`. If `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, then the program proceeds accordingly; otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.**
