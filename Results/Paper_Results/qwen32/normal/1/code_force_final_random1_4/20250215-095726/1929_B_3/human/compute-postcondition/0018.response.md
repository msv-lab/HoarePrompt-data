To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each iteration based on the given conditions.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each iteration, the loop reads two integers `n` and `k`.
- It checks if `k` equals `4 * n - 2`. If true, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.
- If false, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

### Iteration Process:
Each iteration of the loop processes a pair of integers (`n`, `k`) and outputs a value based on the condition. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` change with each iteration, but the overall state outside the loop (like `t`) remains consistent in terms of its role as the counter for the loop.

### Final Output State:
After all `t` iterations, the loop will have processed all input pairs (`n`, `k`) and printed the corresponding results. The variables `n` and `k` will reflect the values from the last iteration, and `_` (the loop counter) will be equal to `t`.

### Output State Description:
- `t`: The loop counter, which will be equal to the initial value of `t` after all iterations.
- `n` and `k`: The values from the last iteration of the loop.
- `_`: The loop counter, which will be equal to `t` after the loop finishes.

Since the problem asks for the output state in terms of the final values of the variables involved in the loop, we can summarize the final state as follows:

Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and the final values are `t` (unchanged), `n` and `k` from the last iteration, and `_` equal to `t`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to `t`, and `n` and `k` will hold the values from the last test case processed. The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the process.
