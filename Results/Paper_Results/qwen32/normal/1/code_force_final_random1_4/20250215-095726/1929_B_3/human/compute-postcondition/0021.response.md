The only object in the loop head is the variable `s`, which iterates over the lines of the input file starting from the second line. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `s` to reflect the next line in the input file.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `s` is the next line from the input file
- `n` is the first integer from the split string `s`
- `k` is the second integer from the split string `s`

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` needs to be updated to the subsequent line from the input file. The values of `n` and `k` will be recalculated based on this new line.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the next line from the input file (after the current `s`), `n` is the first integer from the split string of the new `s`, and `k` is the second integer from the split string of the new `s`**
