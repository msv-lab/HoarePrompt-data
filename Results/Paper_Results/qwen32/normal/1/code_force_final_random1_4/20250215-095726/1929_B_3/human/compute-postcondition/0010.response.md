To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `_` is set to 1, but it is also not used in the provided code snippet.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The expression `k // 2` performs integer division of `k` by 2. This means it divides `k` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
- Adding 1 to the result of `k // 2` shifts the result up by one.

### Output Description:
The code will print the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`. Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

### Final Output:
Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is an integer read from the input)**
