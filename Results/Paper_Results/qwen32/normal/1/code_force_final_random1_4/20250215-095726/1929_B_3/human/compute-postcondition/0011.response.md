To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `_` is set to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ceil(k / 2))
```

### Analysis:
- The `ceil` function is used to round up the division result to the nearest integer.
- The expression `k / 2` performs floating-point division of `k` by 2.
- The `ceil` function then rounds this result up to the nearest whole number.

### Determining the Output:
- Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical output.
- However, we can describe the output in terms of `k`.

### Explanation:
- If `k` is an even number, `k / 2` will be an integer, and `ceil(k / 2)` will return the same integer.
- If `k` is an odd number, `k / 2` will result in a non-integer value, and `ceil(k / 2)` will round it up to the next whole number.

### Final Output Description:
The code prints the ceiling of `k / 2`, which means it prints the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where ceil(k / 2) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k / 2)**
