You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.

    t = int(input())

        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and the final values are `t` (unchanged), `n` and `k` from the last iteration, and `_` equal to `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. If `k` equals `4n - 2`, it prints `k // 2 + 1`; otherwise, it prints the ceiling of `k / 2`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The grid has a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals.

### Key Observations

1. **Diagonals in the Grid:**
   - There are \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right.
   - There are \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left.
   - Total diagonals: \( (2n - 1) + (2n - 1) - 1 = 4n - 2 \).

2. **Coloring Strategy:**
   - To minimize the number of colored cells while covering \( k \) diagonals, we can strategically place cells on the diagonals.
   - For example, placing a cell on the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) will cover one of these diagonals and also potentially intersect with another diagonal (top-right to bottom-left), thus covering two diagonals with one cell.

### Solution Explanation

The provided solution uses the following logic:

- If \( k = 4n - 2 \), it means we need to cover all diagonals. In this case, the formula \( k // 2 + 1 \) seems to be used, but this is incorrect. Covering all diagonals would require \( n \) cells (one per row or column).
- Otherwise, the solution uses \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). This formula suggests that each cell can cover up to two diagonals, so we need at least half the number of diagonals rounded up to ensure all \( k \) diagonals are covered.

### Testing the Solution

Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1: \( n = 3, k = 4 \)**
   - Expected Output: 2
   - Calculation: \( \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
   - Correct.

2. **Test Case 2: \( n = 3, k = 3 \)**
   - Expected Output: 2
   - Calculation: \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
   - Correct.

3. **Test Case 3: \( n = 3, k = 10 \)**
   - Expected Output: 6
   - Calculation: \( \lceil \frac{10}{2} \rceil = 5 \)
   - Incorrect. The correct answer is 6 because we need to cover more diagonals, and the formula does not account for the specific placement of cells.

4. **Test Case 4: \( n = 3, k = 9 \)**
   - Expected Output: 5
   - Calculation: \( \lceil \frac{9}{2} \rceil = 5 \)
   - Correct.

5. **Test Case 5: \( n = 4, k = 7 \)**
   - Expected Output: 4
   - Calculation: \( \lceil \frac{7}{2} \rceil = 4 \)
   - Correct.

6. **Test Case 6: \( n = 7, k = 11 \)**
   - Expected Output: 6
   - Calculation: \( \lceil \frac{11}{2} \rceil = 6 \)
   - Correct.

7. **Test Case 7: \( n = 2, k = 3 \)**
   - Expected Output: 2
   - Calculation: \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
   - Correct.

### Conclusion

The solution fails for Test Case 3 where \( n = 3, k = 10 \). The formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) does not correctly account for the specific placement of cells required to cover all diagonals in some cases.

Thus, the provided program is incorrect.
