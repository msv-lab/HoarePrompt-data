The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations left in the loop. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.

Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition directly, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`. After each iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the remaining number of iterations.

Given that `t` was at least 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it means the loop can still execute one more time if `t` is decremented to 0 or any positive value less than its current value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 999, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, `year` is the final value after processing all elements in `a` using the given loop logic.**
