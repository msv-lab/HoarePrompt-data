### Reasoning:
Let's break down the logic of the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The problem requires us to find the year in which the n-th sign occurs, considering that each subsequent sign can only occur after the previous one. Specifically, if the i-th sign occurs in year `x`, the next sign (i+1) can only occur in a year `y` such that `y > x` and `y` is a multiple of `a_(i+1)`.

Here's how the program works:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of signs `n`.
   - It reads the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `year` to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in `a`, it updates `year` using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`. This expression ensures that `year` is updated to the next multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current `year`.

Let's analyze the expression `year += year % ai or ai`:
- `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`. If this remainder is non-zero, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`.
- `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `ai` if `year % ai` is zero (meaning `year` is already a multiple of `ai`), and to `year % ai` otherwise.
- Adding this result to `year` effectively moves `year` to the next multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current `year`.

This logic correctly simulates the process of waiting for each sign to occur sequentially, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
