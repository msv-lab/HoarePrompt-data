To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand that the loop processes each test case in `test_cases`. For each test case, it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the list of integers provided in the test case and appends this LCM to the `results` list.

Hereâ€™s how the loop works:
- It iterates over each tuple in `test_cases`.
- For each tuple, it extracts the integer `n` and the list `a`.
- It initializes `current_year` to 0.
- It then iterates over each integer `ai` in `a`:
  - If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, it sets `next_year` to `current_year + ai`.
  - Otherwise, it sets `next_year` to the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
  - It updates `current_year` to `next_year`.
- After processing all integers in `a`, it appends the final `current_year` (which is the LCM of the list `a`) to the `results` list.

After all test cases are processed, the `results` list will contain the LCMs of the lists from each test case.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains the same as the initial state (integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000).
- `test_cases` remains the same as the initial state (list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers).
- `results` is a list containing the LCM of the list of integers from each tuple in `test_cases`.

In natural language, the final output state means that the `results` list will have as many elements as there are test cases in `test_cases`, with each element being the least common multiple of the integers in the corresponding test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), and `results` is a list containing the LCM of the list `a` from each tuple in `test_cases`.**
