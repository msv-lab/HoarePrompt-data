The code snippet increments `next_year` by the value of `ai`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `next_year`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6)
- `test` is the third tuple in `test_cases`
- `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the LCM of the first tuple's list `a` and the second being the LCM of the list `a` from the tuple `test`
- `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`
- `a` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must have at least two elements
- `ai` is the third element in the list `a`
- `current_year` is equal to `next_year`

After executing the code snippet `next_year = current_year + ai`, the value of `next_year` changes to `current_year + ai`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6); `test` is the third tuple in `test_cases`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the LCM of the first tuple's list `a` and the second being the LCM of the list `a` from the tuple `test`; `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must have at least two elements; `ai` is the third element in the list `a`; `current_year` is equal to `next_year` before the increment; `next_year` is `current_year + ai`.**
