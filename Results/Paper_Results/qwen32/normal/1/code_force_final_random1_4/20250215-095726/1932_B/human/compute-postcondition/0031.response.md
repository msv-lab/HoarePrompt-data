The only variable in the loop head is `ai`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `ai` and how it changes as the loop progresses.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ai` held the value of the current element from the list `a`. Since the loop iterates over each element in `a`, the next value of `ai` should be the next element in the list.

Given that `year` is the first element of the list `a`, if the previous iteration used `year` (the first element), then the next iteration should use the second element of the list `a`.

Let's denote the second element of the list `a` as `a[1]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ai` should be set to `a[1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 999, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `year` is the first element of the list `a`, `ai` is the second element of the list `a`**
