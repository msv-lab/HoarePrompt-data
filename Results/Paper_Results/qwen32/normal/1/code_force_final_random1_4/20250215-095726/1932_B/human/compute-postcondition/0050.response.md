The code snippet assigns `next_year` the value of `current_year + ai`. Given that `current_year` is 0 and `ai` is an element from the list `a` in the third tuple of `test_cases`, the value of `next_year` will be equal to `ai`.

Since `ai` is an element of the list `a` which is part of the third tuple in `test_cases`, and `a` must have at least one element, `ai` can be any integer from the list `a`.

Therefore, `next_year` will be equal to one of the integers in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), and the third tuple in `test_cases` must have a non-empty list as its second element; `test` is the third tuple in `test_cases`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the LCM of the first tuple's list `a` and the second being the LCM of the list `a` from the tuple `test`; `current_year` is 0 and `current_year % ai == 0` for some `ai` in the list `a` from the third tuple in `test_cases`; `next_year` is equal to `ai` where `ai` is an element of the list `a` from the third tuple in `test_cases`; `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must have at least one element.**
