The given code snippet simply assigns the value of `next_year` to `current_year`. This means that the value of `current_year` will now be the same as `next_year`.

Given the initial state, no other variables are affected by this assignment. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `test`, `results`, `n`, `a`, and `ai` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6); `test` is the third tuple in `test_cases`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the LCM of the first tuple's list `a` and the second being the LCM of the list `a` from the tuple `test`; `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must have at least two elements; `ai` is the third element in the list `a`; `current_year` is equal to `next_year`.**
