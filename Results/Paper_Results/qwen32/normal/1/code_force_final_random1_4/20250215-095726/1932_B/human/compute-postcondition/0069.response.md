Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list `results` where each element is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the integers in the corresponding tuple's list from `test_cases`.**
