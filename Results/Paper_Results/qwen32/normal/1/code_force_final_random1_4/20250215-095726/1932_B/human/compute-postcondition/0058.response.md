Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6); `test` is the third tuple in `test_cases`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the LCM of the first tuple's list `a` and the second being the LCM of the list `a` from the tuple `test`; `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must have at least two elements; `ai` is the second element in the list `a`. If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `current_year` is updated to `next_year - ai` and `next_year` is updated to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `current_year` remains unchanged and `next_year` is updated to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.**
