The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings separated by whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. This means that the variable `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

The variables `t` and `year` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet. The variable `n` is also not affected by this code snippet, so its value remains as the input integer provided initially.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 999, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `year` is the final value after processing all elements in `a` using the given loop logic.**
