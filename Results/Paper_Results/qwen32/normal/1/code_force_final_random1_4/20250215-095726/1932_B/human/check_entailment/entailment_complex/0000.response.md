### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and see if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

The program is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it performs the following steps:
1. Reads the number of signs, `n`.
2. Reads the list of periodicities, `a`, for these signs.
3. Initializes `year` to 0.
4. Iterates through each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`:
   - Updates `year` to the next occurrence of the sign with periodicity `ai` after the current `year`. This is done using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.
     - If `year % ai` is not zero, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, and we need to move forward to the next multiple of `ai`. The next multiple can be found by adding `ai - (year % ai)` to `year`. However, `year += year % ai or ai` is a concise way to achieve this because `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `ai - (year % ai)` if `year % ai` is not zero, and simply `ai` if `year % ai` is zero (meaning `year` is already a multiple of `ai`).
5. Prints the final `year` for each test case.

The key part here is the update of `year` inside the loop. The expression `year += year % ai or ai` ensures that `year` is always advanced to the next occurrence of the sign with periodicity `ai` after the current `year`. This correctly models the sequential occurrence of the signs as described in the problem statement.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:
- Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- Initial `year`: `0`
- First sign (`ai = 3`): `year` becomes `3` (next multiple of 3 after 0).
- Second sign (`ai = 2`): `year` becomes `4` (next multiple of 2 after 3).
- Third sign (`ai = 4`): `year` becomes `8` (next multiple of 4 after 4).
- Fourth sign (`ai = 5`): `year` becomes `10` (next multiple of 5 after 8).
- Fifth sign (`ai = 9`): `year` becomes `18` (next multiple of 9 after 10).
- Sixth sign (`ai = 18`): `year` becomes `36` (next multiple of 18 after 18).

This matches the expected output for the first test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens, based on the given periodicities of the signs.
