Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is the newly input integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input. The program checks if the first element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second element plus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second-to-last element plus 2. Regardless of whether the condition is true or false, the values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
