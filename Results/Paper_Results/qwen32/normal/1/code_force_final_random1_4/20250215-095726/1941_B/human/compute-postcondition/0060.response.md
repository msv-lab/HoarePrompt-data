Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` now being 0, `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged, `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged, `stop` is True if `a[i]` (which was originally less than 0) is less than 0; otherwise, `stop` remains False, `opNum` is `a[i]` (which was the original value before the operation), `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is less than 0, the loop or if statement is broken out of.**
