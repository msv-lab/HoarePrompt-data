The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `b` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the first element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second element plus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second-to-last element plus 2. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
