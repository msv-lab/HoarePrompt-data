Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. The logic in the program only checks if the first and last elements satisfy certain conditions, but it does not account for the entire array and the operations that can be performed on it.

Here is a counterexample where the program outputs "YES" but it should actually output "NO":

**Counterexample Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of Counterexample:**
- The array is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`.
- The first element `1` is odd, but the second element `2` is not `1 + 2`, so the condition `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2` is not met.
- The last element `1` is odd, but the second-to-last element `2` is not `1 + 2`, so the condition `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2` is not met.
- Since neither condition is met, the program outputs "YES".
- However, it is impossible to make all elements zero using the given operations because the middle element `3` cannot be reduced to zero without violating the constraints on the adjacent elements.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
