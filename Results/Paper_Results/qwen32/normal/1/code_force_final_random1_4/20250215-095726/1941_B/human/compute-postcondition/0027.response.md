The code snippet contains only a `break` statement, which means it will exit the nearest enclosing loop (such as a `for` or `while` loop). This does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or `stop`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 2, `stop` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
