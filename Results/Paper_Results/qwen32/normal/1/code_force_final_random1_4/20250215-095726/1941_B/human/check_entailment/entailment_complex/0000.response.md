### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem statement to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make all elements of an array `a` equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-1`) and performing the following changes:
- Decrement `a[i-1]` by 1.
- Decrement `a[i]` by 2.
- Decrement `a[i+1]` by 1.

This operation effectively reduces the sum of the array by 4 each time it is applied. For the array to be reduced to all zeros, the total sum of the array must be divisible by 4.

Additionally, the operation modifies three consecutive elements. This implies that the parity (odd/even nature) of the elements plays a crucial role. Specifically, the operation can only balance out the parities in a way that respects the constraints of the operation.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code does not implement the logic described above. Instead, it checks two specific conditions related to the first and last elements of the array:
1. If the first element (`b[0]`) is odd and the second element (`b[1]`) is not equal to the first element plus 2.
2. If the last element (`b[-1]`) is odd and the second-to-last element (`b[-2]`) is not equal to the last element plus 2.

If either of these conditions is true, the code outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

#### Evaluation:
The conditions checked in the code do not guarantee that the array can be reduced to all zeros. They only check specific relationships between the first and second elements, and the last and second-to-last elements. These conditions are not sufficient to determine the possibility of reducing the entire array to zeros using the allowed operation.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should:
1. Check if the total sum of the array is divisible by 4.
2. Ensure that the parities of the elements allow for the necessary adjustments through the operation.

Since the provided code does not perform these checks, it cannot correctly determine whether the array can be reduced to all zeros.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly check the necessary conditions to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros using the allowed operation.

Correctness: **False**
