Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. The logic in the program is too simplistic and does not account for the necessary conditions to solve the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the differences between consecutive elements follow a specific pattern that allows us to reduce all elements to zero through the described operations. Specifically, the differences between consecutive elements must be even and follow a pattern that can be reduced to zero through the operations.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the first element is odd
        if a[0] % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check the differences between consecutive elements
        for i in range(1, n):
            diff = a[i] - a[i-1]
            if diff % 2 != 0:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This program checks if the first element is even and then verifies that the difference between every pair of consecutive elements is even. If these conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. This approach ensures that the array can potentially be reduced to all zeros using the allowed operations.
