The code `a[i] -= opNum` modifies the value of `a[i]` by subtracting `opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is `a[i]`, the operation effectively sets `a[i]` to `a[i] - a[i]`, which results in `a[i]` being 0.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `i` is incremented by 1 (this condition remains unchanged).
- `n` is greater than 2 (this condition remains unchanged).
- `opNum` was `a[i]` before the operation, but now `a[i]` is 0, so `opNum` is no longer relevant to the current state of `a[i]`.
- If `a[i]` was less than 0 before the operation, `stop` would be True, and we would break out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, since `a[i]` is now 0, this condition no longer holds true, and there is no break.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a[i]` is 0, `stop` is not explicitly set or remains False**.
