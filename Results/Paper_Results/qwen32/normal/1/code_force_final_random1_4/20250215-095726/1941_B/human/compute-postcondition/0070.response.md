The code assigns the value of `a[i]` to `opNum`. The condition related to `stop` and the loop breaking does not affect `opNum` directly. Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `opNum`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `opNum` is `a[i]`; If `a[i]` is less than 0, `stop` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
