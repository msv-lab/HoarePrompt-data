To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and how the output is generated based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Loop Iteration Processing**:
   - For each iteration, the loop reads a line from the input file (excluding the first line which contains `t`).
   - The line is split into two integers, `n` and `k`.
   - Depending on the value of `k` relative to `n`, the program prints a specific value:
     - If `k <= 4 * n - 4`, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
     - If `k == 4 * n - 3`, it prints `2 * n - 1`.
     - If `k == 4 * n - 2`, it prints `2 * n`.

2. **Final Output State**:
   - After processing all `t` test cases, the loop will have printed the result for each test case.
   - The variables `n` and `k` will hold the values from the last processed test case.
   - The variable `t` will still hold its initial value, as it is not modified within the loop.

Given the format requirement, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **After processing all `t` test cases, the loop will have printed the results for each test case. The variables `n` and `k` will hold the values from the last test case, and `t` will remain unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the final state means that the loop has gone through all the test cases, printed the appropriate results for each, and the variables `n` and `k` reflect the values from the last test case, while `t` retains its initial value.
