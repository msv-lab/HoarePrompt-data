The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means that the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the new input. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `_` is 2.**
