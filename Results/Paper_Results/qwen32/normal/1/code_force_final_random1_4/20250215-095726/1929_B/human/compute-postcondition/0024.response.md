To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This variable represents the number of test cases, but it does not directly influence the current print statement.
- `s` is the next line from the input file after the current `s`. This line is expected to contain two integers separated by a space.
- `n` is the first integer from the split string of the new `s`.
- `k` is the second integer from the split string of the new `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 * n - 1)
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement calculates the expression `2 * n - 1` and prints the result. Here, `n` is the first integer obtained from splitting the line `s` from the input file.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, we can only express the output in terms of `n`.

### Calculation:
- The expression `2 * n - 1` means that we take the integer `n`, multiply it by 2, and then subtract 1.

### Final Output Description:
The code will print the result of the expression `2 * n - 1`, where `n` is the first integer from the split string of the new `s`.

Output: **2 * n - 1 (where n is the first integer from the split string of the new s)**
