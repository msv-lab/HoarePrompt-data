The code snippet `n, k = map(int, s.split())` splits the string `s` into parts, converts those parts into integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k`. Given that `s` is the next line from the input file and contains two integers separated by whitespace, `n` will take the value of the first integer and `k` will take the value of the second integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the next line from the input file (after the current `s`), `n` is the first integer from the split string of the new `s`, and `k` is the second integer from the split string of the new `s`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `n` is now the first integer from the split string of the new `s`, and the value of `k` is now the second integer from the split string of the new `s`. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged.
