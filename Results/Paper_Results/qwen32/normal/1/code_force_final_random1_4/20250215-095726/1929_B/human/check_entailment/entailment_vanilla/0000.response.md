Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We need to color the minimum number of cells in an `n x n` grid such that at least `k` diagonals contain at least one colored cell. There are `4n - 2` diagonals in total in an `n x n` grid.

- **Main Diagonals**: There are `n` main diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right.
- **Anti-Diagonals**: There are `n` anti-diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left.
- **Additional Diagonals**: There are `2(n-1)` additional diagonals that do not pass through the center of the grid.

The goal is to find the minimum number of cells to color such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.

### Key Observations

1. **Minimum Coloring Strategy**:
   - To minimize the number of colored cells, we should aim to cover as many diagonals as possible with each colored cell.
   - A single cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).
   
2. **Special Case**:
   - If `k == 4n - 2`, it means we need to cover all diagonals. In this case, we need to color `(k // 2) + 1` cells because the last diagonal will require an additional cell to ensure it's covered.

3. **General Case**:
   - For any other `k`, we can cover `k` diagonals with `ceil(k / 2)` cells. This is because each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals, and we need to round up to ensure all `k` diagonals are covered.

### Provided Solution Analysis

The provided solution correctly implements the above strategy:

```python
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
```

- **Special Case Handling**: When `k == 4n - 2`, the solution prints `(k // 2) + 1`, which is correct as explained.
- **General Case Handling**: For all other values of `k`, the solution prints `ceil(k / 2)`, which ensures that we cover at least `k` diagonals with the minimum number of cells.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly handles both the special case where all diagonals need to be covered and the general case where fewer than all diagonals need to be covered. Therefore, the solution is correct.

**Correctness: True**
