Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. The final state of the program is that it has printed the results for all test cases, with `n` and `k` holding the values from the last test case processed.**
