To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

- `a` is an integer representing the number of rows (N) in the field such that 3 ≤ N ≤ 99 and N is odd.
- `b` is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field such that 3 ≤ M ≤ 99 and M is odd.
- `dx` is an integer equal to `b`.
- `dy` is an integer equal to `b`.

The code snippet is:
```python
return x + dx, y + dy
```

Here, `x` and `y` are not defined in the initial state, but we know that `dx` and `dy` both equal `b`. Therefore, the function returns `(x + b, y + b)`.

Since `x` and `y` are not specified, we cannot determine their exact values, but we can express the output in terms of `x`, `y`, and `b`.

Output State: **The program returns `(x + b, y + b)`, where `b` is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field such that 3 ≤ M ≤ 99 and M is odd.**
