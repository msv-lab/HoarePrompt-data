#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of rows (N) in the field such that 3 ≤ N ≤ 99 and N is odd; b is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field such that 3 ≤ M ≤ 99 and M is odd.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns `(x + b, y + b)`, where `b` is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field such that 3 ≤ M ≤ 99 and M is odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two parameters, `a` and `b`. It extracts `x` and `y` from `a` and `dx` and `dy` from `b`, then returns a tuple `(x + dx, y + dy)`.
