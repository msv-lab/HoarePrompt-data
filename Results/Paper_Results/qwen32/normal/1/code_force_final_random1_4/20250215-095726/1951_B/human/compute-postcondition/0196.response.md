Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of distinct integers and `k` is another integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n. It also receives a list of `n` distinct integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
