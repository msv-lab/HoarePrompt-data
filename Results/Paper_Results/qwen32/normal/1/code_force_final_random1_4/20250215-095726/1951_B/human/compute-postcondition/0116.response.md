Postcondition: **`s` is a list with at least one element, `j` is `len(s) - 2`, `p` is `len(s) - 2`, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `ans` is `len(s) - 1`, `h` is equal to `s[0]`, `i` is the element at position `len(s) - 1` in the list `s`. If `z` is 1, `ans1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged.**
