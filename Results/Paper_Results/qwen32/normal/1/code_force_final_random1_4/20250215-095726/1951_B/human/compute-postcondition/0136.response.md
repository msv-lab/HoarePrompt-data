Output State: **`s` is a list of integers from the input with the first element swapped with the element at index `k-1`; `j` is -1; `p` is `len(s) - 2`; `ans1` is the count of elements equal to `h` (with `s[0] != h` condition met) plus elements less than or equal to `h` after the first match; `z` is 1 if any element equal to `h` was found; `n` and `k` are the values from the input; `t` is unchanged; `ans` is 0; `h` is `s[0]`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` has been changed to -1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
