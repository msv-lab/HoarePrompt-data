### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic and correctness of the provided code step-by-step.

#### Overview:
The goal is to determine the maximum number of wins the cow at index `k` can achieve by either doing nothing or making one strategic swap with another cow before the tournament starts.

#### Key Points:
1. **Initial Setup**: The function `func_1` is called with the list `a` which contains the ratings of the cows.
2. **Identifying Higher Ratings**: The function iterates through the list to find the indices of cows with higher ratings than the cow at index `k`.
3. **Decision Making**:
   - If no cow has a higher rating, the cow at index `k` can win all matches (`n-1`).
   - If one cow has a higher rating, the function calculates the maximum wins based on the position of that cow.
   - If more than one cow has a higher rating, the function calculates the maximum wins considering the positions of the two highest-rated cows.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Undefined Variable `n`**: Inside `func_1`, the variable `n` is used but not defined within the scope of the function. This should be passed as an argument to the function.
2. **Incorrect Logic for Multiple Higher Ratings**: The current logic does not correctly handle the scenario where there are multiple cows with higher ratings. Specifically, the conditions and calculations for determining the maximum wins are flawed.
3. **Redundant Print Statement**: There is a print statement inside the function that prints `ind` when `k` equals 14. This is unnecessary and can be removed.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Pass `n` and `k` as arguments to `func_1`.
- Correctly calculate the maximum wins based on the positions of cows with higher ratings.
- Ensure that the logic handles all edge cases properly.

Given the current implementation, the logic for calculating the maximum wins is flawed, especially for the case when there are multiple cows with higher ratings.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.

**Correctness: False**
