#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two parts: the first part is a list with two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of cows and your cow's index, respectively. The second part is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, where all a_i are pairwise different. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            ind.append(i)
            c += 1
        
        if c == 2:
            break
        
    #State: 
    if (k == 14) :
        print(ind)
        #This is printed: ind (where ind is an undefined variable)
    #State: `k` is an integer. If `k` is equal to 14, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not evaluated further as there is no else part.
    if (ind == []) :
        return n - 1
        #The program returns 13
    #State: `k` is an integer, and `ind` is not an empty list
    if (len(ind) == 1) :
        if (ind[0] == 0) :
            return k - 1
            #The program returns k - 1, where k is an integer.

            return ind[0] - 1
            #The program returns the value of the single element in list `ind` minus 1, which is greater than `k` minus 1.
        #State: `k` is an integer, and `ind` is a non-empty list with exactly one element. The element of `ind` is not equal to 0 and is less than or equal to `k`.
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
        #The program returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`. Given that `ind[0]` is not equal to 0 and is less than or equal to `k`, the returned value is `k - ind[0]` unless `ind[0]` is 1, in which case the returned value is 0.
    #State: `k` is an integer, and `ind` is not an empty list with a length greater than 1
    if (ind[0] == 0) :
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
        #The program returns the minimum value between the second element of `ind` minus 1 and `k` minus 1.
    #State: `k` is an integer, and `ind` is not an empty list with a length greater than 1. The first element of `ind` is not 0.
    if (k > ind[1]) :
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
        #The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`. Given that `ind[0]` is not 0 and `k` (which is greater than `ind[1]`) is irrelevant to the calculation, the return value depends on the specific values of `ind[0]` and `ind[1]`.
    #State: `k` is an integer, and `ind` is not an empty list with a length greater than 1. The first element of `ind` is not 0. Additionally, `k` is less than or equal to the second element of `ind`.
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])
    #The program returns the maximum of (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `a` as input, which contains test cases. Each test case includes two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` unique integers representing cow ratings. The function determines and returns an integer based on the ratings relative to the cow at index `k`. The return value can be `n - 1`, `k - 1`, or a calculated value based on the indices of cows with higher ratings compared to the cow at index `k`.
