Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `s` is a list of integers where the element at index `p` and the element at index `k-1` have been swapped; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`; `h` is the first element of the list `s`; `j` is `len(s) - 2` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise the index of the last element checked minus one; `p` is equal to `j`; `ans1` is 0; `z` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a list of integers with at least one element. If `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, and `z` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, and `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the next element in `s`. If `i` equals `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i` does not equal `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h` and `i` does not equal `h`, `z` is set to 1. If `z` equals 1 and `i` does not equal `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `s`. If `i == h`, and `z` equals 1, `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i != h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`. If `i > h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `z` is 1 if `i != h`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
