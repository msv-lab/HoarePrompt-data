Postcondition: **`s` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `s`. If `i == h`, and `z` equals 1, `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i != h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`. If `i > h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `z` is 1 if `i != h`.**
