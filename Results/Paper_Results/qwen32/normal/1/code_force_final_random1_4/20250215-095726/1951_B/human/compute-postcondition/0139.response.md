Postcondition: **`s` is a list of integers from the input with the first element swapped with the element at index `k-1` and must have at least two elements, `j` is 0, `p` is `len(s) - 2`, `ans1` is the count of elements equal to `h` (with `s[0] != h` condition met) plus elements less than or equal to `h` after the first match, `z` is 1 if any element equal to `h` was found, `n` and `k` are the values from the input, `t` is unchanged, `ans` is 0, `h` is `s[0]`, and `i` is an element in `s` such that `h < i`.**
