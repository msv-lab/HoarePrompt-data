Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the problem described. Specifically, the logic for determining the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is flawed. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Visible Fireworks:**
   - The program calculates `mn` as `min(a, b) + m`, which is not necessarily the optimal time to check for the maximum number of overlapping fireworks.
   - It then checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and adds an extra `1` if true, but this condition is not sufficient to determine the correct maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

2. **Lack of Proper Overlap Calculation:**
   - The program does not properly account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations over time. It simply sums up the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the `mn` time frame without considering their visibility periods.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled:**
   - The program fails to consider scenarios where the visibility periods of fireworks from different installations overlap in complex ways.
   - It also does not handle cases where `a` or `b` is `1`, which means fireworks are launched every minute.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the number of fireworks visible at each minute and find the maximum overlap. This involves iterating through the time periods and counting the number of fireworks visible at each minute, which can be efficiently done using a sweep line algorithm or similar approach.

Here's a corrected version of the program that handles these issues:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b
        def lcm(x, y):
            from math import gcd
            return x * y // gcd(x, y)
        
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        
        # Find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time
        max_fireworks = 0
        for t in range(lcm_ab):
            count = 0
            if t % a <= m:
                count += m // a + 1
            if t % b <= m:
                count += m // b + 1
            if t % a <= m and t % b <= m and t % lcm_ab <= m:
                count -= 1  # Subtract the double-counted firework
            max_fireworks = max(max_fireworks, count)
        
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the period over which we need to check for overlaps. It then iterates through each minute within this period, counts the number of fireworks visible, and keeps track of the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. This ensures that all potential cases are handled correctly.
