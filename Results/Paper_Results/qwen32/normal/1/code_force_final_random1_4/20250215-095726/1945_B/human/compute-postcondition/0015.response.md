Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `mn` is `min(a, b) + m`. Regardless of whether `m % a == 0` and `m % b == 0` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `mn` remain unchanged.**
