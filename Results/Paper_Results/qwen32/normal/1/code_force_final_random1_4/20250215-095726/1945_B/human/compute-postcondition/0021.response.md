Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `i` is `i + 1`; `a`, `b`, and `m` are the new integers read from the input; `mn` is `min(a, b) + m`. Regardless of whether `m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)` is true or false, the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `mn` remain as described.**
