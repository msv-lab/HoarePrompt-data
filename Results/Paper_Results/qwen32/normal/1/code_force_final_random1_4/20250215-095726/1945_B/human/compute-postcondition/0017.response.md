The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. This means the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` will be updated based on the new input, while the values of `t`, `i`, and `mn` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input
- `mn` is `min(a, b) + m`

After executing the code snippet `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())`, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` will be updated to the new integers provided in the input. The values of `t`, `i`, and `mn` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `i` is `i + 1`; `a`, `b`, and `m` are the new integers read from the input; `mn` is `min(a, b) + m` (using the old values of `a`, `b`, and `m`).**
