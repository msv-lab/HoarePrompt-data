To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head. The loop continues as long as `pos` is not equal to the length of `sorted_indices`.

Given:
- `pos = 2`
- `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`

The length of `sorted_indices` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `pos` must be less than 3. Since `pos` is currently 2, it satisfies this condition, and no adjustment is necessary to `pos` or `sorted_indices` to ensure the loop can execute again.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged for the loop to proceed.

State: **`a = [0, 0, 2], x = [-2, 1, -3], k = 10, n = 3, sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2], distance = 1, pos = 2, rest = 0.`**
