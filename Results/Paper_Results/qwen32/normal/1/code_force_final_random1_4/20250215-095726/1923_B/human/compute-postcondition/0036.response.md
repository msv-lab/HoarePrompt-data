The code snippet `rest -= delta` subtracts the value of `delta` from `rest`. Given that `rest` is initially 10 and `delta` is 2, `rest` will be updated to 8.

Output State: **`a = [0, 0, 2]`, `x = [-2, 1, -3]`, `k = 10`, `n = 3`, `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`, `distance = 1`, `pos = 2`, `rest = 8`, `delta = 2`**. 

This means that all variables remain the same except for `rest`, which has been decreased by 2 from its initial value of 10 to a new value of 8.
