Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta` if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was not 0. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, then `a[sorted_indices[pos - 1]]` is reduced by `delta` instead. `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of `n` monsters, `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second, `n` is the length of the list `a` and is greater than 0, `sorted_indices` is a list of indices sorted by the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `pos` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the initial value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` and the subsequent reduction, and `rest` is `k - 2 * delta`. `delta` is `min(k - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])` if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was not 0, otherwise `delta` is `min(k - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos - 1]])`.**
