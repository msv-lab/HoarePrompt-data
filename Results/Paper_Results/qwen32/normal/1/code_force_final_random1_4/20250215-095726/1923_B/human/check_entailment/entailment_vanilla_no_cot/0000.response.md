Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Sorting**: The function sorts the indices of the monsters based on their absolute distance from the player (`abs(x[i])`). This ensures that we consider the closest monsters first.
- **Looping through Monsters**: It then iterates through these sorted indices, checking if any monster has reached the player (`abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`). If a monster reaches the player, it returns `False`.
- **Shooting Bullets**: For each distance, it attempts to shoot up to `k` bullets at the monsters at that distance. It reduces the health of the monsters accordingly and moves to the next monster if its health drops to zero.
- **Distance Increment**: After processing all monsters at the current distance, it increments the distance and repeats the process until all monsters are either dead or have been considered.

### Potential Issues:
- **Handling of Multiple Monsters at Same Distance**: The logic seems to handle multiple monsters at the same distance correctly by iterating through them and shooting up to `k` bullets per iteration.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as when there are no monsters, or when all monsters are already dead.
- **Performance**: The sorting step is `O(n log n)`, and the subsequent loop is `O(n)`, which should be efficient enough given the constraints (`n` up to `3 * 10^5`).

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`.
- **Output**: It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the result.

### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. It handles the sorting of monsters by their distance, shoots bullets efficiently, and checks whether any monster reaches the player.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
