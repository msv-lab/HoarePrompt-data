To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means that the loop will continue as long as both `rest` is not equal to 0 and `pos` is not equal to the length of `sorted_indices`.

Given the current state:
- `rest = 10`
- `pos = 1`
- `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`

Let's analyze the conditions:
1. `rest != 0`: This condition is already satisfied because `rest` is 10.
2. `pos != len(sorted_indices)`: The length of `sorted_indices` is 3. Since `pos` is 1, this condition is also satisfied.

Since both conditions are already satisfied, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, we can repeat the program state as it is at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`a = [0, 0, 0]`, `x = [-2, 1, -3]`, `k = 10`, `n = 3`, `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`, `distance = 2`, `pos = 1`, `rest = 10`, `delta = 0`**
