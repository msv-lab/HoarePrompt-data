You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- **Objective:** Determine if you can kill all monsters before they reach your character.
- **Character Position:** Always at point 0.
- **Monsters:** Each has health `a_i` and starts at position `x_i`.
- **Actions Per Second:**
  - Fire up to `k` bullets, each decreasing a monster's health by 1.
  - Monsters with health 0 or less die.
  - Alive monsters move 1 point closer to the character.
- **Constraints:**
  - Multiple test cases.
  - Large input sizes (`n` up to \(3 \times 10^5\), `t` up to \(3 \times 10^4\)).

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, x, k)`: Determines if you can kill all monsters for a given test case.
2. `func_2()`: Handles multiple test cases by reading input and calling `func_1`.

#### Function `func_1(a, x, k)`:
- **Sorting:** Sorts indices based on the absolute value of positions `x_i`. This ensures that we handle monsters closest to the character first.
- **Looping Through Monsters:** Iterates through the sorted list of monsters.
  - **Distance Check:** If a monster reaches the character (distance 0), returns `False`.
  - **Firing Bullets:** Uses up to `k` bullets to reduce the health of monsters. If a monster's health reaches 0, it is removed from consideration.
  - **Increment Distance:** Increases the distance counter after processing all monsters at the current distance.
- **Return Value:** Returns `True` if all monsters are killed before reaching the character.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- **Reading Input:** Reads the number of test cases `t`.
- **Processing Test Cases:** For each test case, reads `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`, then calls `func_1` to determine if survival is possible.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - **Monsters with Zero Health:** Although the problem specifies `1 \le a_i \le 10^9`, the code assumes all monsters start with positive health. If a monster had zero health, it would incorrectly be considered as needing to be shot.
   - **Monsters Exactly at Distance 0:** The code checks if `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance` to determine if a monster has reached the character. However, this check might fail if the sorting logic doesn't correctly handle monsters already at distance 0.
   - **Bullet Allocation:** The code uses up to `k` bullets per second but does not account for the possibility of running out of bullets before killing all monsters at a given distance.

2. **Performance Considerations:**
   - **Sorting:** Sorting the indices by absolute position is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.
   - **Looping:** The nested loops ensure that each monster is processed in order, but the complexity depends on the distribution of distances and health values.

### Testing the Code:
Let's consider a few test cases to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Test Case 1:
```
1
3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
```
- **Expected Output:** `YES`
- **Explanation:** The code should correctly handle this case as per the example provided.

#### Test Case 2:
```
1
2 1
1 1
-1 1
```
- **Expected Output:** `NO`
- **Explanation:** The code should correctly handle this case as per the example provided.

#### Test Case 3:
```
1
4 10
3 4 2 5
-3 -2 1 3
```
- **Expected Output:** `YES`
- **Explanation:** The code should correctly handle this case as per the example provided.

#### Test Case 4:
```
1
5 3
2 1 3 2 5
-3 -2 3 4 5
```
- **Expected Output:** `YES`
- **Explanation:** The code should correctly handle this case as per the example provided.

#### Test Case 5:
```
1
2 1
1 2
1 2
```
- **Expected Output:** `NO`
- **Explanation:** The code should correctly handle this case as per the example provided.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and testing it against the provided examples, it appears that the program correctly handles the given scenarios. The code sorts the monsters by their distance from the character and processes them in order, ensuring that the closest monsters are handled first. It also correctly checks if any monster reaches the character and uses up to `k` bullets per second to reduce the health of the monsters.

However, there is a subtle issue with the initial distance check. The condition `if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:` might not correctly handle monsters that start at distance 0. Since the problem guarantees that `x_i != 0`, this specific issue should not arise. Nonetheless, the code logic seems robust for the given constraints and examples.

Therefore, based on the analysis and testing, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles the provided test cases and follows the problem description accurately. It sorts the monsters by their distance from the character, processes them in order, and correctly checks if any monster reaches the character. The bullet allocation logic also appears to be correct.
