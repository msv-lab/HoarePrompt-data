The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The variables `a`, `x`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster, `k` is the integer read from the input representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second, `n` is the integer read from the input, and `t` must be greater than 0.**
