The code `a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta` modifies the list `a` by subtracting the value of `delta` from the element at the index specified by `sorted_indices[pos]`.

Given:
- `a = [0, 0, 2]`
- `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`
- `pos = 2`
- `delta = 2`

The index to modify in `a` is `sorted_indices[pos]`, which is `sorted_indices[2]` and equals `2`. Therefore, `a[2]` is modified by subtracting `delta` (which is `2`).

So, `a[2]` changes from `2` to `2 - 2 = 0`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a = [0, 0, 0]`, `x = [-2, 1, -3]`, `k = 10`, `n = 3`, `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`, `distance = 1`, `pos = 2`, `rest = 8`, `delta = 2`**
