To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. Here's the breakdown:

- `a` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `x` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.

The code snippet contains a `print` statement that evaluates the result of `func_1(a, x, k)`. If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns a truthy value, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact behavior of `func_1(a, x, k)`. However, we can still describe the output in terms of the function's return value.

### Explanation:
- The output depends on the return value of `func_1(a, x, k)`.
- If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns a truthy value (e.g., `True`, a non-zero number, a non-empty list, etc.), the `print` statement will output 'YES'.
- If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns a falsy value (e.g., `False`, 0, an empty list, etc.), the `print` statement will output 'NO'.

Given this information, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **'YES' if func_1(a, x, k) returns a truthy value, otherwise 'NO'**
