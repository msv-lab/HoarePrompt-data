Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster, `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second, and `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `k` is the integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second, `n` is the integer read from the input, and `t` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is the new list of integers read from the input; `x` is a new list of integers read from the input; `k` is the second integer read from the input; `n` is the first integer read from the input; `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is the new list of integers read from the input; `x` is the newly read list of integers from the input; `k` is the second integer read from the input; `n` is the first integer read from the input; `t` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
