To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute its first iteration, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head: `rest != 0` and `pos != len(sorted_indices)`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `rest != 0`**
   - The current value of `rest` is 10, which satisfies `rest != 0`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `rest`.

2. **Condition 2: `pos != len(sorted_indices)`**
   - The current value of `pos` is 2.
   - The length of `sorted_indices` is 3 (`len(sorted_indices) == 3`).
   - Since `pos` (which is 2) is not equal to `len(sorted_indices)` (which is 3), this condition is also satisfied.

### Conclusion:
Since both conditions `rest != 0` and `pos != len(sorted_indices)` are already satisfied with the given state, no modifications are required to allow the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed.

### Final State:
State: **`a = [0, 0, 2]`, `x = [-2, 1, -3]`, `k = 10`, `n = 3`, `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`, `distance = 1`, `pos = 2`, `rest = 10`**
