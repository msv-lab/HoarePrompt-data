The code `rest -= delta` subtracts the value of `delta` from `rest`. Given that `delta` is 0, `rest` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a = [0, 0, 0]`, `x = [-2, 1, -3]`, `k = 10`, `n = 3`, `sorted_indices = [1, 0, 2]`, `distance = 1`, `rest = 8`, `delta = 0`, `pos = 2`**

In natural language: The value of `rest` remains 8 because `delta` is 0, and no other variables are affected.
