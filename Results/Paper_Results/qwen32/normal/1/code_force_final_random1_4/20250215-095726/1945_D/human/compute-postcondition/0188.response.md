Given the code snippet `custo += a_values[y]`, we need to add the value of `a_values[y]` to the current value of `custo`. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `custo` is 120.
- `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].

The value of `y` is not specified, but we know that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]`. This condition does not affect the direct calculation of `custo` but helps us infer the possible value of `y`.

Since `a_values` has 5 elements (indices 0 to 4), `y` must be between 1 and 4 (inclusive) to ensure `y - 1` is a valid index.

Let's consider the possible values of `y`:
- If `y` is 1, `a_values[y]` is 20.
- If `y` is 2, `a_values[y]` is 30.
- If `y` is 3, `a_values[y]` is 40.
- If `y` is 4, `a_values[y]` is 50.

However, without the exact value of `y`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `custo`. But we can express the new value of `custo` in terms of `y`.

New value of `custo` = 120 + `a_values[y]`.

Thus, the Output State can be expressed as:

Output State: **`custo` is 120 + `a_values[y]`; `custos` is [50, 90, 120]; `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`; `x` remains unchanged; `num_fila` is 5; `max_p` is 2; `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]; `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 55]; `nf` is a list of substrings from the input; `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input; `b` is a list of substrings from the new input. Additionally, `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]`.**
