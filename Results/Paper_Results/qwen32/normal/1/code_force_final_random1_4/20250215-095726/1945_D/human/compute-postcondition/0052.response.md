The code snippet provided decrements the value of `na_frente` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `c` is 1; `na_frente` is the first integer read from the input minus 1; `pos_final` is the second integer read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input; `total` is the cumulative cost of the cheapest path from `na_frente` to 0; `best` is the minimum cost encountered during the loop where `v` was less than or equal to `pos_final`.**
