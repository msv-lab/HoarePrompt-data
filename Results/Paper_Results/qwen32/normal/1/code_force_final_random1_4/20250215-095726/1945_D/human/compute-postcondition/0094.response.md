To determine what will be printed by the `print(best)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

- `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `cases`: An integer read from input, which must be greater than 0.
- `n` and `m`: Integers where `1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000`, representing sizes of lists `a` and `b`.
- `a` and `b`: Lists of integers with lengths `n` and `m` respectively, where each element in these lists satisfies `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9`.
- `c`: An integer set to 1.
- `na_frente`: The first integer read from the input minus 1.
- `pos_final`: The second integer read from the input minus 2.
- `custo_pra_trocar_a`: A list of integers read from the input.
- `custo_pra_passar_b`: A list of integers read from the input.
- `total`: The accumulated cost from `na_frente` to `0` using the smallest possible costs from `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.
- `best`: The minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` encountered when `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.

Given this context, `best` is determined by iterating through indices up to `pos_final` and calculating the minimum cost of accumulating `total` plus the cost of changing to `a` at each index `v`.

The `print(best)` statement will output the minimum cost found during this process.

Output: **best (where best is the minimum value of total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] for v ≤ pos_final)**
