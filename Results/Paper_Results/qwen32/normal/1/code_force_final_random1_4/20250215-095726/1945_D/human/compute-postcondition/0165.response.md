To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the given `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head is defined as:

```python
for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
```

From this, we identify the variables involved in the loop head as:
- `y`: The loop variable.
- `num_fila`: The upper bound of the range (exclusive).
- `max_p`: The lower bound of the range (exclusive).
- The step value `-1` indicates that the loop decrements `y`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `num_fila - 1 > max_p - 1` must be true. This simplifies to `num_fila > max_p`.

Let's analyze the provided state and determine what needs to be adjusted:

State before the loop starts:
- `custo` is 0.
- `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition.
- `i` is `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`.
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`.
- `max_p` is `int(nf[1])`.
- `a_values` is `[int(y1), int(y2), ..., int(yn)]` where `y1, y2, ..., yn` are the elements of `a`.
- `b_values` is a list containing all integer values from `b`.
- `nf` is a list of substrings from the input.
- `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input.
- `b` is a list of substrings from the new input.

Given the loop head, the only variables we can adjust are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`. However, since `y` is the loop variable and its initial value is determined by `num_fila` and `max_p`, we need to ensure that `num_fila > max_p` for the loop to execute.

Thus, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`.

State: **`custo` is 0, `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition, `i` is `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` must be greater than `max_p`, `a_values` is `[int(y1), int(y2), ..., int(yn)]` where `y1, y2, ..., yn` are the elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integer values from `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input**.
