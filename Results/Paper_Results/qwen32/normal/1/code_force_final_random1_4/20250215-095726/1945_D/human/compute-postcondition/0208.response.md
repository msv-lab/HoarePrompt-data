The code appends the value of `custo` to the list `custos`. Given that `custo` is 140, this value is added to the end of the list `custos`.

Output State: **`custo` is 140, `custos` is [50, 90, 120, 140], `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 55], `nf` remains a list of substrings from the input, `a` remains a list of substrings obtained from the new input, `b` remains a list of substrings from the new input.**

In natural language: The value of `custo` (which is 140) has been appended to the list `custos`, making `custos` now equal to [50, 90, 120, 140]. All other variables remain unchanged.
