The code snippet `b_values.append(int(y))` appends the integer value of `y` to the list `b_values`. This means that `b_values` will now contain one more element, which is the integer representation of `y`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `b_values`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`custo` is 0, `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition, `i` is `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is `int(nf[1])`, `a_values` is `[int(y1), int(y2), ..., int(yn)]` where `y1, y2, ..., yn` are the elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the previous elements plus `int(y)`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input that must have at least one element**.
