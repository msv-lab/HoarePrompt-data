To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `y`.

Given the loop:
```python
for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the variable `y` starting from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p`.
- The step is `-1`, meaning `y` decreases by 1 in each iteration.

### Current State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was some value such that the loop condition was satisfied.
- Since the loop decrements `y` by 1 each time, the value of `y` at the start of the next iteration should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

### Adjusting the State:
- The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `y`.
- Given that `y` is decremented by 1, we subtract 1 from its current value.

### Example Adjustment:
If `y` was `num_fila - 1` at the start of the previous iteration, then at the end of that iteration, `y` would have been decremented to `num_fila - 2`.
Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `y` should be `num_fila - 2`.

### Final State:
Since we do not know the exact value of `y` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `y` should be decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`custo` is either `custo + a_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, or `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is greater than or equal to `b_values[y]`. `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition. `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `a_values` is `[int(y1), int(y2), ..., int(yn)]` where `y1, y2, ..., yn` are the elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing all integer values from `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input, and `b` is a list of substrings from the new input. `y` is `y - 1`**
