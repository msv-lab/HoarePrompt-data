Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `c` is 0; `na_frente` is at least 1; `pos_final` is an integer read from input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input; `v` is `na_frente - 3`; `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. If `best` was previously greater than the new `total`, `best` is updated to this new `total` value. All other variables retain their initial values.
