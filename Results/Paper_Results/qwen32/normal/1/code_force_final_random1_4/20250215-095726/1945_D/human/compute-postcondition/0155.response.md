The only object in the loop head is the variable `y`, which is being iterated over the list `a`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `y` to the next element in the list `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `custo` is 0
- `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition
- `i` is `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`
- `x` remains unchanged
- `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`
- `max_p` is `int(nf[1])`
- `a_values` is `[int(y), int(y)]`
- `b_values` is an empty list
- `nf` is a list of substrings from the input
- `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input
- `b` is a list of substrings from the new input
- `y` is the next element in the list `a`

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was the current element being processed from the list `a`. For the next iteration, `y` should be the subsequent element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`custo` is 0, `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition, `i` is `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is `int(nf[1])`, `a_values` is `[int(y), int(y)]`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, `y` is the next element in the list `a` after the current `y`**
