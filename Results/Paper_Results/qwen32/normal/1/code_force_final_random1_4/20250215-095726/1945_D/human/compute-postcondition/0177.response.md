The code snippet `custo += b_values[y]` updates the value of `custo` by adding `b_values[y]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`custo` is updated to `custo + b_values[y]`; `custos` contains all intermediate values of `custo` after each addition; `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`; `x` remains unchanged; `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`; `a_values` is `[int(y1), int(y2), ..., int(yn)]` where `y1, y2, ..., yn` are the elements of `a`; `b_values` is a list containing all integer values from `b`; `nf` is a list of substrings from the input; `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input; `b` is a list of substrings from the new input; `y` is `y`.**
