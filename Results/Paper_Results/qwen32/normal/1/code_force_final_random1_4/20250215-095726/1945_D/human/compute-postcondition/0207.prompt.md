Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `custo` is 120, `custos` is [50, 90, 120], `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `a_values` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], `b_values` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 55], `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input, and `b` is a list of substrings from the new input.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
        custo += b_values[y]
        if y == 1:
            custo += a_values[0]
            break
    else:
        custo += a_values[y]
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `custo` is either `120 + b_values[y]` if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, or `120 + a_values[y]` if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]`. `custos` remains `[50, 90, 120]`. `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`. `x` remains unchanged. `num_fila` remains 5. `max_p` remains 2. `a_values` remains `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`. `b_values` remains `[15, 25, 35, 45, 55]`. `nf` remains a list of substrings from the input. `a` remains a list of substrings obtained from the new input. `b` remains a list of substrings from the new input`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of in both cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `custo` is 175 if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` (which evaluates to `20 + 25 <= 20` being false, thus making `custo` 160). `custos` remains `[50, 90, 120]`, `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` remains 5, `max_p` remains 2, `a_values` remains `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, `b_values` remains `[15, 25, 35, 45, 55]`, `nf` remains a list of substrings from the input, `a` remains a list of substrings obtained from the new input, `b` remains a list of substrings from the new input`, and `y` remains 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement in both cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `custo` is either 195 or 190, depending on whether the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is true or false. `custos` remains `[50, 90, 120]`, `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` remains 5, `max_p` remains 2, `a_values` remains `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, `b_values` remains `[15, 25, 35, 45, 55]`, `nf` remains a list of substrings from the input, `a` remains a list of substrings obtained from the new input, `b` remains a list of substrings from the new input`, and `y` remains 2. If the condition is true, the program does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
