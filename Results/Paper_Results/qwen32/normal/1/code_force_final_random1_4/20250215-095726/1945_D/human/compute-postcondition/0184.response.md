The code snippet `custo += a_values[0]` adds the value of `a_values[0]` to the current value of `custo`. Given that `a_values[0]` is 10 and `custo` is initially `120 + b_values[1]`, we first need to compute the initial value of `custo`.

Since `b_values[1]` is 25, the initial value of `custo` is `120 + 25 = 145`. Adding `a_values[0]` (which is 10) to this initial value results in `145 + 10 = 155`.

Therefore, the updated value of `custo` is 155. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y` is 1, `custo` is 155, `custos` is `[50, 90, 120]`, `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is 5, `max_p` is 2, `a_values` is `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, `b_values` is `[15, 25, 35, 45, 55]`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input, and `b` is a list of substrings from the new input. Additionally, `a_values[0] + b_values[1]` is less than or equal to `a_values[1]`.**
