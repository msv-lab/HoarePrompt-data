The given code snippet reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `custo_pra_trocar_a`. This means that the previous definition of `custo_pra_trocar_a` as a list of integers read from input is now updated with the actual input values.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `cases` remains an integer read from input and must be greater than 0.
- `n` and `m` remain integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
- `a` remains a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `b` remains a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
- `c` remains 1.
- `na_frente` remains the first integer read from the input.
- `pos_final` remains the second integer read from the input minus 1.
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` is now a list of integers read from the input.
- `custo_pra_passar_b` remains a list of integers read from input.
- `total` remains the cumulative cost of the cheapest path from `na_frente` to 0.
- `best` remains the minimum cost encountered during the loop where `v` was less than or equal to `pos_final`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `c` is 1; `na_frente` is the first integer read from the input; `pos_final` is the second integer read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input; `total` is the cumulative cost of the cheapest path from `na_frente` to 0; `best` is the minimum cost encountered during the loop where `v` was less than or equal to `pos_final`.**
