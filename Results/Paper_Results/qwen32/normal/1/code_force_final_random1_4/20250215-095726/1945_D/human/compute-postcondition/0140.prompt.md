Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `c` is 2; `na_frente` is the first integer read from the input minus 1; `pos_final` is the second integer read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input; `total` is 0; `best` is 10
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `c` is 2; `na_frente` is the first integer read from the input minus 1 and must be at least 0; `pos_final` is the second integer read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than the current value of `best`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is updated similarly based on the comparison between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `c` is 2; `na_frente` is the first integer read from the input minus 1 and must be at least 0; `pos_final` is the second integer read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input; `v` is `na_frente` if this is the first iteration, otherwise `v - 1`. If `v <= pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `total` is now `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `v > pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; `c` is 2; `na_frente` is the first integer read from the input minus 1 and must be at least 0; `pos_final` is the second integer read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input; `v` is `v - 1`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. Additionally, if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. In this case, `best` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
