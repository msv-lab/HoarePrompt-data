Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `na_frente` and `pos_final`, and two lists of integers `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost to reach a specific position (`pos_final`) from the starting position (`na_frente`) by either swapping elements or passing through them based on the costs provided in the lists.**
