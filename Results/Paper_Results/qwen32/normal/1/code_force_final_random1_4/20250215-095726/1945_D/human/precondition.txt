t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each element in test_cases is a tuple containing three elements: (n, m, (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), (b_1, b_2, ..., b_n)), where n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
