Postcondition: **`custo` is either 195 or 190, depending on whether the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is true or false. `custos` remains `[50, 90, 120]`, `i` remains `i_end + (num_fila - max_p)`, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` remains 5, `max_p` remains 2, `a_values` remains `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, `b_values` remains `[15, 25, 35, 45, 55]`, `nf` remains a list of substrings from the input, `a` remains a list of substrings obtained from the new input, `b` remains a list of substrings from the new input`, and `y` remains 2. If the condition is true, the program does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
