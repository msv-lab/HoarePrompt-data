Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a new defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input, and if `y` is greater than `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`. If the difference between the (i+1)-th and i-th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the i-th and (i-1)-th elements of `l`, then `d1[3]` is 0 and `d1[4]` is 1. Otherwise, `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2]`.**
