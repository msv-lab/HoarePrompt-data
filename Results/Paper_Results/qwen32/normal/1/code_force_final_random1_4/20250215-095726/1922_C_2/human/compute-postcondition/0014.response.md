The given code modifies the defaultdict `d1` by setting the value at key `i + 2` to a calculated expression involving elements from the list `l` and the current value of `d1` at key `i + 1`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, and `d2` remain unchanged.

Specifically, `d1[i + 2]` is set to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an integer greater than 2
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory
- `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory

After executing the code, the new state is:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` remains 2
- `n` remains an integer greater than 2
- `l` remains a list of integers obtained from the input
- `d1` now has `d1[4]` set to `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`
- `d2` remains a defaultdict with int as the default factory

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory**
