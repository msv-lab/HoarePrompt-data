To determine the output of the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i`: Initialized to 0.
   - `n`: An integer greater than 2.
   - `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `d1`: A `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory.
   - `d2`: A `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. It is updated based on the loop's logic for keys from 1 to `n-1`.
   - `m`: Greater than or equal to 1.
   - `x` and `y`: Two integers obtained from the new input.
   - `j`: Initialized to 2.

2. **Understanding `d2`:**
   - `d2` is a dictionary where keys range from 1 to `n-1`.
   - The values of `d2` are updated in a loop, but the specific updates are not detailed in the initial state. Therefore, we can only say that `d2[i]` holds some integer value for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **The Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` calculates the difference between the values stored in `d2` at keys `y` and `x`.

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` because the specific updates to `d2` are not provided. However, we can describe the output in terms of these values.

**Output Description:**
The `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement will output the difference between the values stored in `d2` at keys `y` and `x`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] and d2[x] are the values in the defaultdict d2 at keys y and x respectively)**
