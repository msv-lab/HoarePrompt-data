Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input from the user, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a new defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input, and if `y` is greater than `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
        d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
    else:
        d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a new defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input, and if `y` is greater than `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`. If the difference between the (i+1)-th and i-th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the i-th and (i-1)-th elements of `l`, then `d1[3]` is 0 and `d1[4]` is 1. Otherwise, `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a new defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input, and if `y` is greater than `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`. If the difference between the (i+1)-th and i-th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the i-th and (i-1)-th elements of `l`, then `d1[3]` is 0, `d1[4]` is 1, and `d1[5]` is `1 + d1[4]`. Otherwise, `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2]` and `d1[5]` is `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a new defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input, and if `y` is greater than `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`. If the difference between the (i+1)-th and i-th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the i-th and (i-1)-th elements of `l`, then `d1[3]` is 0, `d1[4]` is 1, `d1[5]` is `1 + d1[4]`, and `d1[6]` is `1 + d1[5]`. Otherwise, `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2]`, `d1[5]` is `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`, and `d1[6]` is `l[5] - l[4] + d1[5]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
