The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
