The code snippet `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]` updates the value of `d2[i]`. Given the initial conditions, `d2[i]` was previously determined based on a comparison between differences in elements of the list `l`. However, this line of code overrides that previous assignment.

The new value of `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`.

Other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, and `d1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory where `d2[n - 1]` is 1, and `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`.**
