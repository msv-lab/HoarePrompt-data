Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory. Additionally, `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is less than `l[i] - l[i - 1]`.**
