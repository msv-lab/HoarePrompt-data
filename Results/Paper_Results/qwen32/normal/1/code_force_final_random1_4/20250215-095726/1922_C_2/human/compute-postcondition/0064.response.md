The given code snippet modifies the defaultdict `d1` by setting the value of `d1[i + 2]` to `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and `d1` initially contains `{2: 1}`.

Let's calculate the new value:
- `i + 1` is `2`, so `d1[2]` is `1`.
- `d1[i + 2]` is `d1[3]`, which is being set to `1 + d1[2]` or `1 + 1`, which equals `2`.

Therefore, `d1` will now contain `{2: 1, 3: 2}`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and contains {2: 1, 3: 2}, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory (and is now empty), `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m-1`, and `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input. Additionally, the difference between the (i+1)-th and i-th elements of `l` is less than the difference between the i-th and (i-1)-th elements of `l`.**
