Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and contains keys from 2 to n with values computed based on the differences between consecutive elements in `l`, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and contains the key `n-1` with the value 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m-1`, and `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers obtained from the input. Additionally, the difference between the `i+1`th and `i`th elements of `l` is less than or equal to the difference between the `i`th and `i-1`th elements of `l`.**
