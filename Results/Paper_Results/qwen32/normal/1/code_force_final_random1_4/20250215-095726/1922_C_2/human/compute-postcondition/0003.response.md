The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `d1` with `int` as the default factory, meaning that any key accessed in `d1` that does not exist will automatically be initialized to `0`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory.**
