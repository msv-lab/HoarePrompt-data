The given code snippet updates the value of `d1` at the key `i + 2`. Given that `i` is initially 2, the key `i + 2` evaluates to 4. The value at this key is set to `1 + d1[i + 1]`, which translates to `1 + d1[3]`.

Since `d1` is a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory, `d1[3]` will default to 0 if it hasn't been set before. Thus, `d1[4]` will be set to `1 + 0`, which is 1.

The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, and `d2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory where `d1[4]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory**.
