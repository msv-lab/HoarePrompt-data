The given code modifies the value of `d1[i + 2]` by setting it to `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `d1[i + 2]` becomes `d1[3]`, and `d1[i + 1]` is `d1[2]`.

Since `d1[2]` is initially 1, the new value of `d1[3]` will be `1 + 1`, which is 2.

No other variables are modified by the code snippet, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `d1[2]` is 1, `d1[3]` is 2, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory. Additionally, `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is less than `l[i] - l[i - 1]`.**
