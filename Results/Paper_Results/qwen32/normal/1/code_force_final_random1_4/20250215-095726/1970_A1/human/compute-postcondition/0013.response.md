The code snippet provided decrements the `balance` variable by 1. Given the initial state, the `balance` variable is part of the `BalanceInfo` object within the `balance_info` list. Since the exact value of `balance` is not specified, we can denote it as `balance - 1` after the operation.

The other variables (`s`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged by this operation. Specifically:
- `s` remains a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence.
- `n` remains the length of `s`.
- `i` remains `i + 1`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `balance_info` is a list containing two elements `BalanceInfo(balance - 1, i, s[i])`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
