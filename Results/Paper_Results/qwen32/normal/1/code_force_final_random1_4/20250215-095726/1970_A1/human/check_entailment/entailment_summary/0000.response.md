### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program step-by-step to ensure it meets the problem description.

1. **Class Definition (`BalanceInfo`)**:
   - This class is used to store information about each character in the parentheses sequence, specifically its balance, position, and the character itself.
   - This setup is necessary to keep track of the balance and position for sorting purposes.

2. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects and a variable `balance` to keep track of the current balance of the sequence.
   - **Building `balance_info` List**: It iterates through the input string `s`. For each character, it appends a `BalanceInfo` object to the list, capturing the current balance, the position of the character, and the character itself.
     - If the character is `'('`, it increments the balance.
     - If the character is `')'`, it decrements the balance.
   - **Sorting**: The list `balance_info` is sorted using a lambda function as the key. The sorting criteria are:
     - First, by `balance` in ascending order.
     - Second, by `position` in descending order (achieved by negating the position value).
   - **Generating Result**: After sorting, the function constructs the resulting string by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list.
   - **Output**: Finally, it prints the resulting string.

3. **Comparison with Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires us to create a new sequence by sorting the original sequence based on the balance of prefixes and resolving ties by position in descending order.
   - The provided code correctly implements this logic by creating a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, sorting them according to the specified criteria, and constructing the final sequence from the sorted list.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
