After the loop has executed all its iterations, the following will be the state of the variables:

- The variable `s` remains unchanged as it is the input string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of the string `s`.
- The variable `balance_info` will be a list containing `n` elements, each of which is an instance of `BalanceInfo`. Each `BalanceInfo` object will contain the balance at that point in the iteration, the index `i`, and the character `s[i]` from the string `s`.
- The variable `balance` will be 0 because the string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, meaning that every opening parenthesis "(" has a corresponding closing parenthesis ")", resulting in a net balance of 0 after processing the entire string.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an instance of `BalanceInfo` with the balance, index, and character at that index; `balance` is 0.**
