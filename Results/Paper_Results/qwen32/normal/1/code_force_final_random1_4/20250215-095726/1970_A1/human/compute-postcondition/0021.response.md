The given code sorts the `balance_info` list based on two criteria: primarily by the `balance` attribute in ascending order, and secondarily by the `position` attribute in descending order. This means that elements with lower balance values will come first, and among elements with the same balance value, the one with the higher position will appear first.

Since the sorting operation does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, `balance`, or the individual `BalanceInfo` instances themselves, only the order of elements within the `balance_info` list changes.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, each being an instance of `BalanceInfo` with the balance, index, and character at that index, sorted by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order for elements with the same balance; `balance` is 0.**
