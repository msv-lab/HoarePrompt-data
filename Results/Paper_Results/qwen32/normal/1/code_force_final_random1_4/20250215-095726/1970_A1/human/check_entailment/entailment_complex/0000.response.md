### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and verify whether it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

1. **Class Definition (`BalanceInfo`)**:
   - The `BalanceInfo` class is used to store information about each character in the input string `s`, specifically its balance and position.
   
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function compares two `BalanceInfo` objects, `infoA` and `infoB`.
   - It first checks if the balances of `infoA` and `infoB` are different. If they are, it returns the difference between their balances.
   - If the balances are the same, it returns the negative difference between their positions (which effectively sorts them in decreasing order of position).
   - This function is intended to be used as a key for sorting `BalanceInfo` objects.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes the input string `s` and initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It iterates through the string `s`, updating the balance as it encounters opening and closing parentheses.
   - For each character, it creates a `BalanceInfo` object and appends it to `balance_info`.
   - After constructing the list of `BalanceInfo` objects, it sorts them using the `func_1` function as the key.
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects and prints it.

### Verification:

- **Sorting Logic**:
  - The sorting logic implemented in `func_2` matches the problem description. It sorts the characters based on their balance in increasing order, and in case of ties, it sorts by position in decreasing order.
  
- **Result Construction**:
  - After sorting, the characters are joined to form the final result string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It constructs the necessary data structures, sorts them according to the specified rules, and produces the correct output.

### Your Response:
Reasoning: The provided code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation by constructing a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, sorting them based on balance and position, and then forming the result string from the sorted list.
Correctness: **True**
