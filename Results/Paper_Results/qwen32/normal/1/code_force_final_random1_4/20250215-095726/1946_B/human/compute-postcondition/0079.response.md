The code appends the value of `smin[i]` to the list `smin`. Given that `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, the value being appended is the last element of `smin` before the append operation.

Output State: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], l[0] + l[1] + l[2], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is `[0, min(suf[i + 1], smin[i]), ..., min(suf[i + 1], smin[i]), smin[i]]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`.**
This means that `smin` now has an additional element at the end, which is the same as its last element before the append operation. All other variables remain unchanged.
