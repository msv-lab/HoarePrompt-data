The code snippet updates the value of `sm` to `suf[i] - smin[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged unless the new value of `sm` is greater than its current value or if `sm` was initially set to -111.

Given the initial state, `sm` could be -111 or some other value. Since the problem doesn't specify the initial value of `sm` other than it could be -111, we'll consider both possibilities:

1. If `sm` was initially -111, it will be updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]`.
2. If `sm` was not -111, it will be updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]` only if `suf[i] - smin[i]` is greater than the current value of `sm`.

The list of `n+1` zeros is not affected by this operation. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but since the increment operation is mentioned in the initial state and not in the code snippet, we focus on the changes made by the given code.

Output State: **[0, 0, 0, ..., 0] (a list of `n+1` zeros), `sm` is updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.
