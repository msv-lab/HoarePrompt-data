The code snippet `b = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1. This value of `t` is not affected by the execution of the given code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `b` is a list of substrings from the input line split by whitespace.**
