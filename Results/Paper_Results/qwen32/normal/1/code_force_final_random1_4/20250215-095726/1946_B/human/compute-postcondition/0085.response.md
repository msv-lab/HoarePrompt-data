The given code updates the value of `sm` to `suf[i] - smin[i]`. Given the initial conditions, `sm` was either `-111` or the maximum difference found so far between corresponding elements of `suf` and `smin`. After executing the line `sm = suf[i] - smin[i]`, `sm` will now hold the value of `suf[i] - smin[i]`.

Output State: **`smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `sm` is `suf[i] - smin[i]`.**
