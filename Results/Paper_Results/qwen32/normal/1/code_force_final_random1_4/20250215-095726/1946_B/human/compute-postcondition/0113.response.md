The given code snippet appends a new element to the list `suf`. This new element is the sum of the current last element of `suf` (which is `suf[i]`) and the element at index `i` of the list `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `suf` is `[0, l[0]]`
- `i` is `1`

After executing the line `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])`:
- `suf[i]` is `l[0]`
- `l[i]` is `l[1]`
- Therefore, `suf.append(l[0] + l[1])` is executed, making `suf` now `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1]]`

The other variables (`smin`, `sm`, `j`, `t`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`smin` remains `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`; `sm` is updated based on its original value; `j` is `j + 1`; `t` remains the same; `b` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `n` is `int(b[0])` and must be greater than 0; `k` is `int(b[1])`; `l` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the split input line to integers; `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1]]`; `i` is 1**
