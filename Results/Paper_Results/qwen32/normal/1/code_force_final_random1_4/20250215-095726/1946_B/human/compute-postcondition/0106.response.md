Output State: **`smin` remains `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`; `sm` is updated based on its original value; `j` is `j + 1`; `t` remains the same; `b` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `n` is `int(b[0])`; `k` is `int(b[1])`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, which was obtained by splitting the input line. All other variables retain their original values as specified in the initial state.
