To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which is just `i` in this case. The loop iterates over the range of `n`, so the only variable that needs adjustment is `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `smin` is `[0]` if `suf[i + 1]` is not less than `smin[i]`; otherwise, `smin` is `[0, suf[i + 1]]`.
- `sm` is updated based on its original value (the exact update is not specified, but it doesn't affect the loop head).
- `j` is `j + 1`.
- `t` remains the same.
- `b` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` is `int(b[1])`.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the split input line to integers.
- `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, to start the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`smin` is `[0]` if `suf[i + 1]` is not less than `smin[i]`; otherwise, `smin` is `[0, suf[i + 1]]`, `sm` is updated based on its original value, `j` is `j + 1`, `t` remains the same, `b` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `int(b[1])`, `l` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the split input line to integers, and `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not provided, we express the state in terms of `i + 1`.
