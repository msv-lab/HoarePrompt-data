The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer, storing these integers in a new list `l`. This operation does not affect the existing variables `smin`, `sm`, `j`, `t`, `b`, `n`, or `k`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`smin` remains `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`; `sm` is updated based on its original value; `j` is `j + 1`; `t` remains the same; `b` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `n` is `int(b[0])`; `k` is `int(b[1])`; `l` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the split input line to integers.**
