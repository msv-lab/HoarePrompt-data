The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (which we can infer is `0` for the first iteration, `1` for the second, and so on), and `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `n` should remain the same.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not specify the exact value of `i`, we assume it has just finished an iteration where `i` was some value, say `x`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `x + 1`.

However, since we don't have the exact value of `x`, we can generalize that if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`. But for the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume the previous iteration ended with `i` being `0` (the first iteration). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `b` is a list of substrings from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than or equal to 1; `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`; `l` is a list of integers from the newly read input line split by whitespace; `suf` is `[0, l[0]]; `i` is 1**
