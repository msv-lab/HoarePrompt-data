Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state.

Initial State: 
- The list consists of elements all being 0.
- `sm` is equal to `suf[n]`.
- The current value of `sm` is less than 0.
- `a` is `abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

Code Snippet:
```python
sm += (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

Impact:
- The value of `sm` is updated by adding `(a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)` to it.

Given that `sm` is initially less than 0, and `a` is calculated as `abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)`, we can deduce the following:

1. `abs(sm)` is the absolute value of `sm`, which is a positive number since `sm` is less than 0.
2. `a` is the integer division of `abs(sm)` by `(10 ** 9 + 7)`, which means `a` is a non-negative integer.
3. `(a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)` is a large positive number because `(10 ** 9 + 7)` is a large constant.
4. Adding this large positive number to `sm` (which is negative) will make `sm` positive unless `sm` is extremely close to zero and `a` is very small, but generally, `sm` will become a large positive number.

Therefore, the new value of `sm` will be a large positive number, specifically `sm + (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

Other variables (`suf[n]`, the list of elements all being 0, and `a`) remain unchanged except for `sm`.

Output State: **The list consists of elements all being 0, `sm` is a large positive number equal to `sm + (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)`, `a` is `abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)` before the update.**
