The given code snippet modifies the value of `sm` by taking its modulus with \(10^9 + 7\). This operation ensures that `sm` remains within a specific range, which is a common practice in programming to prevent integer overflow and to meet problem constraints.

Given the initial state:
- `smin` is defined as a list where each element is the minimum of the corresponding element in `suf` and the previous element in `smin`.
- `sm` is initially set to `2 + suf[n]` and is guaranteed to be non-negative.

After executing the line `sm = sm % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, the value of `sm` is updated to be the remainder when `sm` is divided by \(10^9 + 7\).

Since `smin` is not modified by the code snippet, it retains its initial definition and values. The only change is to `sm`.

Output State: **`smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]` and `sm` is `(2 + suf[n]) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**.
