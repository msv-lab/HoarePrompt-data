Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum of the array after performing `k` operations. Here are some issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Subarray Sum**: The code attempts to find the maximum subarray sum using a suffix array and a minimum suffix array. However, the logic to calculate the maximum subarray sum is flawed. The formula `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm` is incorrect for calculating the contribution of the maximum subarray sum after `k` operations.

2. **Handling Negative Sums**: The program incorrectly handles negative sums by adding `(a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)` when `sm` is negative. This approach is not appropriate for this problem.

3. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation should be applied more carefully throughout the computation to ensure that intermediate results do not overflow and remain within the bounds of the modulo.

A correct approach would involve finding the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm and then determining how to maximize the sum after `k` operations by strategically inserting the maximum subarray sum. The correct formula for the maximum possible sum after `k` operations would be different from what is implemented in the given code.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    max_ending_here = max_so_far = arr[0]
    for x in arr[1:]:
        max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        total_sum = sum(arr)
        max_subarray = max_subarray_sum(arr)
        
        # If max_subarray is positive, we can keep adding it
        if max_subarray > 0:
            result = total_sum + max_subarray * k
        else:
            result = total_sum
        
        result %= MOD
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum and then calculates the result based on whether the maximum subarray sum is positive or not.
