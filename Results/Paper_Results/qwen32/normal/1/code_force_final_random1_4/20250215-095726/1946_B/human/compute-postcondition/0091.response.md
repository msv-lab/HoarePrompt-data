Output State: **`smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `sm` is `suf[i] - smin[i]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `sm` is calculated as the difference between `suf[i]` and `smin[i]`. The values of `smin`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` is now `i + 1`.
