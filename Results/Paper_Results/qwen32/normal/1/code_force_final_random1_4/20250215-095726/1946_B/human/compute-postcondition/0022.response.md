To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `i`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. However, since `i` is currently `n-1`, incrementing it by 1 would make `i` equal to `n`, which would cause the loop to terminate because the range function in Python generates numbers up to but not including `n`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be reset to `0` (the start of the range) if we are considering a fresh start of the loop. But based on the given context, it seems like we are continuing from where we left off, which means there is no next iteration possible if `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration.

However, if we interpret the task as resetting `i` to the start of the range for the sake of understanding how the loop would begin, then:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `b` is a list of substrings from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`; `l` is a list of integers from the newly read input line split by whitespace; `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[0:i+1]) for i in range(n)]`; `i` is 0.**

But strictly adhering to the context where `i` was `n-1` and there is no next iteration possible, the state remains the same with `i` being `n-1` and the loop terminating.

So the correct interpretation based on the given context is:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `b` is a list of substrings from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than 0; `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`; `l` is a list of integers from the newly read input line split by whitespace; `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[0:i+1]) for i in range(n)]`; `i` is n-1.** (indicating the loop has ended)
