The code appends the value of `smin[i]` to the list `smin`. Given the initial state, `smin` already contains elements calculated based on the minimum values of subsequent elements in `suf` up to index `i`. After appending `smin[i]`, the list `smin` will have one additional element.

Output State: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], l[0] + l[1] + l[2], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is `[0, min(suf[i + 1], smin[i]), ..., smin[i], smin[i]]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is i + 1`**

In natural language: The list `suf` remains unchanged. The list `smin` now includes an additional element at the end, which is the same as `smin[i]`. The value of `n` and `i` remain the same except that `i` is incremented by 1.
