To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Here's the given state before the loop starts:
- `smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`
- `sm` is `-111`

And the `for` loop statement:
```python
for i in range(n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:** This variable is the loop counter and will be automatically initialized to `0` when the loop starts. Therefore, there's no need to explicitly set `i` before the loop begins.

2. **Variable `n`:** The loop will iterate from `0` to `n` (inclusive), meaning it will execute `n + 1` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least `0`.

### Conclusion:
The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `n`. It must be set to a value such that the loop can execute at least once. Therefore, `n` should be `0` or greater.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `sm` is `-111`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**
