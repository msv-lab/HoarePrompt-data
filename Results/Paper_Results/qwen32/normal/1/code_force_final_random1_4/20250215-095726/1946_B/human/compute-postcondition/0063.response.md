To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is just `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `suf` has a new element appended which is `suf[i] + l[i]`.

Since the loop head only involves `i` and `n`, we need to adjust these two variables for the next iteration.

1. **Adjusting `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again from its current value.

2. **Adjusting `n`:**
   - The condition `n` must be greater than `i + 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue executing. Since `i` is being incremented, `n` must remain greater than the new value of `i + 1`.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 2` (since it gets incremented again).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `i + 2`.
- `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`; `i` is `i + 2`**.
