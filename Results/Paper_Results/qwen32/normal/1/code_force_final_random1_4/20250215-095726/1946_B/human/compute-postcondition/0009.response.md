To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

Given Code:
```python
suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])
```

This line of code appends a new element to the list `suf`. The new element is calculated as the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an input integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `b` is a list of substrings from the input line split by whitespace.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`.
- `l` is a list of integers from the newly read input line split by whitespace.
- `suf` is a list containing the single element `[0]`.

### Impact of the Code:
- The code modifies the list `suf` by appending a new element.
- The new element is the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]`.

### Calculation:
- Initially, `suf` is `[0]`.
- Let's assume `i` is defined and within the bounds of `suf` and `l`. Since `suf` initially has only one element, `i` must be `0` to avoid an `IndexError`.
- Therefore, the new element appended to `suf` is `suf[0] + l[0]`, which is `0 + l[0]` because `suf[0]` is `0`.

### Updated Output State:
- `suf` now contains two elements: `[0, l[0]]`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `b` is a list of substrings from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than or equal to 1; `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`; `l` is a list of integers from the newly read input line split by whitespace; `suf` is `[0, l[0]]`**.
