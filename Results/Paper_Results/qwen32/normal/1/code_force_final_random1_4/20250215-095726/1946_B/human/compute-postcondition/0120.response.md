Output State: **`smin` is `[0, suf[i + 1]]`, `sm` is updated based on its original value, `j` is `j + 1`, `t` remains the same, `b` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is `int(b[1])`, `l` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the split input line to integers, `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`. Additionally, `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`.**

Explanation: The list `smin` now includes the new element `suf[i + 1]` appended to it. All other variables retain their original states and conditions.
