Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`
- `sm` is `2 + suf[n]` and its current value is less than 0.

Code Snippet:
```python
a = abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

Impact:
- The variable `a` is assigned the value of `abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- Since `sm` is less than 0, `abs(sm)` will be `-sm`, which is a positive value.
- The division `//` is an integer division, meaning it will yield the largest whole number less than or equal to the division result.
- The divisor `(10 ** 9 + 7)` is a large constant, typically used in competitive programming for modulo operations to prevent overflow.

Output State:
- `smin` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code snippet.
- `sm` remains unchanged as it is only read, not modified.
- `a` is assigned the value of `abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], smin[0]), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`; `sm` is `2 + suf[n]` and its current value is less than 0; `a` is `abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)`**.
