The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `suf`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables (`sm`, `j`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`). Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `suf` list.

Output State: **The list remains `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]`; if `sm` was initially negative, `sm` becomes `sm + ((abs(sm) // (10))`, otherwise, `sm` becomes `((2^k - 1) * sm + suf[n]) % (10)`; `j` is `j + 1`; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is `int(b[0])`; `k` is `int(b[1])`; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `suf` is an empty list.**
