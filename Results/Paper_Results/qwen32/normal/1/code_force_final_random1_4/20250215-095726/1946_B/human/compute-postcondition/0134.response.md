In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range from 0 to `n` inclusive. The loop head involves the variable `i` and the value `n + 1`. To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be such that `n + 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` should be at least 0.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

- The initial state of the list `[0, 0, ..., 0]` (with `n+1` zeros) does not affect the execution of the loop directly, as the loop only depends on the range defined by `n`.
- The variable `sm` is initialized to `-111`, but this does not influence the loop's execution either, as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is at least 0 so that the range `range(n + 1)` contains at least one element, allowing the loop to execute.

State: **[0, 0, ..., 0] (n+1 zeros), `sm` is -111, `n` must be at least 0**
