Output State: **The list `suf` has at least `i+1` elements, and the list `smin` has at least `i+1` elements. The list initially contains `n+1` zeros. The variable `sm` is updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]` if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm`; otherwise, it remains unchanged. The variable `n` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `sm` is updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]` if `suf[i] - smin[i]` is greater than the current value of `sm`. Otherwise, `sm` retains its original value. All other conditions and values remain the same.
