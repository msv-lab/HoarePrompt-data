Given the initial state, we have the following variables with their respective values:
- `a` is a list containing the elements `[5, 5, 5, 6, 7]`
- `p_1` is set to `5`
- `p_2` is set to `5`
- `p_3` is set to `5`
- `p_4` is set to `6`
- `cnt` is set to `13`

The Python code snippet provided is:
```python
print(cnt)
```

This code simply prints the value of the variable `cnt`.

Based on the initial state, the value of `cnt` is explicitly given as `13`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the value of `cnt`, which is `13`.

Output: **13**
