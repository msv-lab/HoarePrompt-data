The code snippet increments the variable `cnt` by the floor division of `x` by 2. Given that `x` is the next element in the list `a` and `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, the exact value of `x` is not specified, but we know it is an integer.

The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `p_4` remain unchanged, and `cnt` is updated.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least two integers; `x` is the next element in `a`; `p_1` is 5; `p_2` is 5; `p_3` is 5; `p_4` is 6; `cnt` is incremented by `math.floor(x / 2)`**.
