To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `cnt` variable based on the input values. The loop reads a list of four integers (`a`) and calculates a count (`cnt`) based on these integers. Specifically, it adds the floor division of each integer by 2 to `cnt`. Additionally, if the first three integers are equal and odd, it increments `cnt` by 1.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, let's break down the calculations:

### Iteration 1:
- Input: `a = [p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4]`
- Calculation: `cnt = math.floor(p_1 / 2) + math.floor(p_2 / 2) + math.floor(p_3 / 2) + math.floor(p_4 / 2)`
- If `p_1 == p_2 == p_3` and `p_1 % 2 == 1`, then `cnt += 1`

### Iteration 2:
- Input: `a = [5, 5, 5, 6]`
- Calculation: `cnt = math.floor(5 / 2) + math.floor(5 / 2) + math.floor(5 / 2) + math.floor(6 / 2) = 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 9`
- Since `5 == 5 == 5` and `5 % 2 == 1`, `cnt += 1`
- Total `cnt` after iteration 2: `9 + 1 = 10`

However, the problem statement indicates that the output state after the second iteration is `cnt = 13`. This suggests there might be an additional increment or a different interpretation, but based on the given code, the calculation should be as described above. Let's assume the problem statement has a specific context or additional inputs that we need to consider.

### Iteration 3:
- Input: `a = [5, 5, 5, 6]` (same as iteration 2)
- Calculation: `cnt = 9 + 1 = 10` (same as iteration 2)
- Total `cnt` after iteration 3: `10 + 13 = 23` (assuming the problem statement's `cnt` includes previous sums)

Since the problem does not specify further changes in the input values for subsequent iterations, we will assume the same input for each iteration and calculate accordingly.

### General Iteration:
- For each iteration, the `cnt` is calculated as described above.
- If the first three elements are equal and odd, an additional 1 is added to `cnt`.

### Final Output State:
Given that the loop runs `t` times and the input remains the same for each iteration, the final `cnt` will be the sum of `cnt` values from each iteration.

Let's calculate the final `cnt` for `t` iterations with the input `[5, 5, 5, 6]`:

- For each iteration: `cnt = 10` (as calculated above)
- Total `cnt` after `t` iterations: `10 * t`

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `t`, we can generalize the final output state.

Output State: **10 * t**

In natural language: The final output state after all iterations of the loop is `10` times the number of iterations `t`, assuming the input remains `[5, 5, 5, 6]` for each iteration.
