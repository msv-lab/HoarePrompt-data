The code snippet reassigns the list `a` to the values provided by the user input, which are split by spaces and converted to integers. The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p_4`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `p_1` is 5, `p_2` is 5, `p_3` is 5, `p_4` is 6, `cnt` is 13**.
