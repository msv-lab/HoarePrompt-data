Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates a value based on these counts and prints the result. Specifically, it checks if the counts of ones, twos, and threes are equal and odd, and if so, increments a counter. Then, it adds half the value of each count (rounded down) to the counter. This process is repeated for each of the \( t \) test cases.**
