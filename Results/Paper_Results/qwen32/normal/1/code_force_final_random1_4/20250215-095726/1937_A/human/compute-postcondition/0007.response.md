The code snippet changes the value of `n` by assigning it the base-2 logarithm of its current value. Given that `n` is an input integer and not equal to 1, the new value of `n` will be the logarithm of the original `n` to the base 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 0, `n` is `log2(n)`, `power` is 1.**

In natural language: The value of `n` is updated to be the base-2 logarithm of its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
