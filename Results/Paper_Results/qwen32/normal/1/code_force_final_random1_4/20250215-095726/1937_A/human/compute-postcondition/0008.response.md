To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `power < n`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Condition**: The loop condition involves `power` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Current Values**:
   - `power` is initialized to 1.
   - `n` is defined as `log2(n)`, but there seems to be a misunderstanding here because `n` should be derived from some value, likely `t` given the context.

3. **Correct the Misunderstanding**: Since `n` is supposed to be `log2(t)` (assuming `t` is the intended input for the logarithm), we need to ensure that `n` is calculated correctly based on `t`.

4. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `power < n` must be true.
   - Given `power` starts at 1, `n` must be greater than 1.

5. **Adjust `t` to Ensure `n > 1`**:
   - Since `n = log2(t)`, `log2(t) > 1` implies `t > 2`.
   - Therefore, `t` must be at least 3 to ensure `n` is greater than 1.

6. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `t` must be at least 3.
   - `n_cases` is equal to `t`, so `n_cases` must also be at least 3.
   - `i` is 0 and `power` is 1, which do not need adjustment as they satisfy the condition for the first iteration when `n > 1`.

Thus, the adjusted state to ensure the loop executes at least once is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 0, `n` is `log2(n_cases)`, `power` is 1**
