Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n_cases` is equal to `t`.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer, and it is explicitly stated that `n` is equal to 1.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print(1)
```

The `print(1)` statement directly prints the integer `1`.

There are no variables or conditions in the print statement itself that depend on the values of `t`, `n_cases`, `i`, or `n`. The print statement is straightforward and outputs the literal value `1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply `1`.

Output: **1**
