To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop condition. In this case, the loop condition is `while power < n:`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `power` is indeed less than `n` for the loop to execute again.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n_cases` is equal to `t`
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `power` is 3

The only variables in the loop condition are `power` and `n`. Since `power` is 3, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3. The values of `t`, `n_cases`, and `i` do not affect the loop condition directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be modified such that `n` is greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `power` is 3**
