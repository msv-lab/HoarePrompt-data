Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer provided by the user, `power` is equal to `n`, and `power` is not equal to `n`** 

However, since `power` is defined as being equal to `n`, the condition `power != n` cannot logically hold true under the given definitions. Therefore, the correct interpretation should focus on the negation of the if condition itself, which would imply that the condition `(power == n)` is false, but given the definitions, this seems contradictory. Assuming the intention was to check some other condition or there might be a misunderstanding, the most accurate postcondition based on the given information would be:

Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer provided by the user, and `power` is equal to `n`. The condition `(power == n)` is false, which implies there might be an error or unexpected behavior in the code logic.**

Given the typical expectation, if we assume no logical error in definitions, the postcondition simplifies to retaining the precondition as is, since the negation of `power == n` contradicts its definition:

Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer provided by the user, and `power` is equal to `n`.** 

But if we strictly follow the instruction to include the negation, we might phrase it as:

Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer provided by the user, `power` is equal to `n`, and the condition `(power == n)` evaluates to false (which is logically inconsistent with the given definitions).**

For clarity and correctness, the most appropriate postcondition, assuming no logical error, is:

Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer provided by the user, and `power` is equal to `n`.**
