To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and when it terminates. The loop increments the variable `power` by 1 until `power` is no longer less than `n`. Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute three times. 

Since the loop continues until `power` is no longer less than `n`, the final value of `power` will be equal to `n`. Therefore, the loop will terminate when `power` equals `n`.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is an input parameter and not modified within the loop.
- `n_cases` remains equal to `t`.
- `i` remains 1 as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer provided by the user.
- `power` will be equal to `n` after the loop terminates.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer provided by the user, `power` is equal to `n`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `power` will have the same value as `n`, which is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer, while all other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
