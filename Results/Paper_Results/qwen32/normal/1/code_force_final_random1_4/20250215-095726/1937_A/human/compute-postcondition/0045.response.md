The code snippet modifies the value of `n` by assigning it the base-2 logarithm of its current value. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `power`) remain unchanged.

Given that `n` was initially provided by the user, after executing the code, `n` will hold the value of `log2(n)`, where `log2` is the base-2 logarithm function.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n_cases` is equal to `t`; `i` is 2; `n` is `log2(n)`; `power` is 1.**
