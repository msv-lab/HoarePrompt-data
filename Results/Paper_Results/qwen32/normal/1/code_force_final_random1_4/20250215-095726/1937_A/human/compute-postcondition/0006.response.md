The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `power`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, `n`) are modified by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `n` is not equal to 1; `power` is 1.**
