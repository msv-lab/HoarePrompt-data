Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` is equal to `t`.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is calculated as `log2(n_cases)`, which is equivalent to `log2(t)`.
- `power` is calculated as `log2(t) - 1`.
- It is explicitly stated that `power` is not equal to `n`.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet contains the following print statement:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `t`:** `t` can be any integer from 1 to \(10^4\). For the sake of explanation, let's assume `t` is a specific value, say `t = 8`.
2. **Calculate `n_cases`:** Since `n_cases` is equal to `t`, `n_cases` is also 8.
3. **Calculate `n`:** `n` is `log2(n_cases)`, which is `log2(8) = 3`.
4. **Calculate `power`:** `power` is `log2(t) - 1`, which is `log2(8) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`.
5. **Verify the Condition:** The condition states that `power` is not equal to `n`. In our example, `power` is 2 and `n` is 3, so the condition holds true.

### Print Statement Execution:
The print statement `print(2 ** power)` will evaluate to `2 ** 2`, which is 4.

### Generalization:
For any valid `t` within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `power` will always be `log2(t) - 1`. Therefore, `2 ** power` will be `2 ** (log2(t) - 1)`, which simplifies to `t / 2` (rounded down to the nearest integer if `t` is not a power of 2).

However, since the exact value of `t` is not specified, we can describe the output in terms of `t`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output `2 ** power`, where `power` is `log2(t) - 1`.

Output: **2 ** (log2(t) - 1)**
