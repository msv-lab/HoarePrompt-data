The code snippet `b = input()` assigns the value of the next input to the variable `b`. This means that `b` will now hold whatever string is provided as input.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is the length of the strings representing the rows of the grid, and `a` is already an input string. After executing the code, `b` will be another input string of the same length `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string, and `b` is the newly input string of length `n`.**
