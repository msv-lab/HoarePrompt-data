Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both `<` with `i + 1 < n`, or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both `<`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, and the conditions on `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
