In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable used just for iteration and does not affect the loop's execution condition. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The other variables (`n`, the two strings representing the rows of the grid) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to control whether the loop executes.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.

The state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is within this range to guarantee that the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; each of the two strings representing the rows of the grid consists of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'**
