The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` from its initial state to the newly input value. The other variables `t` and the strings representing the rows of the grid remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; each of the two strings representing the rows of the grid consists of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'**.
