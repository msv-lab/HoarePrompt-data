`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`n`, the strings representing the rows of the grid) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; each of the two strings representing the rows of the grid consists of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'**.
