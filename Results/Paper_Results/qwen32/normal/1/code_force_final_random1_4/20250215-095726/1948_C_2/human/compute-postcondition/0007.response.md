Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is another input string of length `n`.
- At the current index `i`, either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both `<` and `i + 1 < n`, or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both `<`.

The `print` statement in the code is:

```python
print('No')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not change based on the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **No**
