Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 5, `a` is the input string, `b` is the newly input string of length `n`, and `i` is 5 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
