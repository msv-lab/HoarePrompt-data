Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `k` is set to 1.
- `best` is the same as `k`, so `best` is also 1.
- `res` is the value of the user's input for the last iteration (the exact value is not specified).
- `i` is set to `n-1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The string `'?'` is a literal string and will be printed as is.
- `0` is a literal integer and will be printed as is.
- `k` is explicitly defined as `1`, so it will be printed as `1`.
- Another `0` is a literal integer and will be printed as is.
- `i` is defined as `n-1`. Since `n` is greater than 2, `i` will be at least `1` (if `n` is `3`), but without knowing the exact value of `n`, we can only say that `i` is `n-1`.
- `flush=True` is an argument to the `print` function that forces the output to be written to the console immediately, but it does not affect the content being printed.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the output will be the string `'?'` followed by the integers `0`, `1`, `0`, and `n-1` (where `n` is the value greater than 2).

Output: **? 0 1 0 n-1 (where n is the value greater than 2)**
