Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is the new input integer; `k` is 1; `best` is the same as `k`; `res` is the value of the user's input for the last iteration; `i` is `n-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been explicitly set to 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
