To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(2, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³;
- `n` is greater than 2;
- `k` is `n-1` if `res` equals `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1;
- `best` is 1;
- `res` is the value of the user's input;
- `i` is `n-1`.

Since `i` is currently `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, it means that the loop condition `i < n` is no longer satisfied (because `n-1` is not less than `n`). Therefore, the loop does not execute another iteration.

However, if we hypothetically consider what the state would be right before the loop terminates (which is essentially the start of the next iteration if it were to continue), we would increment `i` by 1. But since `i` is already `n-1`, the next value of `i` would be `n`, and the loop would terminate.

Thus, there is no valid state where the loop can execute another iteration given that `i` is `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration.

But if we were to strictly follow the instruction to adjust the state as if the loop were to continue, we would have:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is greater than 2; `k` is `n-1` if `res` equals `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1; `best` is 1; `res` is the value of the user's input; `i` is `n`**

However, this state would mean the loop condition is no longer satisfied, and thus the loop would not execute. The correct interpretation here is that the loop has already terminated.

So, the final answer considering the loop termination is that no further iterations occur, but if hypothetically adjusting for the next iteration state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is greater than 2; `k` is `n-1` if `res` equals `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1; `best` is 1; `res` is the value of the user's input; `i` is `n`**
