The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i_prev + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, making it `i_prev + 2`.

Since `n` is greater than 2, for the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must remain greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `t`, `res`, and `k` are not part of the loop head, their values do not need to be adjusted.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is greater than 2; `res` is the new input string; if `res` is `<`, then `k` is equal to `i`; otherwise, `k` remains 1; `i` is `i_prev + 2`**
