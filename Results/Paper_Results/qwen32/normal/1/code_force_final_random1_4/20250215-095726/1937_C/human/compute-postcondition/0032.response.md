To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Here's the given information:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `res` is the value of `input()`.
- If `res` equals `<`, `best` is set to the value of `i`.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`.
2. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again.
3. `n` remains the same as it is the upper limit of the range.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.
- `n` will remain the same.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration other than it being incremented by 1, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` (where `i` is the value at the end of the previous iteration).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is greater than 1**.

However, to be more precise in terms of the variable names, if we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

So, the final state can be written as:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is greater than 1**.

Since we need to specify the exact state in terms of the variable `i`:
State: **`i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is greater than 1**.

For clarity, if we assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then:
State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `n` is greater than 1**.

But sticking to the general form without assuming a specific value for `i` at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is greater than 1**.
