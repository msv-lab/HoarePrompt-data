To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(2, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will iterate over the range starting from 2 up to, but not including, `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one value. This means that the starting point (2) must be less than the endpoint (`n`). Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2.

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The variable `i` is the loop variable and its initial value is determined by the range function, so we don't need to set it explicitly before the loop starts. The variable `n` is the upper bound of the range and must be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.

Given that `t` and `k` are mentioned in the initial state but are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` must be greater than 2; `k` is 1**
