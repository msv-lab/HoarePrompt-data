Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is greater than 1; if `res` equals `'<'`, then `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or `1` if no such response was received, and `best` is set to `i`. If `res` does not equal `'<'`, `k` and `best` retain their original values.**
