To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` is greater than 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement contains several variables: `k`, `best`, and `i`.
- `i` is described as being incremented by 1 from its previous value, but we don't know its previous value.
- `k` and `best` are not described in the initial state, so their values are unknown.
- `flush=True` is an argument that ensures the output is immediately flushed to the console, but it does not affect the content of the output.

### Output Description:
Given the lack of specific values for `k`, `best`, and the previous value of `i`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `k` will be printed as whatever its current value is.
- `best` will be printed as whatever its current value is.
- `k` is printed again, so it will appear twice in the output.
- `i` will be printed as its current value, which is one more than its previous value.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [k] [best] [k] [i] (where k is the value of k, best is the value of best, and i is the value of i after being incremented by 1)**
