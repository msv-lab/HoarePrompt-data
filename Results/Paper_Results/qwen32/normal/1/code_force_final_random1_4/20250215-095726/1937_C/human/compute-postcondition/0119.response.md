Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴). For each test case, it interacts with an external process by sending queries and receiving responses to determine two specific indices, `k` and `best`, and then outputs these indices. The final state of the program after processing all test cases is that it has output the determined indices for each test case.**
