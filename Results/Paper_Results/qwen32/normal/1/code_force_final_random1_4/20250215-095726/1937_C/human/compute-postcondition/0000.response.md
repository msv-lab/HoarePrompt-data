In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the input value `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable when the loop variable itself is not used inside the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than or equal to 1. The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted since it is not referenced within the loop body.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts already ensures that the loop can execute, provided `t` is within the specified range. No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³**
