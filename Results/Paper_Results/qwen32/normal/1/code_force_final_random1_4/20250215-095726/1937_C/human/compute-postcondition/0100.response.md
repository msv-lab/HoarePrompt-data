To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their descriptions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n`: An integer greater than 2.
   - `k`: The largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) for which `res` was `<`, or 1 if no such `i` exists.
   - `best`: An integer initialized to 0.
   - `res`: The value of the user's input for the last iteration.
   - `i`: An integer initialized to 1.

2. **Given Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the values of `k` and `i`:**
   - Since `i` is explicitly stated to be initialized to 1, we know `i = 1`.
   - The value of `k` depends on the condition described: it is the largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) where `res` was `<` something (presumably a threshold or previous value). If no such `i` exists, `k` is set to 1.
   - Given that no specific value for `res` or the conditions leading to `k` are provided, we can only assume the worst-case scenario where no such `i` exists, making `k = 1`.

4. **Substitute the values into the print statement:**
   - `k = 1` (as per the assumption that no valid `i` was found).
   - `best = 0` (as per the initialization).
   - `i = 1` (as per the initialization).

5. **Formulate the output:**
   The print statement will output the following sequence of values: `'?'`, `k`, `best`, `k`, `i`.

Putting it all together, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? 1 0 1 1**
