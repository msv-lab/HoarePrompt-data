The code snippet assigns a new value to `n` by reading an integer from the input. This means the previous value of `n` is replaced by the new input value. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `best`, `res`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is the new input integer; `k` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or 1 if no such response was received; `best` is the same as `k`; `res` is the value of the user's input for the last iteration; `i` is `n-1`.**
