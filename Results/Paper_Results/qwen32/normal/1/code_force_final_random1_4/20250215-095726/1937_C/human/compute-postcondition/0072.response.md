Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
2. `n` is greater than 1.
3. `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or 1 if no such response was received.
4. `best` is the current value of `i` if `res` is `'<'`, otherwise `best` remains 0.
5. `res` is the value of the user's input.
6. `i` is 3.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

#### Values of Variables:
- `k`: This is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`. Since we don't have specific information about the responses, we can only say that `k` is either 1 (if no `'<'` responses were received) or some value between 2 and n-1.
- `best`: This is the current value of `i` if `res` is `'<'`. If `res` is not `'<'`, then `best` remains 0. Since `i` is 3 and we don't know the value of `res`, `best` could be 3 if `res` was `'<'` during the last iteration, or 0 otherwise.
- `i`: This is explicitly given as 3.

### Output Construction:
Given the above, the print statement will output:
- `'?'`: A literal question mark.
- `k`: The value of `k`, which is either 1 or some value between 2 and n-1.
- `best`: The value of `best`, which is either 3 (if `res` was `'<'`) or 0.
- `k`: Again, the value of `k`.
- `i`: The value of `i`, which is 3.

Since the exact values of `k` and `best` depend on the responses received, we can't provide a specific numerical value for them. However, we can describe their possible values based on the given conditions.

### Final Output Description:
Output: **? [k] [best] [k] 3 (where k is the largest index i (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was '<', or 1 if no such response was received, and best is the current value of i if res is '<', otherwise 0)**
