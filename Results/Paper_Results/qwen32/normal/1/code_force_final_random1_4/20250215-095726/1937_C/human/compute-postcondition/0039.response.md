The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times based on the input. The loop will execute `int(input())` times, and the value of `_` does not affect the program state in terms of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `best`.

Since the loop head does not contain `t`, `n`, `k`, or `best`, these variables should remain unchanged from the end of the previous iteration to the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is the input integer; `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or 1 if no such response was received; `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was received.**
