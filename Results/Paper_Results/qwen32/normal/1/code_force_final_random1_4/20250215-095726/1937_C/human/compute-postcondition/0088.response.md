Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `k` is `n-1` if `res` equals `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1.
- `best` is 1.
- `res` is the value of the user's input.
- `i` is `n`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Literal Values**: 
   - `'?'` is a literal string.
   - `0` is a literal integer.
   - `0` is another literal integer.

2. **Variables**:
   - `k`: This depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is `'<'`, then `k` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `k` is `1`.
   - `i`: This is explicitly stated to be `n`.

### Output Construction:
- The first part of the output is always `'?'`.
- The second part is always `0`.
- The third part is `k`, which is either `n-1` or `1` depending on `res`.
- The fourth part is always `0`.
- The fifth part is `i`, which is `n`.

### Final Output Description:
Given the above analysis, the output will be:
- `'?'` followed by `0`, then `k` (which is either `n-1` or `1`), then `0`, and finally `n`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 [k] 0 [n] (where k is n-1 if res is '<', otherwise k is 1, and n is the value of n)**
