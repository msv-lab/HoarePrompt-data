The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `best`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `best` will now also hold the value 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `res`, `k`, and any other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is the value of the user's new input, `k` retains its original value, `best` is 2.**
