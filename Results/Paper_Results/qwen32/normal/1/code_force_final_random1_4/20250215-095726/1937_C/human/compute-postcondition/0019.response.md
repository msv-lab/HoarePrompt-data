To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies its variables based on the input responses.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = n-1`.
- For each iteration, it prints a query and reads a response (`res`).
- If `res` is `'<'`, it updates `k` to the current value of `i`.
- The loop continues until `i` reaches `n-1`.

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes all iterations, `i` will have taken on every value from `2` to `n-1`. The variable `k` will be the last value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`. If no response was `'<'`, `k` will remain `1`.

### Output State Description:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is used to control the loop but not modified.
- `k` will be the largest index `i` (from `2` to `n-1`) for which the response was `'<'`. If no such response was received, `k` will be `1`.

### Final Output State in Required Format:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` is an input integer; `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to n-1) for which the response was `'<'`, or `1` if no such response was received.**
