The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `n` remains the same as long as it is greater than 3 for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is the value of the user's new input. If `res` equals `<`, then `best` is set to 2. Otherwise, `best` retains its original value.**
