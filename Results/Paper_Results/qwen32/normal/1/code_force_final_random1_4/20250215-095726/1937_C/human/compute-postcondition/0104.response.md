Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `res` is the value of the user's current input. If `res` equals `<`, then `k` is updated to the largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) for which `res` was `<`, or 1 if no such `i` exists, and `best` is set to 1. Otherwise, `k` and `best` retain their original values.**
