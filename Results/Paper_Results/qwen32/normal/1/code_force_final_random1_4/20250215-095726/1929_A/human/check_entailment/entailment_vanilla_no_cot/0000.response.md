Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array. The program only calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is not the same as the sum of all consecutive differences.

To correctly solve the problem, we should sort the array and then compute the sum of differences between each pair of consecutive elements. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        beauty = sum(a[i] - a[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

func()
```

This version sorts the array and computes the sum of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements, which gives the correct maximum beauty of the array.
