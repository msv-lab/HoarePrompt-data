You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step:

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array. Specifically, we want to maximize the expression:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

### Key Insight
To maximize this sum, we should arrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order. When the array is sorted, the largest possible difference \(a_n - a_1\) will contribute most significantly to the sum because it is the sum of all individual differences between consecutive elements.

### Simplification
However, the provided solution simplifies this by only considering the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted array:
\[ \text{Beauty} = a_{\text{max}} - a_{\text{min}} \]
This is not entirely correct because the beauty is actually the sum of all consecutive differences, not just the difference between the max and min.

### Correct Calculation
The correct approach to calculate the beauty is to sort the array and then compute the sum of differences between consecutive elements:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

### Example Verification
Let's verify with the first example:
- Input: `3 2 1 3`
- Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Beauty: `(2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2`

The provided solution would output `3-1=2`, which is correct for this specific case but does not generalize correctly.

### Conclusion
The provided solution is incorrect because it only considers the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, rather than the sum of all consecutive differences in the sorted array.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
