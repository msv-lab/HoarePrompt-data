### Reasoning:

To solve the problem of maximizing the beauty of the array, we need to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. 

To maximize this sum, we should arrange the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then considering the difference between the largest and smallest elements. However, simply taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements does not account for the intermediate differences.

A more optimal strategy is to alternate between the smallest and largest remaining elements. By doing so, we ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. For example, if we sort the array and then take elements alternately from the start and end, we can achieve the maximum possible beauty.

However, the provided code sorts the array and directly computes the difference between the last and first elements, which does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty. This approach works only when the array has a specific pattern or when the maximum difference between any two elements is the only contributing factor, but it does not consider the intermediate differences that could contribute to the beauty.

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- For the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, the sorted array is `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`. The provided code would output `100 - 43 = 57`, which is correct for this specific case because the maximum beauty is indeed achieved by the difference between the largest and smallest elements due to the nature of the array. However, this is not a general solution.

A correct approach would involve alternating between the smallest and largest elements, which ensures that we maximize the sum of all differences. Here is a corrected version of the approach:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        beauty = 0
        i, j = 0, n - 1
        while i < j:
            beauty += a[j] - a[i]
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        print(beauty)
```

Given the above reasoning, the provided code does not correctly compute the maximum beauty for all possible arrays. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
