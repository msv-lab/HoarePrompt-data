### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array optimally. The beauty can be maximized by arranging the array in either ascending or descending order. In both cases, the beauty is equivalent to the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array.

The provided program correctly identifies this optimal arrangement by sorting the array and then computing the difference between the last (maximum) and the first (minimum) elements of the sorted array. This approach ensures that the beauty of the array is maximized.

### Execution Summary:
- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
- It sorts the array.
- It computes the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted array.
- It prints this difference as the maximum beauty of the array.

This matches the expected behavior as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
