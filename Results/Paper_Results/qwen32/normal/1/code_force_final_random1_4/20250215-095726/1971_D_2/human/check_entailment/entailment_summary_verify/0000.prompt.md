You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1'. It then calculates and prints the number of segments in the string `s` where consecutive characters are different, reducing the count by one if there is at least one '01' transition in the string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Given a binary string, find the minimum number of pieces you need to cut it into so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.
- A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.
- Each character must lie in exactly one piece.
- The pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string.
- All pieces must be used in the rearrangement.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the string and counting transitions from '0' to '1'. It increments the count whenever it encounters a transition from '0' to '1', and then decrements the count by 1 if such a transition exists.

Here's the code again for reference:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)
```

### Potential Issues:
1. **Counting Transitions:** The program counts transitions from '0' to '1' and adds 1 to the count for each transition. This seems correct because each transition indicates a new segment that needs to be cut.
2. **Decrementing Count:** The program decrements the count by 1 if there is at least one '0' to '1' transition (`flag` is set to `True`). This decrement is intended to account for the fact that the last segment doesn't need an additional piece after the last '1'.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider the provided examples and some edge cases:

#### Provided Examples:
1. **Input:** `11010`
   - **Output:** `3`
   - **Explanation:** The transitions are at positions 1->2 ('1' to '0') and 3->4 ('0' to '1'). The final count is 3.
2. **Input:** `00000000`
   - **Output:** `1`
   - **Explanation:** No transitions, so the count remains 1.
3. **Input:** `1`
   - **Output:** `1`
   - **Explanation:** Single character, no transitions, count remains 1.
4. **Input:** `10`
   - **Output:** `2`
   - **Explanation:** One transition ('1' to '0'), count becomes 2.
5. **Input:** `0001111`
   - **Output:** `1`
   - **Explanation:** No transitions, count remains 1.
6. **Input:** `0110`
   - **Output:** `2`
   - **Explanation:** One transition ('0' to '1'), count becomes 2.

All these examples seem to produce the correct output.

#### Edge Cases:
1. **Input:** `01010101`
   - **Output:** `4`
   - **Explanation:** Transitions at positions 0->1, 2->3, 4->5, and 6->7. The final count is 5, but the flag is set, so it decrements to 4.
2. **Input:** `10101010`
   - **Output:** `4`
   - **Explanation:** Transitions at positions 0->1, 2->3, 4->5, and 6->7. The final count is 5, but the flag is set, so it decrements to 4.
3. **Input:** `000011110000`
   - **Output:** `2`
   - **Explanation:** Transitions at positions 3->4 and 7->8. The final count is 3, but the flag is set, so it decrements to 2.
4. **Input:** `11110000`
   - **Output:** `1`
   - **Explanation:** No transitions, count remains 1.

All edge cases also seem to produce the correct output.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and testing, the program appears to handle all cases correctly. There do not seem to be any scenarios where the program fails to produce the correct output according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
