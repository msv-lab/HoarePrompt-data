Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the new input string; `count` is 1; `flag` is False; `j` is `len(s) - 1`; `i` is `i+1` where `i` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The value of `flag` has been explicitly set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values.
