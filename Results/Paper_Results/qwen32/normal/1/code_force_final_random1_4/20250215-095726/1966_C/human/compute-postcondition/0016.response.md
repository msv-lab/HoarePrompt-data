The given code snippet only contains one line that reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This operation does not affect the other variables (`t`, `tc`, `arr`, `i`, `dp`) mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is provided by the input, while the other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `tc` must be at least 2, `n` is the integer read from the input, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`**.
