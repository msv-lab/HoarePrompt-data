Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tc` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while tc > 0:
    n = int(input())
    arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True
        ) + [0]
    dp = True
    n = len(arr) - 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp = arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp
    print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
    tc -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `tc` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is the number of unique integers in `arr`, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tc` is at least 1; `n` is `tc`; `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end; `i` is `n-2`; `dp` is `True` if `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1` or if any previous condition caused `dp` to become `False` and remained `False` until the end, otherwise `dp` is `False`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tc` is at least 0; `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end; `i` is `n-1`; `dp` is `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`; `n` is the length of `arr` minus one and must be greater than 1.`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
