To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the provided state.

The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means the loop will iterate over the range starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range function requires the stop value to be greater than the start value.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `tc` must be at least 2
- `n` is `tc`
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end
- `i` is `n-1`
- `dp` is `True`

From the loop definition, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute. Since `n` is set to `tc`, and `tc` must be at least 2, this condition is already satisfied by the problem constraints.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for `n` or `i` in terms of the loop execution condition. The other variables (`t`, `arr`, `dp`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `tc` is at least 2, `n` is `tc`, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is `True`**
