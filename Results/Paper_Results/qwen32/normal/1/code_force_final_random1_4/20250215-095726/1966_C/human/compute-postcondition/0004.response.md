The code snippet assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `dp`. This assignment does not affect the values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, or `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tc` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end; `dp` is `True`.**
