Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `tc` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end, `i` is `i + 1`, `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`.**

Explanation: The value of `dp` is updated to be the result of the expression `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
