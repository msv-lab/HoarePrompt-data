To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `tc > 0`.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `tc` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1
- `n` is the number of unique integers in `arr`
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end
- `i` is `n-1`
- `dp` is `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`

The loop condition is `tc > 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must still be greater than 0 after the decrement operation in the previous iteration.

Since `tc` has already been decremented by 1 in the previous iteration, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `tc` must have been at least 2 before the decrement (so that after decrementing by 1, it remains greater than 0).

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `tc` is at least 2 before the decrement operation.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `tc` must be at least 2, `n` is the number of unique integers in `arr`, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`**
