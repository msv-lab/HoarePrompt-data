Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tc` is 0; no further iterations will occur as the loop condition `tc > 0` is no longer satisfied.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` remains unchanged as it was initially set to some integer between 1 and 10,000. The variable `tc` is now 0, which means the loop condition `tc > 0` is no longer met, and thus the loop will not execute any more iterations. All other variables (`n`, `arr`, `dp`, `i`) do not have a consistent state across all iterations since they are re-initialized in each iteration of the loop.
