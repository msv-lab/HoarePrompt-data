Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tc` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `tc` is assigned the value of the input, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is part of the precondition describing the range within which `tc` should fall.
