The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `tc` must be greater than 0. The value of `n` is determined by the user's input and is converted to an integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tc` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer.**
