The given code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is provided as input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tc` is at least 1; `n` is the input integer; `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end; `i` is `n-2`; `dp` is `True` if `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1` or if any previous condition caused `dp` to become `False` and remained `False` until the end, otherwise `dp` is `False`**.
