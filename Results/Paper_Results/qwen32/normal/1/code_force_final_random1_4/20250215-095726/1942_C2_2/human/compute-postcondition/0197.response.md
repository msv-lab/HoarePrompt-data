Postcondition: **`2x - 2` remains unchanged, `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even that must contain at least one more element, `n` remains the first value provided in the input, `x` remains the second value provided in the input, `t` remains the same as it was before the decrement, `a` remains the same as it was before the modification, `st` remains the same as it was before the update, `gap` is the next element in the `even` list. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `ans` is now `ans + 2 * y` and `y` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `ans` and `y` remain unchanged.**
