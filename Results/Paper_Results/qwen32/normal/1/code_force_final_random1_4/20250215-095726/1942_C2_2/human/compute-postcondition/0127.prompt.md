Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tt` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(tt):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = x + y - 2
    tmp = []
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
            tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
            ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
            y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]
        ) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    ans += y
    print(min(ans, n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is equal to `len(a)` indicating the loop has completed. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, then `ans` is the final value after all iterations plus 1. Otherwise, `ans` is the final value after all iterations, and if the condition `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)` is true, then `ans` is incremented by `(a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]) // 2`, `tmp` includes the new value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is decremented by `((a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]) // 2 - 1)`. `tmp` is a list of values `(a[i] - a[i-1]) // 2` that met the second condition. `ans` is now `ans + y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is the sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified, `tmp` is a list of values `(a[i] - a[i-1]) // 2` that met the second condition, and `y` is updated based on the decrement operations, and `ans` is now `ans + y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tt` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is equal to `len(a)`; `ans` is updated by adding `y` to its previous value; `tmp` contains valid `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` values plus the newly appended value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` if the condition for updating `ans` with `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` is met; `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)` if the condition for updating `ans` with `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` is met; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input with `y` modified within the loop; `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is either equal to 2 or not equal to 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
