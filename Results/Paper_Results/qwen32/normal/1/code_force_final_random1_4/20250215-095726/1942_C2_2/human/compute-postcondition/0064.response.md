Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 2, and `ans` is the final value after all iterations (if applicable). If `(a[2] - a[1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is increased by `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, `tmp` contains `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, and `y` is updated to `y - ((a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1)`. Otherwise, `ans`, `tmp`, and `y` remain unchanged.**
