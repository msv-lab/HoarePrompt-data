The code snippet `y -= c` subtracts the value of `c` from `y`. Therefore, the value of `y` is updated to `y - c`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `y` is `y - c - c`, `R` is defined as a lambda function that maps input split by spaces to integers, `l` is a list of integers read from the input and split by spaces, now sorted in ascending order with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is a list containing the value of `c` for each iteration from 1 to `x`, sorted such that all even numbers come before odd numbers and within each group, the numbers are sorted in ascending order, `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and the original value of `cons`, `c` is `(val[k+1]) // 2`, `i` is `val[k+1]`. If `y < c`, `sx` is updated to `sx + y * 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `sx` is updated to `sx + i`.**
