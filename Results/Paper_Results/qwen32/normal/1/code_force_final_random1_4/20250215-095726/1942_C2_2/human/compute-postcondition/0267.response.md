Postcondition: **`2x - 2` remains unchanged, `n` is the first value provided in the input, `x` is the second value provided in the input and must be greater than 0, `t` is `t + x`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, each decreased by 1, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the modified list `a`, `odd` is a sorted list containing all odd gaps greater than 1 found during the iterations, `even` is a sorted list containing all even gaps greater than 0 found during the iterations, `i` is `x`, `odd` must contain at least one element other than `gap_current`. If `y < gap // 2`, then `ans` is `x - 2 + k + 4 * y + gap`, `y` is 0, `gap` is the next element in `odd` after `gap_current`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is `x - 2 + k + 2 * y + gap`.**
