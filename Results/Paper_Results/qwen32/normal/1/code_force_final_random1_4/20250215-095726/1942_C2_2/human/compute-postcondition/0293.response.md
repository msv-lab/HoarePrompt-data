The only variable in the loop head is `gap`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `even` list. Since `even` is described as a non-empty list of even numbers greater than 0 with at least one more element, the loop can execute again if there is another element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `gap` took the value of the last processed element from the `even` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `gap` should take the value of the next element in the `even` list.

Therefore, we need to update `gap` to the next element in the `even` list. The states of `y` and `ans` remain unchanged as per the problem description.

State: **`even` is a non-empty list of even numbers greater than 0 with at least one more element, `gap` is the next element in the `even` list, `y` is either `-gap // 2` or `y - gap // 2` depending on the condition, `ans` is `ans + gap`**
