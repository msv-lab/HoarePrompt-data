The code `ans += 2 * y` modifies the value of `ans` by adding twice the value of `y` to it. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `y` or `ans`, we can only express the new value of `ans` in terms of these variables.

Given that `even` is a non-empty list of even numbers greater than 0 with at least one more element, this condition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`even` is a non-empty list of even numbers greater than 0 with at least one more element; `y` is unknown; `ans` is updated to `ans + 2 * y`.**
