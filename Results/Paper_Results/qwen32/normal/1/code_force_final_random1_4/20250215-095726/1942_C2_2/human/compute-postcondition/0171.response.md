The given code snippet modifies the variable `ans` by adding `2 * y` to its current value. No other variables are altered by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `ans` is updated to `ans + 2 * y`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`2x - 2` remains unchanged, `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd and must contain at least one element, `even` contains all gaps greater than 0 and even (now sorted), `n` remains the first value provided in the input, `x` remains the second value provided in the input, `t` is decremented by `x`, `a` remains a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`, `st` remains a set containing unique elements from the modified list `a`, `y` is now `y - gap // 2`, `gap` is `gap_next`, `ans` is now `ans + 2 * y`.**
