Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: 2x - 2 remains unchanged, `n` is the first value provided in the input, `x` is the second value provided in the input and must be greater than 0, `t` is `t + x`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, each decreased by 1, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the modified list `a`, `odd` is a sorted list containing all odd gaps greater than 1 found during the iterations, `even` is a sorted list containing all even gaps greater than 0 found during the iterations, `i` is `x`, `ans` is the accumulated sum of `gap` values processed plus any adjustments due to `2 * y` if the loop broke, and `y` is the remaining value after all decrements or 0 if the loop broke.
Code of the loop:
for gap in even:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `even` is a non-empty list of even numbers greater than 0. If `y` was less than `gap // 2`, then `y` is 0, `ans` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y` is `y - gap // 2` and `ans` is `ans + gap`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `even` is a non-empty list of even numbers greater than 0 with at least one more element. If `y` was less than `gap // 2`, then `y` is now `-gap // 2` and `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `y` is now `y - gap // 2` and `ans` remains unchanged. `ans` is now `ans + gap`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `even` is a non-empty list of even numbers greater than 0 with at least one more element, `gap` is the next element in the `even` list, `y` is `y - gap // 2` if `y >= gap // 2`, otherwise `y` remains 0, `ans` is increased by `gap`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
