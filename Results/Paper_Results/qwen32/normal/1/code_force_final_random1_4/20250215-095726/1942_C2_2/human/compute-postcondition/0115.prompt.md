Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than 0, `a` is the newly input sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is calculated as `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list, `y` is updated based on the decrement operations, `ii` is incremented by 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tt` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 1; `i` is initially set to `len(a)`; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is equal to 2, then `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + 1`. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` contains the element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `y` is updated to `y - (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 + 1`, and `ii` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no updates occur to `ans`, `tmp`, `y`, or `ii`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tt` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 1; `i` is `len(a) - 1`; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is equal to 2, then `ans` is updated to `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is updated by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to it, `tmp` contains the element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `y` is updated accordingly, and `ii` is incremented by 1. If neither condition is met, no updates occur to `ans`, `tmp`, `y`, or `ii`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tt` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 1; `i` is 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, `ans` is updated by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to its previous value, `tmp` contains an additional element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is decreased by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2) - 1`. If neither condition is met, no updates occur to `ans`, `tmp`, `y`, or `ii`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
