### Reasoning:

Let's break down the code and verify if it correctly implements the problem statement.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Reading Input**: The function reads the dimensions of the field, the field itself, and the initial positions of all entities.
- **Processing Commands**: For each command, it updates the positions of entities and handles catching and throwing the Quaffle.
- **Scoring Goals**: When the Quaffle is thrown into a goal, it checks if it's the correct goal and updates the score accordingly.
- **Printing Events**: It prints the events of scoring goals and the final score at the end.

#### Function `goalIn`:
- **Checking Goal Positions**: This function checks if a given position is a goal for either team and returns the corresponding team index (0 for red, 1 for blue).

#### Function `isPlayer`:
- **Identifying Players**: This function checks if a given entity identifier corresponds to a player (not a goal or the Quaffle).

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Handling of `elements` Dictionary**:
   - In the `func_1` function, the `elements` dictionary is initialized with `{'B': (-1, -1)}` which seems incorrect. It should be initialized as an empty dictionary `{}`.
   - The `elements` dictionary should map entity identifiers to their positions on the grid.

2. **Incorrect Handling of `goal` List**:
   - The `goal` list is initialized as `[[], []]`, but it should be initialized as `[set(), set()]` to efficiently check if a position is a goal using the `in` operator.

3. **Incorrect Implementation of `isPlayer`**:
   - The `isPlayer` function should return `False` if the second character is 'G', but the current implementation always returns `True`.

4. **Incorrect Handling of `goalIn`**:
   - The `goalIn` function should check membership in sets, but the `goal` variable is a list of lists, not sets. This would lead to inefficient lookups.

5. **Incorrect Command Parsing**:
   - The command parsing logic in `func_1` is incorrect. It should handle commands like `C` and `T` properly, but the current implementation does not correctly handle these commands.

6. **Incorrect Movement Logic**:
   - The movement logic in `func_1` is incomplete and does not correctly update the grid or handle the Quaffle's position when thrown.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correctly implemented according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
