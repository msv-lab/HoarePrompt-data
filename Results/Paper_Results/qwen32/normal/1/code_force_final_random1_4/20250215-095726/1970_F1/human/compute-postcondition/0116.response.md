Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a `line` list read from the input; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in the input. If `el` equals '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `allPlayers` remains unchanged. `goal` is a list of two lists, where each list contains tuples of positions of goals for the blue and red teams respectively, and if `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, ind)` where `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind]` is 'BG', otherwise `tmp` is 1. `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points[0]` being the score of the Red team and `points[1]` being the score of the Blue team, and if `el` is equal to '.S', one of these scores has been increased by 10. `t` must be greater than 0; `command` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the standard input; the length of `command` is 3; `obj` is the first element of `command`; `com` is the second element of `command`; `el` is the third element of `command`. Additionally, if `el` is equal to '.S', `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.**
