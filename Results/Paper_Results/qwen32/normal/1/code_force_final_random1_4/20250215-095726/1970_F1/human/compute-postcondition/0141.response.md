Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a `line` list read from the input; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in the input. If the length of `command` is 3, `obj` is the first element of `command`; `com` is the second element of `command`; `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` equals '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. If `el` is equal to '.S', one of the scores in `points` has been increased by 10, and `team` is determined based on whether `obj[0]` is 'B' (Blue team) or not (Red team). If the length of `command` is not 3, `obj` is the first element of `command` and `obj` is equal to '.B'; `com` is the second element of `command`; `pos` is the position of `obj` in the grid as retrieved from `elements[obj]`; `nxt` is the new position calculated based on `com`. If `obj` is not a player or if `obj` is a player and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is not a player, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt` unless `elements['.B']` equals `nxt`. If `pos` is a goal position, `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True` and the corresponding team's score in `points` is increased by 1.**
