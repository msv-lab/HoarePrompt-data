To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and how they contribute to the output:

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `time`: This is an integer that gets incremented by 1 each time this part of the code is reached.
   - `player`: This is determined by the function `isPlayer(obj)`. If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, then `player` is set to `obj`. Otherwise, `player` is set to the element at the new position `nxt` on the `grid`.

2. **Position Calculation:**
   - `pos`: This is the current position of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary.
   - `nxt`: This is the new position calculated based on the command `com`. It is derived from `pos` by adding the movement vector specified by `mov[com]`.

3. **Command Parsing:**
   - `command`: This is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the input.
   - `obj`: This is the first element of `command`.
   - `com`: This is the second element of `command`.

Given these points, the `print` statement will output:
- The current `time`.
- The `player` which could either be `obj` (if `obj` is a player) or the element at the new position `nxt` on the `grid`.

Since the exact values of `time`, `obj`, `com`, and the grid configuration are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **[time] [player] ELIMINATED (where [time] is the current time and [player] is either [obj] if [obj] is a player, or the element at the new position [nxt] on the grid)**
