The given code appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Here's the breakdown:

- `tmp` is determined based on the value of `line[ind]`: `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind]` is 'BG', otherwise `tmp` is 1.
- The tuple `(i, ind)` represents the position of a goal on the grid.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `goal[tmp]`, which now includes the new tuple `(i, ind)`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the `line` list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in `line`, with `elements[line[ind]]` updated to `(i, ind)`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` for all player entities in `line`; `goal` is a list of two lists, where each list contains tuples of positions of goals for the blue and red teams respectively, and `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(i, ind)`; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `line` is a list of strings with at least one element; `ind` is 0; `line[ind]` is not '..'; `line[ind]` is not a player; the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G'; `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind]` is 'BG', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**
