To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and the context:

1. **Variables and Their Meanings:**
   - `time`: This variable represents the current time in the game. Its exact value isn't specified, but it is an integer.
   - `GoalName`: This is a list (or dictionary) that maps team indices (0 for blue, 1 for red) to the names of the goals. For example, `GoalName[0]` might be "Blue Goal" and `GoalName[1]` might be "Red Goal".
   - `team`: This variable indicates the team whose goal was scored. It is either 0 (blue team) or 1 (red team).
   
2. **Context:**
   - The `print` statement is executed after a player reaches a goal position (`pos`), and `team` is determined based on which goal list (`goal[0]` for blue or `goal[1]` for red) contains the `pos`.
   - The `time` variable presumably keeps track of the elapsed time in the game.

Given this information, the `print` statement formats the output to show the current `time`, the name of the goal scored by the respective `team`, and the word "GOAL".

### Explanation of the Output:
- `%d %s GOAL`: This format string specifies that the output will consist of:
  - `%d`: An integer (the `time`).
  - `%s`: A string (the name of the goal, `GoalName[team]`).
  - `GOAL`: A literal string.

### Final Output:
Based on the above breakdown, the output will be a formatted string showing the current `time`, the name of the goal scored by the respective `team`, and the word "GOAL". Since the exact values of `time` and `GoalName[team]` are not provided, we can only describe them in terms of their roles.

Output: **[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where [time] is the current time in the game and [GoalName[team]] is the name of the goal scored by the team)**
