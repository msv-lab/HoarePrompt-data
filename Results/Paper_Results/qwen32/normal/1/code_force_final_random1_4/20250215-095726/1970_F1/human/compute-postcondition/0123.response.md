To determine what will be printed by the statement `print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))`, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state:

1. **time**: This variable represents the current time in the context of the game. Since it's not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can assume it holds some integer value representing the current turn or time step in the game.

2. **player**: This variable is determined based on the following logic:
   - If `obj` is a player, then `player` is set to `obj`.
   - Otherwise, `player` is set to the entity at the new position `nxt` in the grid, i.e., `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

Given this, the `print` statement will output the current time followed by the identifier of the player who is eliminated, along with the word "ELIMINATED".

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
- **time**: This is an integer representing the current time/turn in the game.
- **obj**: This is the first element of the `command` list, which likely represents the entity (player or object) that is performing an action.
- **player**: This is either `obj` if `obj` is a player, or the entity found at the new position `nxt` in the grid.

### Output Description:
The output will be a formatted string that includes the current time (`time`), the identifier of the player or object that is being eliminated (`player`), and the word "ELIMINATED".

Since the exact values of `time` and `player` depend on the specific state of the game at the point where the print statement is executed, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **[time] [player] ELIMINATED (where [time] is the current time/turn in the game and [player] is the identifier of the player or object that is being eliminated)**
