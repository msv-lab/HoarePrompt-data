Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing three elements, all of which are the `line` list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in `line`, with `elements[line[ind]]` updated to `(i, ind)` for all `ind` where `line[ind]` is not '..', and now `elements[line[1]]` is `(i, 1)`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` for all player entities in `line`, and if `line[1]` is a player, `allPlayers[line[1]]` is `False`; `goal` is a list of two lists, where each list contains tuples of positions of goals for the blue and red teams respectively, and if `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, ind)` where `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind]` is 'BG', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `line` is a list of strings obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `ind` is 1; `i` is the next integer after the previous value of `i`. If `line[1]` is a player, `allPlayers[line[1]]` is set to `False`. If `line[1]` is not a player and `line[1][1]` is 'G', `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, 1)` where `tmp` is 0 if `line[1]` is 'BG', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**
