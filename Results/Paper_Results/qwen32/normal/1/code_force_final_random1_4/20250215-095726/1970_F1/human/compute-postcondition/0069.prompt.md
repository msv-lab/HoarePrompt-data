Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the `line` list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in `line`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` for all player entities in `line`; `goal` is a list of two lists, where each list contains tuples of positions of goals for the blue and red teams respectively; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `i` is 1; `line` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a newly read line from the input.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the `line` list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in `line`, with `elements[line[ind]]` updated to `(i, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not '..'; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` for all player entities in `line`; `goal` is a list of two lists, where each list contains tuples of positions of goals for the blue and red teams respectively, and if `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, ind)` where `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind]` is 'BG', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `line` is a list of strings with at least one element; `ind` is 0. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is a player entity, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. If `line[ind]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', the corresponding goal list is updated with the position `(i, ind)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the `line` list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in `line`, with `elements[line[1]]` updated to `(i, 1)` if `line[1]` is not '..'; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[1]] = False` if `line[1]` is a player entity; `goal` is a list of two lists, where each list contains tuples of positions of goals for the blue and red teams respectively, and if `line[1]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, 1)` where `tmp` is 0 if `line[1]` is 'BG', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `line` is a list of strings with at least one element; `ind` is 1. If `line[1]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[1]]` is set to `False`. If `line[1]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, 1)` where `tmp` is determined by the first character of `line[1]` being 'B' (for blue) or not (for red). If `line[1]` is '..', none of the dictionaries or lists are updated.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the `line` list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including all non-'..' elements in `line`, with `elements[line[1]]` updated to `(i, 1)` if `line[1]` is not '..', and `elements[line[2]]` updated to `(i, 2)` if `line[2]` is not '..'; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[1]] = False` if `line[1]` is a player entity and `allPlayers[line[2]] = False` if `line[2]` is a player entity; `goal` is a list of two lists, where each list contains tuples of positions of goals for the blue and red teams respectively, and if `line[1]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, 1)` where `tmp` is 0 if `line[1]` is 'BG', otherwise `tmp` is 1; if `line[2]` is not a player and its second character is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` includes the tuple `(i, 2)` where `tmp` is 0 if `line[2]` is 'BG', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `line` is a list of strings with at least one element; `ind` is 2. If `line[2]` is not '..', `elements[line[2]]` is updated to `(i, 2)` and if `line[2]` is a goal ('BG' or 'RG'), it is added to the corresponding team's goal list in `goal`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
