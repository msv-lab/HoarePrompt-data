Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element, which is the `line` list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, including `line[1]: (0, 1)` if `line[1]` is not equal to '..', and now also includes `line[2]: (0, 2)`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary with `allPlayers[line[1]] = False` if `isPlayer(line[1])` is True and `line[1]` is not equal to '..', and `allPlayers[line[2]] = False` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True and `line[ind]` is not equal to '..'; `goal` is a list of two lists, where one of them contains the tuple `(0, 1)` if the second character of `line[1]` is 'G' and `line[1]` is not equal to '..', and if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal` includes `(0, 2)` in the same sublist as `(0, 1)` depending on whether `line[ind][0]` is 'B' or not; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `i` is 0; `line` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the input and must have at least one element; `ind` is 2; `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` is 'B' and `line[1]` is not equal to '..', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is False, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**
