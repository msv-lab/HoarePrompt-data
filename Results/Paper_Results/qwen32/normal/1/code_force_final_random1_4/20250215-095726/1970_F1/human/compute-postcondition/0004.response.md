Output State: **`n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is an empty list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid with `elements = {'.B': (-1, -1)}`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary (now empty); `goal` is a list of two empty lists; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively.**

Explanation: The code initializes the `goal` variable to be a list containing two empty lists. All other variables remain unchanged.
