Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is a list containing one element, which is the `line` list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid with `elements = {'.B': (-1, -1), line[ind]: (i, ind)}`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary (now empty); `goal` is a list of two lists, where one of them contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the second character of the current element at index `ind` in `line` is 'G'; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams respectively, with `points = [0, 0]`; `i` is 0; `line` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from the input and must have at least one element; the current element at index `ind` in `line` is not equal to '..' and is not a player; `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1 if the second character of the current element at index `ind` in `line` is 'G'.**
