Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31 and `a` must have at least one element; `res` is 0; `count` is an empty dictionary. Additionally, `num` is not in `count`.**
