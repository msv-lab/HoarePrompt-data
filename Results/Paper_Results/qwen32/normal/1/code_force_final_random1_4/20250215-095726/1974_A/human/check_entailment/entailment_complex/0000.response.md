Let's analyze the logic of the provided code to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
- We need to determine the minimum number of 5x3 grids (screens) required to fit `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons.
- Each 5x3 grid can hold up to 15 1x1 icons or a combination of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

### Analysis of the Code
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens:**
   - The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`. This seems to be an attempt to calculate the minimum number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. However, this formula is not correct because it does not account for the fact that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the placement of these icons needs to be considered carefully.
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This calculation is not meaningful in the context of determining the number of screens.
   - The `if` condition checks if `m < a` (which is the total number of test cases). This condition is irrelevant to the problem and does not contribute to the correct calculation of the number of screens.
   - If the condition is true, `z` is recalculated using a formula that doesn't make sense in this context.

### Correct Approach
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Place all 2x2 icons first, since they occupy more space.
2. Calculate how many 5x3 grids are needed to fit all 2x2 icons.
3. Place the remaining 1x1 icons in the available space.

### Correct Implementation
Here is a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (y + 2) // 3  # Each screen can fit at most 3 2x2 icons
        
        # Calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4
        
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_1x1 = (x - remaining_cells + 14) // 15 if x > remaining_cells else 0
        
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
        
        print(total_screens)

func()
```

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the original code does not correctly compute the minimum number of screens required. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
