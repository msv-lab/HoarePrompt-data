The value of `m` is calculated using the formula `15 * z - y * 4`. Given that `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, we substitute `z` into the formula to get `m = 15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`.

The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged. The only change is the assignment of `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are the integers read from the input, `a` must be greater than 0, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`.**
