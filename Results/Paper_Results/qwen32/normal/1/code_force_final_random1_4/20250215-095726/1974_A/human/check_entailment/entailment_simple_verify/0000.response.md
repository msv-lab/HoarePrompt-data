### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons.
- Each screen is 5x3, which means it has 15 cells.
- A 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells.
- The goal is to minimize the number of screens used.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)
```

#### Annotated Code:
```python
#State of the program right before the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, there are two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        
        print(z)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the number of iterations which is greater than 0, `i` equals `a`, `x` and `y` are the integers from the last iteration, `z` is the value computed in the last iteration, and `m` is the value of `m` computed in the last iteration.
```

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons (`z`)**:
   - The calculation `z = (y + 1) // 2` is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that placing 2x2 icons optimally might require fewer screens than this formula suggests.
   - For example, if `y = 2`, the formula gives `z = (2 + 1) // 2 = 1`, but we can actually fit both 2x2 icons on one screen.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Cells (`m`)**:
   - The calculation `m = 15 * z - y * 4` seems intended to calculate remaining cells after placing `y` 2x2 icons, but it is not correctly used.
   - The condition `if m < a:` is nonsensical because `a` is the number of test cases, not related to the remaining cells or screens.

3. **Incorrect Placement of 1x1 Icons**:
   - The line `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` is attempting to place 1x1 icons, but it is incorrectly using `m` and does not consider the optimal placement of 1x1 icons around 2x2 icons.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Calculate the minimum number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons optimally.
2. Calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. Place the 1x1 icons in the remaining cells, considering the optimal arrangement.

### Correct Implementation:
A correct implementation would look something like this:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the minimum number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        z = (y + 2) // 3  # Each screen can hold at most 3 2x2 icons optimally
        # Calculate remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = 15 * z - y * 4
        # Place 1x1 icons in the remaining cells
        if remaining_cells < x:
            z += (x - remaining_cells + 14) // 15  # Add additional screens if needed
        print(z)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified and the need for a correct approach, the provided program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
