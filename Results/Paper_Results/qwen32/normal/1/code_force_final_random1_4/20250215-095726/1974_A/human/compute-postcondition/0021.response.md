Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is greater than 0, `z` is \((y + 1) // 2\) if `m` is not less than `a`, and `z` is \(\left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{2x - 7y + 13}{30}\right)\) if `m` is less than `a`. `m` is \(15 * \left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right) - y * 4\), and `i` remains 4.**
