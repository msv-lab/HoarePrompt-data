The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This means that the values of `x` and `y` will be updated based on the input, while the other variables (`t`, `a`, `z`, `m`, and `i`) remain unchanged unless further operations are performed on them.

Given the initial state, the only variables affected by the code snippet are `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is greater than 0, `z` is \((y + 1) // 2\) if `m` is not less than `a`, otherwise `z` is \(\left(\frac{4y + x + 14}{15}\right)\), `m` is \(15 * \left(\frac{y + 1}{2}\right) - y * 4\), and `i` is 4.**
