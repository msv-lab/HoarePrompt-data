### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to verify if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing one coin.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- Both players play optimally.
- The winner is determined by the parity of the total number of coins (`a + b`).

#### Key Insight:
- If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob wins.
- If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is odd, Alice wins.

This insight is derived from the fact that each move reduces the total number of coins by 1, thereby changing its parity. If the total starts as even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position (where the total is odd when it's Alice's turn). Conversely, if the total starts as odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position (where the total is even when it's Bob's turn).

#### Program Analysis:
- **func_1(a, b)**: This function checks the parity of the total number of coins (`a + b`). If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'; otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.
- **func_2()**: This function handles input/output operations. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case using `func_1`, and stores the results. Finally, it prints the results.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of `a + b`.
- The annotations also confirm that `func_2` correctly reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.

Given the above analysis, the logic implemented in the program aligns perfectly with the problem requirements. The original assessment correctly identifies that the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is indeed **True**.

Final: **True**
