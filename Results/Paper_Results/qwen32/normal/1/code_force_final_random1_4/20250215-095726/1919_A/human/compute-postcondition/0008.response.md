The code snippet reassigns the variable `winner` to the return value of the function `func_1(a, b)`. Since the function call does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, or `t`, these remain unchanged. The list `results` initially contains the value of `winner`, but since `winner` is reassigned, the list `results` will now contain the new value returned by `func_1(a, b)`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `results` is a list containing the value of `winner` which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `t` must be greater than 0.**
