Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each of which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration; `t` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `results` is a list containing at least one element, which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration; `t` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `results` is a list containing at least two elements, which includes the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration; `t` is 1; `result` is the next element in `results`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `results` is a list containing at least three elements, which includes the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration and at least one more element; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration; `t` is 1; `result` is the next element in `results`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
