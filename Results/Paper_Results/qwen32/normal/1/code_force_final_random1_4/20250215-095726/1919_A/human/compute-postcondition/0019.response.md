The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If there are more elements in the `results` list, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `result` is the next element in `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least one more element after the current `result`.

Since `result` is the current element being processed in the loop, at the start of the next iteration, `result` should be the next element in the `results` list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `results` is a list containing at least three elements, which includes the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration and at least one more element; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration; `t` is 1; `result` is the next element in `results`**
