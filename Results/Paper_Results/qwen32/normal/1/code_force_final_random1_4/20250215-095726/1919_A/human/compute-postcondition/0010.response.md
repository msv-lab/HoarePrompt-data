The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used just for iteration, it doesn't hold any specific state that needs to be preserved or adjusted.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 (since each iteration reduces `t` by 1). Therefore, if `t` was greater than 0 at the end of the last iteration, it should now be `t - 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`**
