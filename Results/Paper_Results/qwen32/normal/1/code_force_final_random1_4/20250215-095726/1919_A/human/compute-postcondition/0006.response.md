The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (which is a common placeholder for a loop variable when its value is not used) and `t` (the number of iterations). Since `_` does not affect the continuation of the loop, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have decremented `t` by 1 if it were part of a typical countdown loop. However, since the loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, the loop control variable `_` is automatically managed by Python's `range` function, and `t` itself does not change within the loop. Instead, the loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0 when the loop starts.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively; `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `t` must be greater than 0**
