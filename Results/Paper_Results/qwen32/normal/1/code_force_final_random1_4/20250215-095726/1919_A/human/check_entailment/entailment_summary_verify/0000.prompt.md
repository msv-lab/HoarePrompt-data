You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 1
    
    1 4
    
    5 3
    
    4 5

    839204 7281
    
    1000000000 1000000000
    
    53110 2024

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads two integers representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have. It then determines the winner based on some criteria defined in `func_1` and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the result for each one.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns playing a game with their wallets.
- Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
- Each player must remove 1 coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- Both players play optimally.

### Key Observations:
- The game revolves around the parity (odd/even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).
- If `a + b` is even, Bob wins.
- If `a + b` is odd, Alice wins.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The function `func_1(a, b)` determines the winner based on the parity of `a + b`.
- The function `func_2()` handles multiple test cases and prints the result for each.

### Code Review:
- The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly checks if `a + b` is even or odd and returns "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly.
- The function `func_2()` correctly reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and prints the results.

### Testing Potential Cases:
Let's consider a few test cases to ensure the program works as expected:

1. **Test Case 1**: `a = 1`, `b = 1`
   - `a + b = 2` (even), Expected Output: "Bob"
   - Actual Output: "Bob"

2. **Test Case 2**: `a = 1`, `b = 4`
   - `a + b = 5` (odd), Expected Output: "Alice"
   - Actual Output: "Alice"

3. **Test Case 3**: `a = 5`, `b = 3`
   - `a + b = 8` (even), Expected Output: "Bob"
   - Actual Output: "Bob"

4. **Test Case 4**: `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
   - `a + b = 2000000000` (even), Expected Output: "Bob"
   - Actual Output: "Bob"

5. **Test Case 5**: `a = 53110`, `b = 2024`
   - `a + b = 55134` (even), Expected Output: "Bob"
   - Actual Output: "Bob"

All these test cases match the expected outcomes based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and testing of various cases, the program appears to be correct. It accurately determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins in both players' wallets.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It handles multiple test cases and provides the correct output for each scenario.
