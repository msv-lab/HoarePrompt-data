Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `winner` to the `results` list. Since `winner` is already an element in `results`, after appending, `results` contains two identical elements, both being the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged.
