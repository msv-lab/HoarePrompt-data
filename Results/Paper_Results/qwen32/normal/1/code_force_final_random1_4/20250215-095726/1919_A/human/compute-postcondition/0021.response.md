To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior and the state changes within the loop. The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list and prints each element. The key variables here are `results`, `winner`, and `t`.

From the given information:
- `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each of which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`.
- `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration.
- `t` is the number of iterations the loop will perform, which is also the length of the `results` list.

After the loop has executed all its iterations, the following will be true:
- All elements in the `results` list will have been printed.
- `results` will still contain the same elements as it did before the loop started (since the loop only reads from `results` and does not modify it).
- `winner` will still hold the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration (since the loop does not change `winner`).
- `t` will still be the same as it was before the loop started (since the loop does not change `t`).

Therefore, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each of which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration; `t` is the number of iterations the loop performed.**

In simpler terms, the final state remains the same as the initial state with respect to the variables `a`, `b`, `results`, `winner`, and `t`. The only difference is that all elements in `results` have been printed during the loop's execution.
