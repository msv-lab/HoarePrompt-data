To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic behind the solution and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who start with `a` and `b` coins respectively. They take turns swapping wallets and removing one coin until one of them can't make a move. The key point here is that the game state is determined by the total number of coins (`a + b`). If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

### Explanation of the Program:
- **func_1(a, b)**: This function determines the winner based on the sum of coins `a + b`. If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob', otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.
- **func_2()**: This function handles the input/output operations. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case using `func_1`, and stores the results. Finally, it prints the results.

### Reasoning:
The core logic of the game is captured correctly in `func_1`. The game can be analyzed as a combinatorial game where the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins determines the winner. If the total number of coins is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position, and vice versa. This is because each move reduces the total number of coins by 1, changing its parity. Therefore, if the initial total is even, Bob can ensure that he is the one to face an odd total when it's Alice's turn, and eventually win. Similarly, if the initial total is odd, Alice can ensure she faces an even total when it's Bob's turn, and eventually win.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
