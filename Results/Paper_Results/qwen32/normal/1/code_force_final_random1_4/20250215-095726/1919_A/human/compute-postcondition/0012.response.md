Output State: **`a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `winner` is updated to the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. The values of `a`, `b`, `results`, and `t` remain unchanged except for `winner` and `t`. Since `t` was initially greater than 0, after decrementing by 1, it remains greater than 0. The `results` list still contains two elements, each being the return value of `func_1(a, b)`.
