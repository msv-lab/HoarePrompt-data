To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1(a, b)` does. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we can only infer that `winner` will be assigned the value returned by `func_1(a, b)`. 

Given that the initial state specifies `a` and `b` as integers and `results` as an empty list, and since no other variables are modified or used in the given code snippet, we can only conclude that `winner` will hold the return value of `func_1(a, b)`.

Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `winner` along with the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `results`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively; `results` is an empty list; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**.
