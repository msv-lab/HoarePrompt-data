The code snippet reads two integers from the input, which represent the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means that the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the input.

The variables `results`, `winner`, and `t` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`; `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)`; `t` must be greater than 0.**
