To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_1` correctly determines the winner of the game based on the provided rules and examples.

### Analysis:

The game revolves around the total number of coins (a + b) and the parity (odd/even nature) of that sum. Here's the reasoning:

- If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, the player who starts (Alice) will always be able to force a situation where the other player (Bob) ends up with no moves. This is because each turn reduces the total number of coins by one, and starting from an even number, the player who starts can always leave an odd number for the opponent, and vice versa. Eventually, Bob will be left with the last coin, and Alice will win.
  
- Conversely, if the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and force Alice into a losing position. Starting from an odd number, Alice will leave an even number for Bob after her first move, and Bob can continue to mirror Alice's moves until Alice is left with the last coin, making Bob the winner.

Thus, the correct strategy is determined by the parity of the sum of the coins:
- If (a + b) is even, Bob wins.
- If (a + b) is odd, Alice wins.

### Conclusion:

The logic in `func_1` correctly implements this strategy. It checks if the sum of the coins is even or odd and returns 'Bob' or 'Alice' accordingly. Therefore, the program is correct.
