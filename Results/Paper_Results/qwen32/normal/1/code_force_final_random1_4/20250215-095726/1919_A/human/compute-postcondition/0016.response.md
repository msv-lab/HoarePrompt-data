Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `results` is a list containing at least one element, which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`.
- `winner` holds the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration.
- `t` is set to 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print(result)
```

However, there is a discrepancy in the variable names mentioned in the initial state and the print statement. Specifically, the variable `result` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. It seems like there might be a typo, and the intended variable to be printed could be either `results` or `winner`.

Given the information, let's assume the intention was to print `results` since it is mentioned first and contains at least one element, which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`.

### Explanation:
- `results` is a list that contains at least one element, which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`.
- Since no further iterations or modifications to `results` are mentioned, we can assume that `results` still contains only the first return value of `func_1(a, b)`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the contents of the `results` list.

### Output:
Output: **[return_value_of_func_1(a, b)] (where return_value_of_func_1(a, b) is the return value of the function func_1 called with arguments a and b)**
