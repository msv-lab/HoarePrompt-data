To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the code and the initial state:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. This variable represents the number of test cases but does not directly influence the current print statement.
- `n` is an input integer, representing the number of elements in the list `nums`.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
```

Let's analyze this line of code step-by-step:

1. `nums[:-1]` creates a slice of the list `nums` that includes all elements except the last one.
2. `max(nums[:-1])` finds the maximum value in this sliced list.
3. `nums[-1]` accesses the last element of the list `nums`.
4. The expression `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]` adds the maximum value from the first part of the list to the last element of the list.

Given the initial state, we do not have the specific values of `nums`, but we can describe the output in terms of these values.

Output: **the maximum value of the first n-1 elements of the list `nums` plus the last element of the list `nums` (where `nums` is the list of integers obtained from the input)**.
