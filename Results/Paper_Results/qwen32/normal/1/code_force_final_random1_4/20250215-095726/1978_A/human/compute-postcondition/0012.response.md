To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `t` is decreased by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. However, `t` does not appear in the print statement, so it is irrelevant to the current output.
- `n` is an input integer. While `n` is mentioned, it is not directly used in the print statement.
- `nums` is a new list of integers obtained from the latest input.

The print statement is:
```python
print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
```

Let's analyze the components of this statement:

1. `nums[:-1]`: This represents all elements of the list `nums` except the last one.
2. `max(nums[:-1])`: This computes the maximum value among all elements of `nums` except the last one.
3. `nums[-1]`: This is the last element of the list `nums`.
4. `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]`: This adds the maximum value from the first part of the list to the last element of the list.

Given that `nums` is a list of integers, the output will be the sum of the maximum value from all elements except the last one and the last element itself.

Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical output. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1] (where max(nums[:-1]) is the maximum value of all elements in nums except the last one, and nums[-1] is the last element of nums)**
