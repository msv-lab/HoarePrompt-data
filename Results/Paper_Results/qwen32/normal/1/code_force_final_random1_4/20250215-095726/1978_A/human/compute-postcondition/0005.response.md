The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use) and `t`. Since `_` does not affect the loop condition, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was decremented by 1 because the loop iterates `t` times. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

Given that `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, at the start of the current iteration, `t` would have been 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, if at the end of the previous iteration `t` was some value `x`, then at the start of the current iteration `t` would be `x + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `t` at the end of the previous iteration, we can say that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input**. 

However, to be precise about the state transition:
If at the end of the previous iteration `t` was `x`, then at the start of the current iteration `t` should be `x + 1`.

Since we need to reflect the state right before the decrement happens in the loop, we keep `t` as it is from the end of the previous iteration but acknowledge that for the loop to continue, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input**. 

To explicitly show the transition:
If at the end of the previous iteration `t` was `x`, then at the start of the current iteration `t` is `x` (but we know `x` must be at least 1 for the loop to continue).

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input**. 

Since the decrement happens inside the loop, the state right before the loop starts the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input**. 

But to reflect the exact state before the decrement in the loop:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input**. 

Since `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to continue, we can say:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input**.

To be explicit about the transition:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input**.

So the final state before the loop starts the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input**.

Since `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to continue, we can say:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input**.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input**.

But to reflect the exact state before the decrement in the loop:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input**.

So the final state before the loop starts the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input**.

Since `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to continue, we can say:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input**.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input**.
