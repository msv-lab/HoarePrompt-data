The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code will take an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that `n` is already an input integer, but this line will overwrite the previous value of `n` with the new input value.

Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 500, and `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, these variables remain unchanged by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
