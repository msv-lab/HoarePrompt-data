The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or the conditions outside of the loop. Since there is no loop explicitly mentioned in the given context, the `continue` statement here would typically be part of a loop structure that is not shown.

However, since the `continue` statement alone does not change any variable values or conditions, the state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where the first `n-2` elements are `0` and the last two elements are decremented by the respective `opNum` values, `stop` is True**.
