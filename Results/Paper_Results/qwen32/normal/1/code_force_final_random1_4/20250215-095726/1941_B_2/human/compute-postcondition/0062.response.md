Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `numTest` is `numTest - 1`
- `n` is at least 3
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` now being 0, `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged, `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged
- `stop` is True if `a[i]` (which was originally less than 0) is less than 0; otherwise, `stop` remains False
- `opNum` is 0
- `i` is incremented by 1
- If `a[i]` is less than 0, the loop or if statement is broken out of

Code Snippet:
```python
a[i] -= opNum
```

Since `opNum` is 0, subtracting `opNum` from `a[i]` does not change the value of `a[i]`. Therefore, `a[i]` remains 0.

No other variables are affected by this operation. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` now being 0, `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged, `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged, `stop` is True if `a[i]` (which was originally less than 0) is less than 0; otherwise, `stop` remains False, `opNum` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is less than 0, the loop or if statement is broken out of.**
