The code snippet `a[i] -= opNum` modifies the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a` by subtracting `opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is set to `a[i]`, this operation effectively sets `a[i]` to `a[i] - a[i]`, which results in `a[i]` being 0.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` now being 0, `stop` is True if the current element `a[i]` (which was originally less than 0) is less than 0; otherwise, `stop` remains False, `opNum` is `a[i]` (which was the original value before the operation).**
