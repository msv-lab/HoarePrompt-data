The code assigns the value of `a[i]` to `opNum`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `stop` is True if the current element `a[i]` is less than 0; otherwise, `stop` remains False, `opNum` is `a[i]`.**
