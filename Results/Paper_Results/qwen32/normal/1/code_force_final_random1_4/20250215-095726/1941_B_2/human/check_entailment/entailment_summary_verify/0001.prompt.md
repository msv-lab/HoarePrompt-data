You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `b` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the first element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second element plus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second-to-last element plus 2. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine whether we can reduce all elements of an array to zero using a specific operation. The operation allows us to select an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq n-1 \)) and perform the following changes:
- Decrease \( a_{i-1} \) by 1.
- Decrease \( a_i \) by 2.
- Decrease \( a_{i+1} \) by 1.

We need to check if it's possible to apply this operation any number of times to make all elements zero.

### Key Observations:
1. **Parity Check**: Since each operation decreases the total sum of the array by 4, the total sum of the array must be divisible by 4 for it to be possible to reduce it to zero.
2. **Boundary Conditions**: The first and last elements play a special role because they do not have both neighbors to interact with. Specifically, the first element can only be reduced by the operation affecting the second element, and similarly, the last element can only be reduced by the operation affecting the second-to-last element.
3. **Specific Constraints**: If the first element is odd, the second element must be exactly 2 more than the first element to allow the first element to be reduced to zero through the operation. Similarly, if the last element is odd, the second-to-last element must be exactly 2 more than the last element.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks the following conditions:
- If the first element is odd and the second element is not exactly 2 more than the first element, it prints "NO".
- If the last element is odd and the second-to-last element is not exactly 2 more than the last element, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

However, this logic is incomplete and incorrect because:
- It does not check if the total sum of the array is divisible by 4.
- It does not consider the possibility of reducing the middle elements to zero while ensuring the boundary conditions are met.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It fails to account for the total sum condition and does not fully ensure that the array can be reduced to zero under the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
