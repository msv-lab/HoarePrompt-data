The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `b`. This means that the original value of `b` (which was a list of integers) is overwritten with the new list derived from the input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `a` is the newly input integer
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input

After executing the code snippet:
- `b` is now a new list of integers obtained from the latest input.

The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is the newly input integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input.**
