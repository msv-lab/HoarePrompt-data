The code snippet assigns the value of `a[i]` to `opNum`. This means that `opNum` now holds the value that was originally stored in `a[i]` before any modifications were made to the elements of the list `a`.

Given the initial state, the value of `a[i]` is `-opNum` (as per the description of the list `a`). Therefore, after executing `opNum = a[i]`, `opNum` will be set to `-opNum`. This implies that `opNum` will become the negation of its current value.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is `numTest + 1`, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is `-opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`, and `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - 2 * opNum`, either `a[len(a) - 1]` is not 0 or `a[len(a) - 2]` is not 0, or both are 0, `opNum` is `-opNum`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i]` is less than 0, `stop` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
