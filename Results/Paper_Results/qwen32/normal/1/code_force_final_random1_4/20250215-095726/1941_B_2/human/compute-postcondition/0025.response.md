Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `i` is incremented by 1: This means that the variable `i` has been increased by 1 from its previous value. However, the exact value of `i` before this increment is not provided.
- `n` is greater than 2: This indicates that `n` holds a value that is more than 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'NO'`. The values of `i` and `n` do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement because it directly prints the string `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `i` and `n` and will always be `'NO'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
