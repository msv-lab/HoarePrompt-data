In this task, the initial state provides us with the following information:

- `stop` is set to `True`.
- `a` is a list of integers, and specifically, the last element (`a[len(a) - 1]`) and the second-to-last element (`a[len(a) - 2]`) are both 0.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement does not depend on the values of `stop`, `a`, or any other variables. It directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not require any additional computation or description of variable values.

Output: **YES**
