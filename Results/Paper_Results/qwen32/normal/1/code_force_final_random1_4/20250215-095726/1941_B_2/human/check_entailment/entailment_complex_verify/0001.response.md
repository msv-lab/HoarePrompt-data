### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program:

1. **Parity Check and Sum Divisibility**: The program does not check if the total sum of the array is divisible by 4. This is a fundamental requirement since each operation reduces the sum by 4. If the sum is not divisible by 4, it is impossible to reduce the array to all zeros.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: While the program correctly checks the conditions for the first and last elements, it does not ensure that these conditions alone are sufficient to make the entire array zero. There could be scenarios where the first and last elements meet the conditions, but the middle elements cannot be reduced to zero due to other constraints.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the provided program is incorrect. The program does not cover all necessary conditions to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
