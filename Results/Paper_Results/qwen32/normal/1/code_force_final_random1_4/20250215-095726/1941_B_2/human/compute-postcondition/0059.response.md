The `break` statement will terminate the current loop or iteration without affecting the values of the variables directly. Therefore, the values of `t`, `numTest`, `n`, `a`, `stop`, `opNum`, and `i` remain as they were before the `break` statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` now being 0, `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged, `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged, `stop` is True, `opNum` is `a[i]` (which was the original value before the operation), `i` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
