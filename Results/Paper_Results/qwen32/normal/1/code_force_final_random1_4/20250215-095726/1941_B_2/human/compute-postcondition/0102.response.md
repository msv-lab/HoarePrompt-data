Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is `numTest + 1`, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is 0, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`, and `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - opNum`, either `a[len(a) - 1]` is not 0 or `a[len(a) - 2]` is not 0, or both are 0, `opNum` is assigned the value of `a[i]` (which was the original value before the operation), `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` was less than 0 before the operation, `stop` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains False, `opNum` is now the value of `a[i]` before the operation.`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `opNum` is updated to the value of `a[i]` before any operations were performed on the list `a`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
