You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_j satisfies 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input. For each of these `t` executions, the program will have read an integer `a` and a list of integers `b`. It will have printed 'NO' if the first element of `b` is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2. Otherwise, it will have printed 'YES'. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` will be reset for each iteration but will not persist beyond the current iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. The logic in the program only checks if the first and last elements satisfy certain conditions, but it does not account for the entire array and the operations that can be performed on it.

Here is a counterexample where the program outputs "YES" but it should actually output "NO":

**Counterexample Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of Counterexample:**
- The array is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`.
- The first element `1` is odd, but the second element `2` is not `1 + 2`, so the condition `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2` is not met.
- The last element `1` is odd, but the second-to-last element `2` is not `1 + 2`, so the condition `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2` is not met.
- Since neither condition is met, the program outputs "YES".
- However, it is impossible to make all elements zero using the given operations because the middle element `3` cannot be reduced to zero without violating the constraints on the adjacent elements.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
