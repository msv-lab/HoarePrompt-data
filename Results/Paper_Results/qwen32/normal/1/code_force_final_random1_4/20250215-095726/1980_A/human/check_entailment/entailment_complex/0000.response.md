### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and verify if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Initialization**: The function `func_1` initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it extracts the values of `n`, `m`, and `a` from the `test_cases` list.

3. **Frequency Calculation**: It creates a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (for difficulties 'A' to 'G') and populates it by counting the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `a`.

4. **Calculate Missing Problems**: For each difficulty level, it calculates how many more problems are needed to meet the requirement of having at least `m` problems of each type. This is done using the expression `max(0, m - f)` for each frequency `f` in `freq`. The sum of these values gives the total number of additional problems needed for that test case.

5. **Store Result**: The calculated number of missing problems is appended to the `results` list.

6. **Return Results**: After processing all test cases, the function returns the `results` list.

### Analysis of the Example Provided:

Let's check the function against the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `n=10`, `m=1`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`
  - Frequencies: `B=2`, `G=2`, `E=2`, `C=2`, `D=2`
  - Missing: `A=1`, `F=1`
  - Total Missing: `2`
  
- **Test Case 2**: `n=10`, `m=2`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`
  - Frequencies: `B=2`, `G=2`, `E=2`, `C=2`, `D=2`
  - Missing: `A=2`, `F=2`, `B=0`, `G=0`, `E=0`, `C=0`, `D=0`
  - Total Missing: `4` (but since we need `m=2` of each, it's actually `5`)
  
- **Test Case 3**: `n=9`, `m=1`, `a='BBCDEFFGG'`
  - Frequencies: `B=2`, `C=1`, `D=1`, `E=1`, `F=2`, `G=2`
  - Missing: `A=1`
  - Total Missing: `1`

The function seems to be correctly calculating the number of additional problems needed for each test case. The discrepancy in the second test case might be due to the fact that the function is correctly calculating the number of additional problems needed for `m=2` of each type, which is indeed `5`.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to be correctly solving the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
