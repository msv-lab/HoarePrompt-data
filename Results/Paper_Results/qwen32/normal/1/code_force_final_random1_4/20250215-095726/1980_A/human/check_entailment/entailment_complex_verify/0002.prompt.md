You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vlad needs to organize `m` rounds, each requiring exactly one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - He has `n` problems available, each with a specific difficulty level.
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that each round can have one problem of each difficulty level.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program starts by defining the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.
   - Inside `func_1`, it initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `m`, and `a` (the string of problem difficulties).
   - It initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (one for each difficulty level 'A' to 'G') to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the available problems.
   - It iterates over the string `a` and updates the frequency array accordingly.
   - It calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by checking how many more problems of each type are needed (`max(0, m - f)` where `f` is the current frequency of a difficulty level). This ensures that if there are enough problems of a certain type, it doesn't add any to the missing count.
   - It sums up the missing problems across all difficulty levels and appends this total to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly counts the number of problems needed for each difficulty level.
   - It ensures that for each round (`m`), it checks if there are enough problems of each type and calculates the deficit.
   - The sum of these deficits gives the minimum number of additional problems required.

4. **Verification Against Example:**
   - Let's verify the first test case: `n=10`, `m=1`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`.
     - Frequencies: B=2, G=2, E=2, C=1, D=2.
     - Missing: A=1, F=1 (since each difficulty level is needed once per round).
     - Total missing: 2.
   - This matches the expected output for the first test case.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case.
