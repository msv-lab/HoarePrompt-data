### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Vlad needs to hold `m` rounds, each requiring one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
- Vlad has `n` problems available, each with a specific difficulty level.
- The goal is to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that each round can have one problem of each difficulty level.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by defining the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - Iterates through each test case, extracting `n`, `m`, and `a`.
   - Initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 to count occurrences of each difficulty level.
   - Updates the frequency array based on the string `a`.
   - Calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level using `max(0, m - f)`.
   - Sums up the missing problems and appends this total to the `results` list.
   - Returns the `results` list.

3. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly initializes and processes each test case.
   - They show that the frequency array `freq` is updated correctly based on the input string `a`.
   - The calculation of `missing` is verified to correctly determine the deficit of each difficulty level.
   - The final `results` list is correctly populated with the total number of missing problems for each test case.

4. **Verification Against Example:**
   - **First Test Case:** `n=10`, `m=1`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`
     - Frequencies: B=2, G=2, E=2, C=1, D=2.
     - Missing: A=1, F=1 (since each difficulty level is needed once per round).
     - Total missing: 2.
   - **Second Test Case:** `n=10`, `m=2`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`
     - Frequencies: B=2, G=2, E=2, C=1, D=2.
     - Missing: A=2, B=0, C=1, D=0, E=0, F=2, G=0.
     - Total missing: 5.
   - **Third Test Case:** `n=9`, `m=1`, `a='BBCDEFFGG'`
     - Frequencies: B=2, C=1, D=1, E=1, F=2, G=2.
     - Missing: A=1, B=0, C=0, D=0, E=0, F=0, G=0.
     - Total missing: 1.
   - These match the expected outputs for the respective test cases.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case.
   - The annotations support the correctness of the program's behavior at each step.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
