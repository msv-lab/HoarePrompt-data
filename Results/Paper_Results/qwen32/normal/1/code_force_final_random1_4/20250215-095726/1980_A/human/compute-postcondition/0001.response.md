Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, an integer m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; results is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `results` is initialized as an empty list, while the values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
