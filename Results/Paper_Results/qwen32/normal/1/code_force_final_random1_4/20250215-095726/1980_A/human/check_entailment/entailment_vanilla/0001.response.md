Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vlad needs to organize `m` rounds, each requiring exactly one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - He has `n` problems available, each with a specific difficulty level.
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that each round can have one problem of each difficulty level.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program starts by defining the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.
   - Inside `func_1`, it initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `m`, and `a` (the string of problem difficulties).
   - It initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (one for each difficulty level 'A' to 'G') to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the available problems.
   - It iterates over the string `a` and updates the frequency array accordingly.
   - It calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by checking how many more problems of each type are needed (`max(0, m - f)` where `f` is the current frequency of a difficulty level). This ensures that if there are enough problems of a certain type, it doesn't add any to the missing count.
   - It sums up the missing problems across all difficulty levels and appends this total to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly counts the number of problems needed for each difficulty level.
   - It ensures that for each round (`m`), it checks if there are enough problems of each type and calculates the deficit.
   - The sum of these deficits gives the minimum number of additional problems required.

4. **Verification Against Example:**
   - Let's verify the first test case: `n=10`, `m=1`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`.
     - Frequencies: B=2, G=2, E=2, C=1, D=2.
     - Missing: A=1, F=1 (since each difficulty level is needed once per round).
     - Total missing: 2.
   - This matches the expected output for the first test case.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
