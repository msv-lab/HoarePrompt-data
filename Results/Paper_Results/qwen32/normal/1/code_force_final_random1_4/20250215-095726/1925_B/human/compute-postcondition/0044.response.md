The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value, and it must still be within the range specified by the loop.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value at the end of the previous iteration, we simply need to ensure that the new value of `i` is still less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`.

State: **`x` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer, `q` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, ensuring `i` is still less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`**.
