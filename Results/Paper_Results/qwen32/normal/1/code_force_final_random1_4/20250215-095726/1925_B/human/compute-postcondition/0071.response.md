The code snippet `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 5, `ans` will be updated to 5 if its current value is less than 5. If `ans` is already 5 or greater, it will retain its value.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 5, and `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and 5.**
