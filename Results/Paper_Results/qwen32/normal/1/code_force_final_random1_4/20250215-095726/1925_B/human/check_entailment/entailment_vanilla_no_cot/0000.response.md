To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the maximum balance (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems for each test case.

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to split a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Approach of the Program:**
   - The program iterates over possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x` can be expressed as `n * i + k * i` where `k` is a non-negative integer. If so, `i` could be a potential candidate for the GCD.
   - It also checks the corresponding divisor `x // i` in a similar manner.
   - The program keeps track of the maximum valid divisor found.

3. **Key Points:**
   - The program correctly considers both `i` and `x // i` as potential candidates for the GCD.
   - It ensures that the sum of the difficulties of the sub-problems equals `x`.
   - The program efficiently limits the search space to divisors up to the square root of `x`.

4. **Validation Against Example:**
   - For the first test case (`x=10`, `n=3`), the program finds `i=2` as a valid divisor and calculates the maximum balance as `2`.
   - For the second test case (`x=5`, `n=5`), the only valid divisor is `1`, resulting in a balance of `1`.
   - For the third test case (`x=420`, `n=69`), the program finds `i=6` as a valid divisor and calculates the maximum balance as `6`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset by considering all possible divisors of `x` and checking if they can form valid sub-problems that sum up to `x`. Given the constraints and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct.
