Postcondition: **`x` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer, `q` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `x` is divisible by `i`. The current value of `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i)` is equal to 0. `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `i`.**
