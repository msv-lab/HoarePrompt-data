The code snippet updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Given that `ans` was initially set to 1, after executing the code, `ans` will be updated to `i` if `i` is greater than 1. Otherwise, it will remain 1.

The other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\); `n` is an integer; `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `i`; `x` is divisible by `i`; `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0; `x - n * i` is divisible by `i`.**
