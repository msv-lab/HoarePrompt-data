### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum balance (GCD) of a set of `n` positive integers whose sum equals `x`. The approach taken in the provided code is to iterate through potential divisors of `x` up to its square root. For each divisor `i`, the code checks two conditions:
1. If `i` can be used as the GCD of the sub-problems, meaning `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`.
2. Similarly, it checks the same conditions for `x // i`.

Let's analyze why this approach works:

- **Divisor Check**: By iterating up to the square root of `x`, we ensure that we check all possible divisors efficiently. This is because if `d` is a divisor of `x`, then `x/d` is also a divisor.
  
- **Feasibility Check**: For each divisor `i`, the code checks if it's feasible to split `x` into `n` parts where each part is a multiple of `i`. Specifically, it checks if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`. This ensures that the remaining part after allocating `i` to each of the `n` sub-problems can still be distributed evenly among the sub-problems.

- **Maximizing Balance**: The code keeps track of the maximum feasible divisor found during the iteration, which represents the maximum possible balance.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset by checking all possible divisors of `x` and ensuring that they can form a valid set of `n` sub-problems. Therefore, the code is correct.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The code efficiently finds the maximum possible GCD by iterating through all divisors of `x` up to its square root and checking if they can form a valid set of `n` sub-problems.
