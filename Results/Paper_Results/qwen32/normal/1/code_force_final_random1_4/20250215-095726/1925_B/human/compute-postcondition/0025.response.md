To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the definition of `ans`.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `ans` is defined as the largest divisor of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`.
- `d` can be either `i` or `x // i`.

### Understanding the Condition:

- `x - n * d >= 0` implies that `x` is at least `n * d`.
- `x - n * d` must be divisible by `d`, which means `x % d == 0`.

### Determining `ans`:

- `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the above conditions.
- Since `d` can be either `i` or `x // i`, it suggests that `i` is a divisor of `x`, and `x // i` is also a divisor of `x`.
- The largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the condition would be `x` itself if `x` is divisible by `d` and `x - n * x` is non-negative (which simplifies to `x - n * x = x * (1 - n) >= 0`). This condition is only true if `n <= 1`.

However, without specific values for `x`, `n`, and `i`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. But we can describe `ans` precisely based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion:

Given the conditions, `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`, where `d` is either `i` or `x // i`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x such that x - n * d is non-negative and divisible by d, with d being either i or x // i)**
