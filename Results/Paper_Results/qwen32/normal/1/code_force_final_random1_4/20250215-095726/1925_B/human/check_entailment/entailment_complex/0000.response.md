### Reasoning:

The goal of the program is to find the maximum balance (GCD) of the difficulties of sub-problems when breaking a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems. The program iterates through potential divisors of `x` up to its square root to check if they can be used as the difficulties of the sub-problems while ensuring that the remaining difficulty can be evenly distributed among the remaining sub-problems.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, initialize `ans` to 1, which represents the minimum possible GCD.

2. **Iterate Through Divisors**: Loop through potential divisors `i` from 1 up to the square root of `x`. This is efficient because if `i` is a divisor of `x`, then `x/i` is also a divisor, and we only need to check up to the square root to cover both pairs of divisors.

3. **Check Divisibility and Validity**:
   - For each divisor `i`, check if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`. If true, update `ans` to the maximum of its current value and `i`.
   - Similarly, check the complementary divisor `x/i`. If `x - n * (x/i)` is non-negative and divisible by `x/i`, update `ans` to the maximum of its current value and `x/i`.

4. **Output**: After processing all divisors for a test case, output the maximum `ans` found.

This approach ensures that we consider all possible ways to divide `x` into `n` parts with a common divisor, thereby maximizing the GCD of the resulting sub-problems.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance for each test case as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified.

**Correctness: True**
