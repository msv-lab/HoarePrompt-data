The code snippet updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. This means that if `i` is greater than `ans`, `ans` will take the value of `i`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ans`, which now holds the maximum value between its previous value and `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\), `n` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `i`.**
