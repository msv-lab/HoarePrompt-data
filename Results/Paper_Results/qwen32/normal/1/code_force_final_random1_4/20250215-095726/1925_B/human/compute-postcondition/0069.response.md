Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 4, and `ans` retains its previous value unless `x % i == 0`. If `x % i == 0` and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // 4`. Otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value.**
