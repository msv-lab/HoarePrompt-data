You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `n` times, printing a value for each iteration based on the conditions involving `A`, `B`, and `C`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their initial values. The variable `X` may have been defined in some iterations but is not relevant to the final output state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. It then prints a calculated value based on specific conditions involving `A`, `B`, and `C`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without modifying the input values `t`, `A`, `B`, or `C`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Program Analysis:

The program reads multiple test cases, each containing three integers: `n` (the number of yogurts), `a` (the price of one yogurt), and `b` (the price of two yogurts under promotion). It then calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts using the following logic:

1. If the cost of two yogurts (`b`) is greater than twice the cost of one yogurt (`2 * a`), it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. Thus, the total cost is `n * a`.
2. If `n` is even, it is cheaper to buy pairs of yogurts at the promotional price. Thus, the total cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
3. If `n` is odd, it buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and buys the remaining yogurt individually. Thus, the total cost is `((n // 2) * b) + a`.

### Potential Issues:

Let's check the provided program against the problem description and the given examples:

- **First condition:** `if B * 2 < C:` This condition is incorrect because it should check if `2 * a < b`, not `B * 2 < C`. The variable names are mixed up here. It should be `if 2 * a < b`.
  
- **Second condition:** `elif A % 2 == 0:` This part seems correct. If `n` is even, buying pairs at the promotional price is optimal.
  
- **Third condition:** `else:` This part also seems correct. If `n` is odd, it buys as many pairs as possible and then buys the remaining yogurt individually.

### Corrected Code:

Based on the above analysis, the corrected version of the code should be:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(n * a)
        elif n % 2 == 0:
            print(int(n * b / 2))
        else:
            X = n // 2
            print(X * b + a)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has a logical error due to the incorrect condition `if B * 2 < C:`. This means that the program might not always calculate the minimum cost correctly.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly checks the condition `if B * 2 < C:` instead of `if 2 * a < b:`. This leads to incorrect calculations for the minimum cost in some cases.
