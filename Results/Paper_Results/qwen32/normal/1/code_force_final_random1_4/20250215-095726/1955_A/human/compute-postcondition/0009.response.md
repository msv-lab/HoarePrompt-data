To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable does not directly affect the print statement.
2. `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
3. `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`.
4. `A` is an odd integer.
5. `X` is `A // 2`.

### Calculation of Variables:
- Since `A` is an odd integer, `A // 2` will result in an integer division that truncates the decimal part. For example, if `A = 5`, then `X = 5 // 2 = 2`.
- The expression `X * C + B` will be evaluated next.

### Expression Evaluation:
- `X` is `A // 2`.
- Therefore, `X * C` is `(A // 2) * C`.
- Adding `B` to this result gives `(A // 2) * C + B`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the variables, the exact numerical value cannot be determined without specific values for `A`, `B`, and `C`. However, we can precisely describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A is an odd integer, B and C are integers such that B * 2 ≥ C)**
