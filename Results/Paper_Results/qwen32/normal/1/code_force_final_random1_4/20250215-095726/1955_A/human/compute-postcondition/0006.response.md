Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable `t` does not directly influence the print statement.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.
- `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`.
- The current value of `A` is even.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int(A * C / 2))
```

### Analysis:
- The expression inside the `print` statement is `int(A * C / 2)`.
- Since `A` is even, `A * C` will always be an integer multiple of `C` (regardless of whether `C` is even or odd).
- Dividing an even number (`A`) by 2 will result in an integer. Multiplying this result by any integer `C` will also result in an integer.
- The `int()` function is used here, but since `A * C / 2` will already be an integer (because `A` is even), the `int()` function does not change the value.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the integer result of the expression `A * C / 2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **A * C / 2 (where A is an even integer and C is an integer such that B * 2 >= C)**
