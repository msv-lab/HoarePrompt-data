The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. It then prints a calculated value based on specific conditions involving `A`, `B`, and `C`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without modifying the input values `t`, `A`, `B`, or `C`.
