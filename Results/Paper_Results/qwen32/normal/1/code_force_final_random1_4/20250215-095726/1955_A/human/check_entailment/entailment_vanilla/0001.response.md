Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
- Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts.
- The cost of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The cost of two yogurts with promotion is `b` burles.
- We need to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

### Logic Analysis
The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price per yogurt), and `b` (price for two yogurts with promotion).

2. **Decision Making:**
   - If `2*a < b`, it means buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them with the promotion. Hence, the total cost is `n * a`.
   - If `n` is even, the best strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs using the promotion, so the total cost is `(n/2) * b`.
   - If `n` is odd, the best strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible using the promotion and then buy the remaining yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `((n//2) * b) + a`.

### Correctness Verification
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Since `2*5 < 9`, the cost is `2 * 5 = 10`. However, the promotion price for 2 yogurts is 9, which is cheaper. Thus, the output should be `9`.
   - The program correctly outputs `9`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Since `2*5 < 9`, the cost would be `3 * 5 = 15`. However, the promotion price for 2 yogurts is 9, and we can buy 2 yogurts for 9 and 1 yogurt for 5, totaling `9 + 5 = 14`.
   - The program correctly outputs `14`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Here, `2*5 = 10` is not less than `11`, so we consider the promotion. Since `n` is odd, we buy 2 yogurts for 11 and 1 yogurt for 5, totaling `11 + 5 = 16`. However, buying all 3 yogurts individually would cost `3 * 5 = 15`, which is cheaper.
   - The program correctly outputs `15`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Since `n` is even, the best strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs using the promotion, so the total cost is `(4/2) * 11 = 22`. However, buying all 4 yogurts individually would cost `4 * 5 = 20`, which is cheaper.
   - The program correctly outputs `20`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles all the given scenarios and edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
