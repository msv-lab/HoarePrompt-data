Let's carefully re-evaluate the logic and correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, program code, and annotations.

### Problem Breakdown
- Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts.
- The cost of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The cost of two yogurts with promotion is `b` burles.
- We need to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

### Logic Analysis
The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price per yogurt), and `b` (price for two yogurts with promotion).

2. **Decision Making:**
   - If `2*a < b`, it means buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them with the promotion. Hence, the total cost is `n * a`.
   - If `n` is even, the best strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs using the promotion, so the total cost is `(n/2) * b`.
   - If `n` is odd, the best strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible using the promotion and then buy the remaining yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `((n//2) * b) + a`.

### Correctness Verification
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Since `2*5 = 10` is not less than `9`, the promotion price for 2 yogurts is 9, which is cheaper. Thus, the output should be `9`.
   - The program correctly outputs `9`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Since `2*5 = 10` is not less than `9`, the promotion price for 2 yogurts is 9, and we can buy 2 yogurts for 9 and 1 yogurt for 5, totaling `9 + 5 = 14`.
   - The program correctly outputs `14`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Here, `2*5 = 10` is less than `11`, so buying two yogurts individually is cheaper. Therefore, the best strategy is to buy all 3 yogurts individually, costing `3 * 5 = 15`.
   - The program correctly outputs `15`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Since `2*5 = 10` is less than `11`, buying two yogurts individually is cheaper. Therefore, the best strategy is to buy all 4 yogurts individually, costing `4 * 5 = 20`.
   - The program correctly outputs `20`.

### Re-evaluation of the Original Assessment
Upon closer inspection, the original assessment contains a mistake in the interpretation of the first condition (`if B * 2 < C`). The condition should be `if B * 2 <= C` because if `2*a` equals `b`, buying two yogurts individually is not necessarily more expensive than buying them with the promotion. Both strategies cost the same, and the promotion might still be preferable due to potential rounding issues or other factors.

However, the program as written uses `if B * 2 < C`, which is correct in terms of strictly cheaper individual purchase. The logic for even and odd `n` is correct.

### Conclusion
The program is correct based on the given problem description and the logic implemented. The original assessment was mostly accurate, except for the minor detail about the equality condition, which does not affect the correctness of the program in the context of the problem.

Final: **True**
