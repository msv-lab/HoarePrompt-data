### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Cost:**
   - The program uses the following logic to calculate the minimum cost:
     - If `b * 2 < a`: This condition checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually. However, this condition is not correctly implemented because it should check if `b < a * 2` instead. The current implementation would incorrectly suggest buying two yogurts individually when the promotion price is cheaper.
     - If `n % 2 == 0`: If the number of yogurts `n` is even, the program calculates the cost as `(n * b) / 2`, which is correct since buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price is optimal.
     - Otherwise, if `n` is odd, the program calculates the cost as `((n // 2) * b) + a`, which is also correct because it buys as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and buys the remaining yogurt individually.

3. **Comparison with Example Output:**
   - Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
     - For `n=2`, `a=5`, `b=9`: The program should print `9` because buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper.
     - For `n=3`, `a=5`, `b=9`: The program should print `14` because buying two yogurts at the promotion price and one individually is cheaper.
     - For `n=3`, `a=5`, `b=11`: The program should print `15` because buying three yogurts individually is cheaper than buying two at the promotion price and one individually.
     - For `n=4`, `a=5`, `b=11`: The program should print `22` because buying two pairs of yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper. However, the expected output is `20`, indicating that the program might be incorrectly handling the condition `b * 2 < a`.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical error in the condition `if B * 2 < C:`. It should be `if b < a * 2:` to correctly determine if buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper. Given this error, the program does not always produce the correct output.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
