### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and verify if it correctly computes the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given promotion.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts with promotion).

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation:**
   - The program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`a * 2`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotional price (`b`). If true, it calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of yogurts `n` by the price of one yogurt `a` and prints this value.
   - If the above condition is not met, it checks if the number of yogurts `n` is even. If true, it calculates the total cost by multiplying half of `n` by the promotional price `b` and prints this value.
   - If `n` is odd, it calculates the total cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and buys the remaining single yogurt at the regular price. Specifically, it calculates the number of pairs (`X = A // 2`), multiplies this by the promotional price `b`, and adds the price of one yogurt `a`.

3. **Verification Against Example Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `n=2`, `a=5`, `b=9`
     - Since `a*2=10` which is greater than `b=9`, it buys 2 yogurts at the promotional price.
     - Output: `9`
   - **Test Case 2:** `n=3`, `a=5`, `b=9`
     - Since `a*2=10` which is greater than `b=9`, it buys 2 yogurts at the promotional price and 1 yogurt at the regular price.
     - Output: `9+5=14`
   - **Test Case 3:** `n=3`, `a=5`, `b=11`
     - Since `a*2=10` which is less than `b=11`, it buys 3 yogurts at the regular price.
     - Output: `5*3=15`
   - **Test Case 4:** `n=4`, `a=5`, `b=11`
     - Since `a*2=10` which is less than `b=11`, it buys 4 yogurts at the regular price.
     - Output: `5*4=20`

The program correctly handles all scenarios and produces the expected output for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
