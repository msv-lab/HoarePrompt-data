The provided code snippet reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` from the input and assigns them to the respective variables. No other operations are performed in the given snippet that would affect the variables `t`, `X`, or `i` as described in the initial state.

Therefore, the only change is that `A`, `B`, and `C` are now assigned the values read from the input. The values of `t`, `X`, and `i` remain unchanged unless further operations are specified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input; `X` is not defined or retains its previous value; `i` is k + 1**
