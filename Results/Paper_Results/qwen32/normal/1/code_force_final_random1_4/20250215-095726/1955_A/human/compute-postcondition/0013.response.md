The provided code snippet only includes the input reading part and does not include the logic described in the initial state. Therefore, the variables `A`, `B`, and `C` will be updated with the values read from the input, and no further changes will be made to them based on the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.**
This means that `t` retains its initial value, and `A`, `B`, and `C` now hold the values read from the input. No other changes are made to the variables as per the provided code snippet.
