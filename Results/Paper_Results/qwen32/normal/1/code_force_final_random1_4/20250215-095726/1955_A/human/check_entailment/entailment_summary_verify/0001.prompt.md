You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. It then prints a calculated value based on specific conditions involving `A`, `B`, and `C`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without modifying the input values `t`, `A`, `B`, or `C`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
- Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts.
- The cost of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The cost of two yogurts with promotion is `b` burles.
- We need to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

### Logic Analysis
The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price per yogurt), and `b` (price for two yogurts with promotion).

2. **Decision Making:**
   - If `2*a < b`, it means buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them with the promotion. Hence, the total cost is `n * a`.
   - If `n` is even, the best strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs using the promotion, so the total cost is `(n/2) * b`.
   - If `n` is odd, the best strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible using the promotion and then buy the remaining yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `((n//2) * b) + a`.

### Correctness Verification
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Since `2*5 < 9`, the cost is `2 * 5 = 10`. However, the promotion price for 2 yogurts is 9, which is cheaper. Thus, the output should be `9`.
   - The program correctly outputs `9`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Since `2*5 < 9`, the cost would be `3 * 5 = 15`. However, the promotion price for 2 yogurts is 9, and we can buy 2 yogurts for 9 and 1 yogurt for 5, totaling `9 + 5 = 14`.
   - The program correctly outputs `14`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Here, `2*5 = 10` is not less than `11`, so we consider the promotion. Since `n` is odd, we buy 2 yogurts for 11 and 1 yogurt for 5, totaling `11 + 5 = 16`. However, buying all 3 yogurts individually would cost `3 * 5 = 15`, which is cheaper.
   - The program correctly outputs `15`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Since `n` is even, the best strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs using the promotion, so the total cost is `(4/2) * 11 = 22`. However, buying all 4 yogurts individually would cost `4 * 5 = 20`, which is cheaper.
   - The program correctly outputs `20`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles all the given scenarios and edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
