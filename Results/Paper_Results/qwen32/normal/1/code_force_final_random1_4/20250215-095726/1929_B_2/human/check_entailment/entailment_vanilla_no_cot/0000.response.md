Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for each test case. Let's analyze why it is incorrect.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the number of required diagonals \( k \) equals the total number of diagonals \( 4n - 2 \). If they are equal, it outputs \( k // 2 + 1 \). Otherwise, it outputs \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

However, this approach does not accurately determine the minimum number of cells needed to cover at least \( k \) diagonals. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **When \( k = 4n - 2 \):**
   - The formula \( k // 2 + 1 \) is incorrect. For example, when \( n = 3 \), \( 4n - 2 = 10 \). The correct answer should be 5 because you need to cover all 10 diagonals, and the optimal way is to color cells such that each diagonal is covered exactly once, which requires 5 cells.
   
2. **When \( k < 4n - 2 \):**
   - The formula \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) is also incorrect. For example, when \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \), the correct answer is 2. The optimal strategy is to color two cells such that they cover four diagonals.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the structure of the diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid:
- There are \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right and \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left.
- To minimize the number of cells colored while covering at least \( k \) diagonals, we should strategically place the colored cells.

The optimal strategy involves placing cells in such a way that each cell covers the maximum number of diagonals. A common approach is to use a pattern where cells are placed along a path that crosses through the center of the grid, ensuring that each cell covers multiple diagonals.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        # Minimum number of cells needed to cover k diagonals
        # This is equivalent to finding the smallest number of cells
        # that can cover at least k diagonals optimally.
        # The optimal strategy involves placing cells along a path
        # that crosses through the center of the grid.
        # The formula derived from this strategy is:
        result = ceil(k / 2)
        print(result)

func()
```

However, even this simplified formula might not always yield the correct result for all edge cases. A more precise approach would involve simulating the placement of cells and counting the diagonals covered, but the above formula works for most practical purposes given the constraints.

Given the original program's logic, it does not correctly handle the problem requirements, hence the correctness is False.
