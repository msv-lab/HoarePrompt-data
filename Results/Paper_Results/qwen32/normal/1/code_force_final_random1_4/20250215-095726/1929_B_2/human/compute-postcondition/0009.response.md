The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the initial values of `n` and `k` (which were unspecified) are now set to the values provided by the input.

Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged, and `_` also remains unchanged. The condition regarding `k` being equal to `4 * n - 2` is not evaluated by this code snippet, so it does not affect the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `_` is 1**.
