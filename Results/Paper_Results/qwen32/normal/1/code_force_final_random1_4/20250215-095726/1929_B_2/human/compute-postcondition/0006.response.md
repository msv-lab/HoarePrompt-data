To determine what will be printed by the `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's break down the given information and the operations involved:

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `t`: An input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This variable represents the number of test cases but does not directly affect the calculation inside the print statement.
   - `n` and `k`: Integers read from the input.
   - The condition \(4 \cdot n - 2 \neq k\) is provided, but it doesn't directly influence the calculation of `ceil(k / 2)`.

2. **Operation Inside the Print Statement:**
   - `k / 2`: This operation divides the integer `k` by 2. Since `k` is an integer, this division results in a floating-point number if `k` is odd.
   - `ceil(k / 2)`: The `ceil` function rounds up the result of `k / 2` to the nearest integer.

3. **Possible Values of `k / 2` and `ceil(k / 2)`:**
   - If `k` is even, `k / 2` is already an integer, so `ceil(k / 2)` equals `k / 2`.
   - If `k` is odd, `k / 2` is a floating-point number with a fractional part of 0.5. The `ceil` function rounds this up to the next whole number, which is `(k // 2) + 1`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of `ceil(k / 2)` depends on whether `k` is even or odd.
   - If `k` is even, the output is `k / 2`.
   - If `k` is odd, the output is `(k // 2) + 1`.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where ceil(k / 2) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k / 2)**
