Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `_` is 2. If `4 * n - 2 == k`, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part. In both cases, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `_` remain unchanged.**
