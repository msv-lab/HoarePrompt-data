Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a string with at least 3 characters; `j` is 1; `i` is `i+1` where `i` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. If the character at position `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1`, then `count` is incremented by 1 (or set to 3 if the character at position `j` is '0' and the character at position `j + 1` is '1'), and `flag` is True if the character at position `j` is '0' and the character at position `j + 1` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False. If the character at position `j` in `s` is equal to the character at position `j + 1`, then `count` and `flag` remain unchanged.**
