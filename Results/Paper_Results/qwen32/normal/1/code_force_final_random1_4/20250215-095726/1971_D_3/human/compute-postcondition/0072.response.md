Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a newly input string with `len(s)` greater than 1; `j` is 0; `i` is `i+1`. If the character at position `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1`, then `count` is 2 and `flag` is True if the character at position `j` in `s` is '0' and the character at position `j + 1` in `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False.**
