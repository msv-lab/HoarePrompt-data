Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tt` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 1; `i` is `len(a) - 1`; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input; `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`; `tmp` contains an additional element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`; `ii` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
