Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `2x - 2` remains unchanged, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `n` is the first value provided in the input, `x` is the second value provided in the input, `y` is the third value provided in the input, `t` is `t + x`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, each decreased by 1, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the modified list `a`, `ans` is `x - 2 + k` where `k` is the number of times `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st` during the loop iterations.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
    gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
    if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
        odd.append(gap)
    elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
        even.append(gap)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `2x - 2` remains unchanged, `n` is the first value provided in the input, `x` is the second value provided in the input and must be greater than 0, `y` is the third value provided in the input, `t` is `t + x`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, each decreased by 1, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the modified list `a`, `ans` is `x - 2 + k` where `k` is the number of times `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st` during the loop iterations, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i == x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` is a list containing `[gap]` and `even` is an empty list. Otherwise, `odd` is an empty list and `even` is a list containing the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even, otherwise `even` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `2x - 2` remains unchanged, `n` is the first value provided in the input, `x` is the second value provided in the input and must be greater than 0, `y` is the third value provided in the input, `t` is `t + x`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, each decreased by 1, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the modified list `a`, `ans` is `x - 2 + k` where `k` is the number of times `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st` during the loop iterations, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i == x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `odd` is a list containing `[gap]` if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, otherwise `odd` is an empty list, and `even` is a list containing the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even, otherwise `even` remains an empty list, `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `2x - 2` remains unchanged, `n` is the first value provided in the input, `x` is the second value provided in the input and must be greater than 0, `y` is the third value provided in the input, `t` is `t + x`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, each decreased by 1, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the modified list `a`, `ans` is `x - 2 + k` where `k` is the number of times `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in `st` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in `st` during the loop iterations, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i == x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `odd` is a list containing `[gap, gap]` if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, otherwise `odd` is an empty list, and `even` is a list containing the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even, otherwise `even` remains an empty list, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` now includes the current value of `gap`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
