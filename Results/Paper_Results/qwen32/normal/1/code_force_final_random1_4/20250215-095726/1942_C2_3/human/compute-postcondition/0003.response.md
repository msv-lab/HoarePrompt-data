The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `t`, `tt`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `tt` must be greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
