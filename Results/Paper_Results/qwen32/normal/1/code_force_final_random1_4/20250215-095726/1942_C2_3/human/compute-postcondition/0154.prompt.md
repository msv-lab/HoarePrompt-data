Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is 0, n is the first integer read from the input, x is the second integer read from the input, y is the third integer read from the input, R is defined as a lambda function that maps input split by spaces to integers, l is a list of integers read from the input and split by spaces, now sorted in ascending order with an additional element n + l[0] appended to it, val is a list containing the value of c for each iteration from 1 to x, sorted such that all even numbers come before odd numbers and within each group, the numbers are sorted in ascending order, sx is the count of how many times c was equal to 1, cons is the minimum of n - 2 and the original value of cons.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `y` is `y - c`, `R` is defined as a lambda function that maps input split by spaces to integers, `l` is a list of integers read from the input and split by spaces, now sorted in ascending order with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is a list containing the value of `c` for each iteration from 1 to `x`, sorted such that all even numbers come before odd numbers and within each group, the numbers are sorted in ascending order, `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and the original value of `cons`, `c` is `i // 2`. If `y` is less than `c`, `sx` is incremented by `y * 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `sx`. `sx` is incremented by `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `y` is `y - c - c`, `R` is defined as a lambda function that maps input split by spaces to integers, `l` is a list of integers read from the input and split by spaces, now sorted in ascending order with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is a list containing the value of `c` for each iteration from 1 to `x`, sorted such that all even numbers come before odd numbers and within each group, the numbers are sorted in ascending order, `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and the original value of `cons`, `c` is `(val[k+1]) // 2`, `i` is `val[k+1]`. If `y < c`, `sx` is updated to `sx + y * 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `sx` is updated to `sx + i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `y` is `y - 3*c`, `R` is defined as a lambda function that maps input split by spaces to integers, `l` is a list of integers read from the input and split by spaces, now sorted in ascending order with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `val` is a list containing the value of `c` for each iteration from 1 to `x`, sorted such that all even numbers come before odd numbers and within each group, the numbers are sorted in ascending order, `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and the original value of `cons`, `c` is `(val[k+2]) // 2`, `i` is `val[k+2]`, `sx` is `sx + i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
