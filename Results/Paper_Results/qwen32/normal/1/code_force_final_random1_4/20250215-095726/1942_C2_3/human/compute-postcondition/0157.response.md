To determine the output of the `print(cons)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is initialized to 0.
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input.
   - `x` is the second integer read from the input.
   - `y` is defined as `y - sum(i // 2 for i in val)`, but since `y` is not explicitly defined or used elsewhere in the given context, it does not affect the calculation of `cons`.
   - `R` is a lambda function that converts input strings split by spaces into integers.
   - `l` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, sorted in ascending order, and then an additional element `n + l[0]` is appended to it.
   - `val` is a list containing the value of `c` for each iteration from 1 to `x`, sorted such that all even numbers come before odd numbers and within each group, the numbers are sorted in ascending order.
   - `sx` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `val`.
   - `cons` is defined as `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`.

2. **Calculation of `cons`**:
   - `cons` is calculated using the formula `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`.
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input.
   - `x` is the second integer read from the input.
   - `sx` is the sum of the elements in `val`.

3. **Determining the Value of `val` and `sx`**:
   - `val` contains the value of `c` for each iteration from 1 to `x`.
   - Since the exact values of `c` are not specified, we assume `c` is the loop variable `i` itself for simplicity.
   - Therefore, `val` would be `[1, 2, ..., x]`.
   - `val` is then sorted such that all even numbers come before odd numbers and within each group, the numbers are sorted in ascending order.
   - For example, if `x = 5`, `val` would initially be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and after sorting, it would be `[2, 4, 1, 3, 5]`.
   - `sx` is the sum of the elements in `val`. If `val` is `[2, 4, 1, 3, 5]`, then `sx = 2 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 15`.

4. **Final Calculation of `cons`**:
   - Given `n` and `x` from the input, and `sx` calculated as above, `cons` is `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`.
   - For example, if `n = 10` and `x = 5`, then `cons = min(10 - 2, 5 + 15 - 2) = min(8, 18) = 8`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(cons)` statement depends on the specific values of `n` and `x` read from the input and the resulting `sx` calculated from `val`.

Given the lack of specific input values, the final output can be described as follows:

Output: **cons (where cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, with sx being the sum of the sorted list val containing values from 1 to x, sorted such that all even numbers come before odd numbers and within each group, the numbers are sorted in ascending order)**
