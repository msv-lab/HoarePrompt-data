Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. It returns a result based on these inputs for each test case. Specifically, Case_1: If the conditions are met, it returns a specific value or result for that test case; otherwise, it handles the input according to the problem's requirements.** 

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the exact return value would depend on the logic within the function, but generally, it processes each test case independently and provides an output for each one.
