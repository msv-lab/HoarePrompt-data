You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array \( a \) such that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \). Let's analyze the program and provide a counterexample to demonstrate its incorrectness.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program initializes \( a[0] \) to 1000 and then sets each subsequent element \( a[i] \) to \( a[i-1] + x[i-1] \).

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
1 1
```
According to the problem, we need to find an array \( a \) such that:
- \( a_2 \mod a_1 = 1 \)
- \( a_3 \mod a_2 = 1 \)

Let's see what the program outputs for this input:
- \( a[0] = 1000 \)
- \( a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 1000 + 1 = 1001 \)
- \( a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 1001 + 1 = 1002 \)

So, the output array is \( [1000, 1001, 1002] \).

Now, let's check the conditions:
- \( a_2 \mod a_1 = 1001 \mod 1000 = 1 \) (This condition is satisfied.)
- \( a_3 \mod a_2 = 1002 \mod 1001 = 1 \) (This condition is also satisfied.)

However, the issue arises with other inputs. Consider another input:
```
1
3
2 1
```
For this input, the program will output:
- \( a[0] = 1000 \)
- \( a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 1000 + 2 = 1002 \)
- \( a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 1002 + 1 = 1003 \)

So, the output array is \( [1000, 1002, 1003] \).

Now, let's check the conditions:
- \( a_2 \mod a_1 = 1002 \mod 1000 = 2 \) (This condition is not satisfied.)

Thus, the program fails to produce the correct array \( a \) for this input.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not satisfy the conditions for all possible inputs, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
