The code snippet modifies the value of `a[i]` where `i` is 5. Given the initial state, `a[5]` does not exist because the list `a` only has indices from 0 to 4. However, the operation `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` will extend the list `a` to include `a[5]`.

Here's the calculation:
- `a[4]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2] + x[3]`.
- `x[i - 1]` is `x[4]` because `i` is 5.
- Therefore, `a[5]` becomes `a[4] + x[4]`, which is `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2] + x[3] + x[4]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 5; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000, `a[1]` is `1000 + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, `a[3]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`, `a[4]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2] + x[3]`, and `a[5]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2] + x[3] + x[4]`; `i` is 5**.
