To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code execution step-by-step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t` is decreased by 1**: This doesn't affect the current state directly since `t` is not used in the provided code snippet. We can ignore this for our purposes.
2. **`n` is an input integer**: This specifies the number of elements in the list `x` and the length of the list `a`.
3. **`x` is a list of integers obtained from the input**: This is a list of integers with `n` elements.
4. **`a` is a list of `n` integers**:
   - `a[0]` is set to 1000.
   - For `i > 0`, `a[i]` is calculated as the cumulative sum of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`.

### Calculation of List `a`:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- For `i = 1` to `n-1`, `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 5` and `x = [10, 20, 30, 40]` for illustration:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 1000 + 10 = 1010`
- `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 1010 + 20 = 1030`
- `a[3] = a[2] + x[2] = 1030 + 30 = 1060`
- `a[4] = a[3] + x[3] = 1060 + 40 = 1100`

Thus, the list `a` would be `[1000, 1010, 1030, 1060, 1100]`.

### Print Statement:
The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### General Output Description:
Given the above calculations, the output will be a sequence of integers starting with 1000, followed by cumulative sums based on the elements of `x`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1000, 1000 + x[0], 1000 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]** (where `x` is the list of integers obtained from the input and `n` is the length of the list `x`)
