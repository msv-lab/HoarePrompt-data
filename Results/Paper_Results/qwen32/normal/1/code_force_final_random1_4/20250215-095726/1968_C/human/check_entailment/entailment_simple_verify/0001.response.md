### Reasoning:
Let's carefully re-evaluate the program using the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find an array `a` such that:
1. \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\).
2. \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).

#### Program Analysis:
The program initializes `a[0]` to 1000 and then sets each subsequent `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. Let's verify if this meets the conditions:

1. **Initialization**: `a[0] = 1000` which is within the range \([1, 10^9]\).
2. **Iteration**: For each `i` from 1 to \(n-1\), `a[i]` is set to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. This ensures `a[i] > a[i-1]` because `x[i-1] \geq 1`.

   - We need to check if `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]`.
   - By construction, `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.
   - Therefore, `a[i] % a[i-1] = (a[i-1] + x[i-1]) % a[i-1] = x[i-1] % a[i-1]`.
   - Since `x[i-1] < a[i-1]` (because `x[i-1]` is a remainder when dividing by `a[i-1]`), `x[i-1] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]`. Thus, `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]` holds true.

3. **Range Check**: The maximum value of `a[i]` can be calculated as follows:
   - `a[0] = 1000`
   - `a[1] = 1000 + x[0]`
   - `a[2] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1]`
   - ...
   - `a[n-1] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`
   
   Given that each `x[i] \leq 500` and there are at most 499 such terms (since `n \leq 500`), the maximum possible value of `a[n-1]` is:
   \[
   1000 + 500 \times 499 = 1000 + 249500 = 250500
   \]
   This value is well within the range \([1, 10^9]\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the array `a` such that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `i` from 2 to `n` and all elements of `a` are within the specified range.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
