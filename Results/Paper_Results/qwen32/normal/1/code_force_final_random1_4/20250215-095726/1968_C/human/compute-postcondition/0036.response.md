The code snippet updates the value of `a[i]` by adding `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `x` are affected accordingly.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is incremented by 1 (implying `i` has a value of at least 1)

After executing the code:
- `a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

Since the exact values of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]` are not specified, we can only express `a[i]` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`**.
