Output State: **The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c. Here, group_a contains the first, fourth, seventh, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list; group_b contains the second, fifth, eighth, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list; and group_c contains the third, sixth, ninth, ..., numbers from the original `numbers` list. Since `numbers` is initially an empty list, group_a, group_b, and group_c are also empty lists.**
