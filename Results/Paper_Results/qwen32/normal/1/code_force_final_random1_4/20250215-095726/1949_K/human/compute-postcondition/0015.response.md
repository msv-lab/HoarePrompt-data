Functionality: **The function `func_2` takes an integer `n`, three group size integers `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and a list of `n` positive integers `numbers`. It sorts the list in descending order and then distributes the numbers into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`) such that `group_a` contains every third number starting from the first, `group_b` contains every third number starting from the second, and `group_c` contains every third number starting from the third. It calculates the sums of these groups and checks a condition using `func_1`. If the condition is met, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
