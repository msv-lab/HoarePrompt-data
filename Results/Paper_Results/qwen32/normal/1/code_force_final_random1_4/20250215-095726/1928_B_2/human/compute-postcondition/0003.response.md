The value of `tem` is updated to be the product of its current value (which is 1) and the element at index `i` in the list `arr`. Since `tem` was initially 1, `tem` now holds the value of `arr[i]`. The values of `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is `arr[i]`**.
