The code appends the value of `tem` to the list `ans`. Since `tem` is initially set to `arr[0] * arr[0]`, appending `tem` to `ans` means that `ans` will now contain two elements, both of which are `arr[0] * arr[0]`.

Given that `arr` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `tem` is the square of the first element of `arr`, and `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `arr[0] * arr[0]`, `tem` is `arr[0] * arr[0]`, `i` is `0`**.
