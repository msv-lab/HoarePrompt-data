To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given information. The loop iterates over the list `arr` in reverse order, multiplying each element with a temporary variable `tem` and appending the result to the list `ans`.

Let's break down the process step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `arr`: A list of integers.
   - `ans`: An initially empty list.
   - `tem`: Initialized to 1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from the last index of `arr` to the first index (inclusive).
   - In each iteration, `tem` is multiplied by the current element of `arr` (`arr[i]`), and the new value of `tem` is appended to `ans`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `ans` contains `[arr[-1]]` and `tem` is `arr[-1]`.
- After 2 iterations: `ans` contains `[arr[-1], arr[-1] * arr[-2]]` and `tem` is `arr[-1] * arr[-2]`.
- After 3 iterations: `ans` contains `[arr[-1], arr[-1] * arr[-2], arr[-1] * arr[-2] * arr[-3]]` and `tem` is `arr[-1] * arr[-2] * arr[-3]`.

From this pattern, we can infer that after all iterations, `ans` will contain the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` in reverse order, starting from the last element to the first.

**Final Output State**:
- `ans` will contain the elements `[arr[-1], arr[-1] * arr[-2], arr[-1] * arr[-2] * arr[-3], ..., arr[-1] * arr[-2] * ... * arr[0]]`.
- `tem` will be the product of all elements in `arr`, i.e., `arr[-1] * arr[-2] * ... * arr[0]`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` in reverse order, and `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.**
