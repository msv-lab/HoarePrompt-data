### Reasoning:

The given program's logic is flawed. Let's break down the issues step-by-step:

1. **Order of Operations**:
   - The problem requires computing the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` before removing any elements based on the command.
   - The current implementation first constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the commands and then calculates the cumulative product modulo `m` in reverse order.
   - This approach incorrectly changes the order of operations, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Cumulative Product Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the cumulative product modulo `m` in reverse order, which means it processes the commands in reverse order, not as specified.
   - It should calculate the cumulative product modulo `m` while processing the commands in the original order.

3. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - Calculating the product of all elements modulo `m` repeatedly can be inefficient, especially given the constraints.
   - A more efficient approach would be to maintain a running product and adjust it as elements are removed from the array based on the commands.

### Correct Approach:
- Initialize a variable to store the cumulative product modulo `m`.
- Iterate through the commands in the original order.
- For each command, compute the remainder of the current product modulo `m` and append it to the result list.
- Update the product by removing the appropriate element (leftmost or rightmost) and adjusting the product accordingly.

### Conclusion:
Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
