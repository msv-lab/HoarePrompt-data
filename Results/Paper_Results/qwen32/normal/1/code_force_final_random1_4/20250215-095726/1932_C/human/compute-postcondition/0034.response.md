The code snippet `ans.append(p)` appends the value of `p` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially `[p, p]`. After appending `p`, `ans` becomes `[p, p, p]`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`b` contains at least one element, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `ans` is `[p, p, p]`, `p` is `((p * v) % m)`, `v` is `v_next`**.

This means that the list `ans` now contains three elements, all of which are `p`. All other variables retain their initial values.
