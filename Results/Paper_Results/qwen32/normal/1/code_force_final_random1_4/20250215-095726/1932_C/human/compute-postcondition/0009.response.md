The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `r` is `n - 1`, after the decrement, `r` will be `n - 2`.

Here are the updated and unchanged variables:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains at least 1.
- `m` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4.
- `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
- `b` remains a list containing the last element of `a`.
- `l` remains 0.
- `r` is now `n - 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing the last element of `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`.**
