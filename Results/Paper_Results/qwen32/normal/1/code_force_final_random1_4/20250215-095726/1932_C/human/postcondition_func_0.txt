The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the directions specified in `s`. Then, it computes a list `ans` of cumulative products of elements in `b` taken modulo `m`, and returns this list in reverse order.
