The given code snippet sets the variable `dp` to `True`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `dp` is now `True`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tc` must be at least 2; `n` is the integer read from the input; `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end; `i` is `n-1`; `dp` is `True`.**
