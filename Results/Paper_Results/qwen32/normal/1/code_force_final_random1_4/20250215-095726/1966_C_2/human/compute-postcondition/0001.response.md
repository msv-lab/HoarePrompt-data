To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition `tc > 0`. The loop will execute if `tc` is greater than 0.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `tc` is an input integer.

We need to ensure that `tc` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

### Analysis:
- The variable `t` is not part of the loop condition and thus does not need to be adjusted.
- The variable `tc` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
To make sure the loop executes at least once, `tc` must be greater than 0. Since `tc` is an input integer, we need to specify that it should be greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tc` must be greater than 0**
