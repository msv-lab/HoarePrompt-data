The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is equal to `tc`, which is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2 and `n` remains `tc` (which is at least 3).

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tc` is at least 3; `n` is `tc`; `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end; `i` is 2; `dp` is `True`.**
