The code snippet processes an input string of integers, removes duplicates, sorts them in descending order, and appends a `0` to the end of the list.

- `arr` is assigned a new value which is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end.
- `t`, `tc`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `tc` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.

After executing the code:
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tc` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end.**
