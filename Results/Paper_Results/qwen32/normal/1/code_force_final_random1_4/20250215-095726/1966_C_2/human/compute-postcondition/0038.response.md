To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

We know:
- `i` is currently `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` is the length of `arr` minus one and must be greater than 1.

Since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, the loop will terminate when `i` reaches `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented from its current value (`n-1`) to `n`, but this would cause the loop to terminate because the range is exclusive of `n`.

However, if we consider the state just before the loop terminates, `i` should be the last valid value within the range, which is `n-1`. But since we are asked to determine the state for the loop to execute one more time, it implies we need to consider the state right before `i` becomes `n-1`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `n-2` (the value before `n-1`).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `n-2`.
- `n` remains the same as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `tc` is at least 1, `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `n-2`, `dp` is `arr[i] > 1 or not dp`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus one and must be greater than 1**
