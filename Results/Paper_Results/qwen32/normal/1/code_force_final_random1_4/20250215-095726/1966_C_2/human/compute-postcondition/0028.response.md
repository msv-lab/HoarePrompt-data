Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tc` is at least 1; `n` is `tc`; `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end; `i` is `n-2`; `dp` is `True` if `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1` or if any previous condition caused `dp` to become `False` and remained `False` until the end, otherwise `dp` is `False`.**

Explanation: The value of `tc` is decremented by 1, so it is now at least 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
