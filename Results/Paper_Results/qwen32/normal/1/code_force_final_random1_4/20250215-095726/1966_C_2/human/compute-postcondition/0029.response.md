To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head. The loop condition is `tc > 0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `tc` is at least 1
- `n` is `tc`
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end
- `i` is `n-2`
- `dp` is `True` if `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1` or if any previous condition caused `dp` to become `False` and remained `False` until the end, otherwise `dp` is `False`

The only variable in the loop head is `tc`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must be greater than 0. Since it is given that `tc` is at least 1, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `tc` is at least 1; `n` is `tc`; `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end; `i` is `n-2`; `dp` is `True` if `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1` or if any previous condition caused `dp` to become `False` and remained `False` until the end, otherwise `dp` is `False`**
