To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

The given `for` loop is:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute if the range `(1, n)` is non-empty, meaning `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` is initialized to 1 and increments up to (but does not include) `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `tc` is at least 1
- `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end
- `i` is `n-2`
- `dp` is `True`
- `n` is the length of `arr` minus one

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `n` is greater than 1. Since `n` is defined as the length of `arr` minus one, this means `arr` must have at least 2 elements.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 1, which means `arr` must have at least 2 elements.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `tc` is at least 1, `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, with a `0` appended at the end and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `n-2`, `dp` is `True`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus one and must be greater than 1**
