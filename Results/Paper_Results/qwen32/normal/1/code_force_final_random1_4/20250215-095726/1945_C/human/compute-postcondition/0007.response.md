Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5 and `n` is odd; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n / 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `pk` is calculated as `n / 2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
