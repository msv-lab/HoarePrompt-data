Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `pk`:**
   - The variable `pk` is calculated as `n / 2` regardless of whether `n` is even or odd. This is correct mathematically, but the comment suggests a different intention. However, the main issue is not here, but rather in how the percentages are calculated and compared.

2. **Percentage Calculation:**
   - The code calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` using integer division and multiplication by 100, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. Instead, the problem requires checking if the counts meet the criteria of at least half the residents being satisfied on each side, which can be done directly without converting to percentages.

3. **Logic for Checking Conditions:**
   - The conditions `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50` are not appropriate. Instead, you need to check if the number of zeros on the left side is at least `ceil(i / 2)` and the number of ones on the right side is at least `ceil((n - i) / 2)`. The current implementation does not correctly handle these conditions.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not correctly handle the edge cases where the road could be placed before the first house or after the last house. Specifically, it does not check if placing the road at position `0` or `n` would satisfy the conditions.

5. **Finding the Minimum Position:**
   - The logic for finding the minimum position is flawed. It should find the position that minimizes `abs(pk - ele)` and then break ties by choosing the smallest position.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    import math
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        o = s.count('1')
        z = s.count('0')
        (zero, one) = (0, 0)
        best_pos = None
        min_diff = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n + 1):  # i goes from 0 to n inclusive
            if i > 0 and s[i - 1] == '0':
                zero += 1
            elif i > 0 and s[i - 1] == '1':
                one += 1
            
            if zero >= math.ceil(i / 2) and (o - one) >= math.ceil((n - i) / 2):
                diff = abs(n / 2 - i)
                if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and i < best_pos):
                    min_diff = diff
                    best_pos = i
        
        print(best_pos)

func()
```

This corrected version properly checks the conditions for each possible position of the road and finds the optimal position according to the problem statement.
