The code appends the current value of `elem` to the list `final`. The values of `mini` and `lst` remain unchanged, while `final` now contains the value of `elem`.

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a list containing `elem`; `lst` contains at least one element; the current value of `elem` satisfies `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**
