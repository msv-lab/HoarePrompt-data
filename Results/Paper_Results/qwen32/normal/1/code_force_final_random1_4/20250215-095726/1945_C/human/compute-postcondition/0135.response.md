Output State: **`mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is [0]; `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and its current value is greater than or equal to 50.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `final` now contains one element, which is `0`. The values of `mini` and `c1` remain unchanged.
