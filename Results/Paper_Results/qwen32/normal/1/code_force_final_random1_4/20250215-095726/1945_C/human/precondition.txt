t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n and a string a, representing the number of houses and the preferences of the residents respectively, such that 3 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
