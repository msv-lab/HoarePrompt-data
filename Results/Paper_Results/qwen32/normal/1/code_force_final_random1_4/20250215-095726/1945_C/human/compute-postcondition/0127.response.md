The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst` and the variable `elem`. Since `elem` is the next element in `lst`, at the start of the next iteration, `elem` should be the subsequent element in `lst`.

Given that `lst` contains at least one element and `elem` is the next element in `lst` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must still have more elements left to iterate over. Therefore, `elem` should be updated to the next element in `lst`.

Let's denote the current `elem` as `elem_prev`. The next `elem` (let's call it `elem_next`) would be the next element in `lst` after `elem_prev`.

State: **`mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, `final` is a list containing all previous elements in `final` plus the newly appended `elem`. Otherwise, `final` remains unchanged. `lst` contains at least one element, and `elem` is the next element in `lst` after `elem_prev`.**

Since we don't have the specific value of `elem_prev` or the exact structure of `lst`, we can only describe the state in terms of the next element in `lst`:

State: **`mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, `final` is a list containing all previous elements in `final` plus the newly appended `elem`. Otherwise, `final` remains unchanged. `lst` contains at least one element, and `elem` is the next element in `lst`.**
