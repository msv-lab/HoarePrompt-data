Postcondition: **`mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `len(final)` is 0, then `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is set to `[0]`. Otherwise, `final` is set to a list containing `n`. If `len(final)` is not 0, `final` remains a sorted list containing all elements `elem` from `lst` such that `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**
