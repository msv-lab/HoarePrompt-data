Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from meeting the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `pk`**: The variable `pk` is calculated as `n / 2` regardless of whether `n` is even or odd. This is incorrect because the problem specifies that `pk` should be the ceiling of `n / 2`. For example, if `n = 3`, `pk` should be `2` (since `ceil(3/2) = 2`), but the code sets `pk` to `1.5`.

2. **Percentage Calculation**: The percentages `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are calculated using integer division and multiplication by 100, which is not appropriate for determining if at least half of the residents are satisfied. Instead, the code should directly compare counts to their respective thresholds (`ceil(i/2)` for the left side and `ceil((n-i)/2)` for the right side).

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not handle the cases where the road could be placed before the first house or after the last house. Specifically, it does not check if placing the road before the first house (i.e., `i = 0`) or after the last house (i.e., `i = n`) satisfies the conditions.

4. **Logic for Determining Valid Positions**: The logic for determining valid positions `lst` is flawed. It uses percentage checks which are not accurate as explained above. Additionally, it does not correctly handle the case where no valid position is found in the loop, leading to incorrect results.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        pk = math.ceil(n / 2)
        zero, one = 0, 0
        valid_positions = []
        min_diff = float('inf')
        
        # Check if placing the road before the first house is valid
        if s.count('1') >= math.ceil(n / 2):
            valid_positions.append(0)
            min_diff = abs(0 - pk)
        
        # Check for valid positions between houses
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            
            if zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2) and one >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                diff = abs(i + 1 - pk)
                if diff < min_diff:
                    valid_positions = [i + 1]
                    min_diff = diff
                elif diff == min_diff:
                    valid_positions.append(i + 1)
        
        # Check if placing the road after the last house is valid
        if s.count('0') >= math.ceil(n / 2):
            if abs(n - pk) < min_diff:
                valid_positions = [n]
            elif abs(n - pk) == min_diff:
                valid_positions.append(n)
        
        print(min(valid_positions))

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the conditions specified in the problem description and ensures that all edge cases are considered.
