To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `final` is a list that is sorted in ascending order.
   - If `len(final)` is 0, `final` remains an empty list.
   - If `len(final)` is 1, `final` contains either `[0]` if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or `[n]` if `c1` is less than 50.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(final[0])
   ```

Given these conditions, we need to consider two cases:

- **Case 1**: `len(final)` is 0.
  - In this case, `final` is an empty list.
  - Accessing `final[0]` would raise an `IndexError` because there are no elements in the list.
  - However, since the problem specifies the behavior only for `len(final)` being 0 or 1, and does not explicitly handle other lengths, we should assume that the scenario where `len(final)` is 0 does not occur in the context of this question. Therefore, we focus on the valid case where `len(final)` is 1.

- **Case 2**: `len(final)` is 1.
  - Here, `final` contains either `[0]` or `[n]` based on the value of `c1`.
  - If `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` contains `[0]`.
  - If `c1` is less than 50, `final` contains `[n]`.

In both sub-cases of `len(final)` being 1, `final[0]` will either be `0` or `n`.

Therefore, the output of `print(final[0])` will be either `0` or `n` depending on the value of `c1`.

Output: **0 or n (where 0 is used if c1 >= 50, and n is used if c1 < 50)**
