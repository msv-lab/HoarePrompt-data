The given code snippet calculates the `one_perc` variable based on the counts of '1's and '0's in the string `s`. Here's the updated state after executing the code:

The variable `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. However, the variable `one` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot compute a specific value for `one_perc`. Assuming `one` is intended to be a variable representing some count of '1's, let's denote it as `one` for now.

Since `one` is not defined, we can't provide a specific numerical value for `one_perc`. But we can express it in terms of the variables provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `lst` is an empty list; `mini` is 100000000; `zero_perc` is `(zero * 100) // (i + 1)`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**
