The code snippet `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. This means that the list `final` will now contain the element `elem` in addition to whatever elements it already contained.

Given the initial state, the variable `final` was described as a list that could potentially contain elements where `abs(pk - elem) == mini` for some `elem` in `lst`. After executing `final.append(elem)`, the list `final` will definitely include `elem`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list containing indices where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, and `lst` must have at least one element; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a list that includes `elem` and possibly other elements where `abs(pk - elem) == mini` for some `elem` in `lst`; `elem` is `next_elem` where `next_elem` is the next element in `lst` to be processed.**
