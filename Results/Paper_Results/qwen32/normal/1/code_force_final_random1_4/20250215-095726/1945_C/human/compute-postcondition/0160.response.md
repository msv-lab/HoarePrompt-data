The code snippet calculates `one_perc` using the formula `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. Here's the updated state of the variables after the code is executed:

- `mini` remains 100000000.
- `final` remains a list determined by the conditions given (either `[0]` or a list of elements from `lst`).
- `c1` remains calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0.
- `n` remains an input integer greater than 1.
- `s` remains an input string.
- `pk` remains `n / 2`.
- `_` remains incremented by 1.
- `sl` remains a list of characters from `s`.
- `o` remains the count of '1's in `sl`.
- `z` remains the count of '0's in `sl` with at least one additional '0' counted if the current character `s[i]` is '0'.
- `zero` remains 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` remains 0.
- `one` remains 1 if the current character `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `one` remains 0.
- `lst` remains an empty list.
- `zero_perc` remains `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`.
- `one_perc` is now calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.

Output State: **`mini` is 100000000; `final` is a list determined by the conditions given (either `[0]` or a list of elements from `lst`); `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `_` is incremented by 1; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` with at least one additional '0' counted if the current character `s[i]` is '0'; `zero` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0; `one` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list; `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**.
