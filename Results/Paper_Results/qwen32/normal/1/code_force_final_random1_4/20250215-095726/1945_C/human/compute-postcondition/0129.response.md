Postcondition: **`mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, `final` is a list containing all previous elements in `final` plus the newly appended `elem`. Otherwise, `final` remains unchanged. `lst` contains at least one element, and `elem` is the next element in `lst`.**
