The code snippet initializes two new variables `zero` and `one` to 0. None of the existing variables (`mini`, `final`, `c1`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `_`, `sl`, `o`, `z`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a list determined by the conditions given (either `[0]` or a list of elements from `lst`); `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `_` is incremented by 1; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0.**
