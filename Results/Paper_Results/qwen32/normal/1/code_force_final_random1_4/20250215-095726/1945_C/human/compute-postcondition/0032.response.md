The code snippet appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. This means that the list `lst` will now contain an additional element which is the current value of `i + 1`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `lst`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, and now also contains `i + 1`; `mini` is 100000000; `zero_perc` is `(zero * 100) // (i + 1)`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`; `i` is `i + 1`; `zero` is `zero + 1` if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `one` is `one + 1`.**
