The code snippet appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. None of the other variables are modified by this operation.

Output State: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(n / 2 - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `final` is `[elem]`, `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `_` is incremented by 1, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`, `zero` is the total count of '0's encountered in the loop, `one` is the total count of '1's encountered in the loop, `lst` contains at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were greater than or equal to 50%, and `elem` is such that `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**

In simpler terms, the list `final` now contains the element `elem`, while all other variables retain their original values.
