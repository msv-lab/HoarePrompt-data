To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variable `ele` since it is the only variable in the loop head of the given `for` loop:

```python
for ele in lst:
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `ele` was set to `ele_next`. For the next iteration, `ele` should take the next value from the list `lst`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `ele`.
2. **Determine the Next Value for `ele`**: Since `ele` iterates over `lst`, the next value of `ele` should be the next element in `lst` after `ele_next`.

Given that `ele` was `ele_next` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `ele` will be the subsequent element in `lst` if there is one.

### Adjusting the State:
- **`ele`**: This needs to be updated to the next element in `lst` after `ele_next`.

Since we don't have specific values for `lst` or `ele_next`, we'll denote the next element in `lst` after `ele_next` as `next_ele`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 1; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is a string such that `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both at least 50 (e.g., `s = "0101"`); `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in `s`; `zero` is the count of '0's in `s` up to the second last character; `one` is the count of '1's in `s` up to the second last character; `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1` for each index `i` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50; `mini` is `min(mini, abs(pk - ele))`; `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, then `final` is an empty list. If `c1` (which is the integer value of `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, then `final` contains `[0]`. Otherwise, `final` contains `[n]`; `ele` is `next_ele`**.
