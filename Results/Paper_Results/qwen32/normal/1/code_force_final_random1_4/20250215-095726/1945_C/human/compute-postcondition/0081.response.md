The given code snippet resets the variables `zero` and `one` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the newly input string; `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in `s`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is a list containing indices where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, then `final` is an empty list. If `c1` (which is the integer value of `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, then `final` contains `[0]`. Otherwise, `final` contains `[n]`.**
