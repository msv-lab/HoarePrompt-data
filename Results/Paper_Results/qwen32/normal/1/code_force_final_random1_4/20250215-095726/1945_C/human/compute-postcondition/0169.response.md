Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's determine the output state.

The code snippet modifies the value of `one_perc` based on the current values of `o`, `one`, `n`, and `i`.

Here's the breakdown of the impact of the code:

- `one_perc` is recalculated using the formula `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.
- The other variables (`mini`, `final`, `c1`, `s`, `pk`, `_`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `lst`, `zero_perc`) remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code snippet, which they are not in this case.

Let's express the new value of `one_perc` in terms of the existing variables:
- `one_perc` is now `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 4 - 1)` which simplifies to `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 5)`.

Since the exact values of `o`, `one`, and `n` are not specified, we can only express `one_perc` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`mini` is 100000000; `final` is a list determined by the conditions given (either `[0]` or a list of elements from `lst`); `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `_` is incremented by 1; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` with at least one additional '0' counted if the current character `s[i]` is '0'; `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` remains the same; `one` is set to 1 if `s[i]` is '0', and set to 2 if `s[i]` is not '0'; `lst` is `[i + 1]` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains unchanged; `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 5`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 5)`; `i` is 4.**
