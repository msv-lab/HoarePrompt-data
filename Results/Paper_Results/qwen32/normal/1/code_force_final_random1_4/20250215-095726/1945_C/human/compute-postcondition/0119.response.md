The code snippet reassigns the variable `final` to an empty list. This means that the previous contents of `final` (which was a sorted list of elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between each element and `pk` equals `mini`) are discarded.

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is an empty list.**
