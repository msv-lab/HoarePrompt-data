The code assigns the value of `n / 2` to the variable `pk`. Given that `n` is an even integer between 3 and 300,000, `pk` will be an integer value representing half of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5 and `n` is even; `a` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n / 2`.**
