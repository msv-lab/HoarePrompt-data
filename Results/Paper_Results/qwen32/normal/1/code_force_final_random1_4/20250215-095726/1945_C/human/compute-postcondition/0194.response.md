The code snippet `final.append(elem)` modifies the `final` list by adding the `elem` element to it. Given the initial state, `final` initially contains `[elem]` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini` and is `[]` otherwise. After appending `elem` to `final`, `final` will contain `elem` regardless of its previous state.

Hereâ€™s the updated output state:

Output State: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(n / 2 - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is `[elem]` (if it was empty before, it now contains one `elem`, and if it already contained `elem`, it now contains two `elem`s); `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `_` is incremented by 1, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`, `zero` is the total count of '0's encountered in the loop, `one` is the total count of '1's encountered in the loop, and `lst` contains at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were greater than or equal to 50%, `elem` is `next_elem`.**
