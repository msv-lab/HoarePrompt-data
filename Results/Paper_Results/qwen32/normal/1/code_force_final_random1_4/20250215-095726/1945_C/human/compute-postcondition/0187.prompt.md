Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mini` is 100000000; `final` is a list determined by the conditions given (either `[0]` or a list of elements from `lst`); `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `_` is incremented by 1; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` is the total count of '0's encountered in the loop; `one` is the total count of '1's encountered in the loop; `lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were greater than or equal to 50%.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is the minimum of `100000000` and `abs(n / 2 - ele)`, `final` is a list determined by the conditions given (either `[0]` or a list of elements from `lst`), `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `_` is incremented by 1, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`, `zero` is the total count of '0's encountered in the loop, `one` is the total count of '1's encountered in the loop, `lst` contains at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mini` is the minimum of `100000000` and `abs(n / 2 - ele)`, and `abs(pk - ele)`, `final` is a list determined by the conditions given (either `[0]` or a list of elements from `lst`), `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `_` is incremented by 1, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`, `zero` is the total count of '0's encountered in the loop, `one` is the total count of '1's encountered in the loop, `lst` contains at least one element, and `ele` is the next element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mini` is the minimum of `100000000`, `abs(n / 2 - ele)`, `abs(pk - ele)`, `abs(pk - ele)`; `abs(pk - ele)` is recalculated as the minimum; `final` is a list determined by the conditions given (either `[0]` or a list of elements from `lst`); `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` if `len(final)` was 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `pk` is `n / 2`; `_` is incremented by 1; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`; `zero` is the total count of '0's encountered in the loop; `one` is the total count of '1's encountered in the loop; `lst` contains at least one element; and `ele` is the next element in `lst`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
