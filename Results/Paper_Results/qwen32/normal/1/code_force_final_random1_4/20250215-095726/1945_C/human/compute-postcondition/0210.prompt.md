Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        pk = n / 2
    else:
        pk = n / 2
    sl = list(s)
    o = sl.count('1')
    z = sl.count('0')
    zero, one = 0, 0
    lst = []
    mini = pow(10, 8)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == '0':
            zero += 1
        else:
            one += 1
        zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
        one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
        if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
            lst.append(i + 1)
    for ele in lst:
        mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
    final = []
    for elem in lst:
        if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
            final.append(elem)
    final.sort()
    if len(final) == 0:
        c1 = o * 100 // n
        if c1 >= 50:
            final.append(0)
        else:
            final.append(n)
    print(final[0])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the input string; `pk` is `n / 2` if `n` is even, and `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list containing indices where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, then `final` is an empty list. If `c1` (which is the integer value of `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, then `final` contains `[0]`. Otherwise, `final` contains `[n]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mini` is the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `len(final)` is 0, then `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is set to `[0]`. Otherwise, `final` is set to a list containing `n`. If `len(final)` is not 0, `final` remains a sorted list containing all elements `elem` from `lst` such that `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `final` is sorted in ascending order. If `len(final)` is 0, then `final` remains an empty list. If `len(final)` is 1, `final` contains either `[0]` if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or `[n]` if `c1` is less than 50.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
