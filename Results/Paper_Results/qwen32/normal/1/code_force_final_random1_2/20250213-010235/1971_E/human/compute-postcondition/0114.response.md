To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. `q` is greater than 0.
2. `m` is 0.
3. `i` is 1.
4. `ql` is an input integer.
5. `s` is an integer between 0 and the length of `a`.
6. The element at index `s` in `a` is equal to the previous value of `ql`.
7. `l` is 0.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(b[s], end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `s` is an index in the list `a`.
- The element at index `s` in `a` is equal to the previous value of `ql`.
- We need to find out what `b[s]` is.

However, the initial state does not provide any information about the list `b` or its elements. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `b[s]` from the given information. 

Given this, the best we can do is to describe the output in terms of the value at index `s` in the list `b`.

Output: **b[s] (where b[s] is the element at index s in the list b)**
