Postcondition: **`q` is greater than 0; `m` is 0; `i` is 1; `ql` is an input integer; `s` is an integer between 0 and the length of `a`; the element at index `s` in `a` is equal to the previous value of `ql`; `l` is 1. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
