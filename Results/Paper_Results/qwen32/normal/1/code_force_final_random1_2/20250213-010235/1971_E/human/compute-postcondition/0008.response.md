The given code appends the difference between the current element and the previous element of list `a` to the list `ad`. Given the initial state, `ad` initially contains a single element `0`. After executing the line `ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])`, `ad` will contain two elements: the initial `0` and the newly appended difference `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is `0` and `a[1:]` contains at least one integer, `b` is a list where `b[0]` is `0` and `b[1:]` contains the integers read from the input, `ad` is a list containing two elements `[0, a[i] - a[i - 1]]`, `bd` is a list containing a single element `0`**.
