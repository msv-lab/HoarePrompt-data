To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and how they contribute to the value of `m`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `l` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is the first input integer (length of the lists `a` and `b`).
   - `k` is the second input integer (number of queries).
   - `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the first input line.
   - `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the second input line.
   - `ad` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `a` (starting with 0).
   - `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b` (starting with 0).
   - `v` is a list of ratios `ad[i] / bd[i]` (starting with 0).

2. **Query-Specific Variables:**
   - `q` is the newly input integer (the query).
   - `s` is the index where `q` would fit in the sorted list `a`.
   - `ql` is the difference between `q` and `a[s - 1]`.
   - `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`.
   - `t` is decremented by 1 (though `t` is not used in the calculation of `m`).

### Calculation of `m`:
- `s` is determined by finding the correct position of `q` in the sorted list `a`.
- `ql` is calculated as `q - a[s - 1]`.
- `m` is then calculated using the formula `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`.

### Explanation of the Print Statement:
The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer value of `m` followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Given the above calculations, the value of `m` is derived from the specific values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]` based on the query `q` and the lists `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the output will be the integer value of `m` calculated from the formula, followed by a space.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s]))**
