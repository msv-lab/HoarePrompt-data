To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand the relevant variables and their relationships:

1. **List `v`**: 
   - Starts with 0.
   - Followed by the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Variable `q`**: 
   - Greater than 0.

3. **Variable `m`**: 
   - Defined as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.

4. **Variable `i`**: 
   - Set to 1.

5. **Variable `ql`**: 
   - Initially some value.
   - Modified by subtracting `a[s - 1]` from it.

6. **Variable `s`**: 
   - The index where `ql` (before modification) should be inserted into the sorted list `a`.
   - If `a[s]` is equal to `ql` (before modification), `a[s]` remains unchanged.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(int(m), end=' ')
```

We need to determine the value of `m` and convert it to an integer before printing it.

### Analysis of `m`:
- `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- To find the exact value of `m`, we need to know the values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]`.

Since the specific values of `b`, `bd`, `ql`, and `ad` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`. However, we can express `m` in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the integer value of `m`, which is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.

Output: **int(m) (where m = b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s])**
