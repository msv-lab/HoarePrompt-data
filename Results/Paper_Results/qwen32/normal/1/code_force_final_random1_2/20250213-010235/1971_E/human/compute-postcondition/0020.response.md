To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `bd` list. The loop iterates from `1` to `len(b) - 1`, appending the difference between consecutive elements of `b` to the `bd` list.

Given the pattern observed in the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can generalize that after the loop completes, `bd` will contain the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `b`. Specifically, `bd` will be `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]]`.

Thus, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is `0` and `a[1:]` contains the integers read from the input; `b` is a list where `b[0]` is `0` and `b[1:]` contains the integers read from the input; `ad` is a list containing `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]]`; `bd` is a list containing `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]]`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `bd` will have been populated with the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in the list `b`, starting with a `0` at the beginning. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, and `ad`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
