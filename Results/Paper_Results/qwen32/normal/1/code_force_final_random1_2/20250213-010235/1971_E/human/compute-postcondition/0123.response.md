The code snippet provided is `i = 1`. This line reassigns the value of `i` to 1. However, since `i` was already initialized to 1 in the initial state, the value of `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0; `m` is 0; `i` is 1; `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`; `s` is an integer between 0 and the length of `a`; the element at index `s` in `a` is equal to the previous value of `ql`; `l` is 1**.
