Postcondition: **`v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`; `q` is greater than 0; `m` is 0; `i` is 1; `ql` is an input integer; `s` is the index where `ql` should be inserted into the sorted list `a`. Additionally, if `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, then `a[s]` remains equal to `ql`.**
