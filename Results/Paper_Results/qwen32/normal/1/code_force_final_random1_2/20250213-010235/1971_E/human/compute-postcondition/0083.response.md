To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the length of `b`.

Here's the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `v` is a list starting with 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `q` is the third integer from the input.
- `l` is the previous value of `q` before the new assignment.
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input.
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by at least one more integer.
- `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences `a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`.
- `bd` is a list containing 0 and `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.

The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, to proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again.

Let's denote the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_current`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_current + 1`.

Given that the loop runs from `1` to `len(b) - 1`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the incremented value of `i`.

State: **`v` is a list starting with 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `q` is the third integer from the input, `l` is the previous value of `q` before the new assignment, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by at least one more integer, `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences `a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`, `bd` is a list containing 0 and `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since `i` was `i_current` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_current + 1`.

Therefore, if we assume `i_current` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`v` is a list starting with 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `q` is the third integer from the input, `l` is the previous value of `q` before the new assignment, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by at least one more integer, `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences `a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`, `bd` is a list containing 0 and `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `i` is `i_current + 1`**.

Given that `i_current` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and assuming `i_current` was `x`, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`v` is a list starting with 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `q` is the third integer from the input, `l` is the previous value of `q` before the new assignment, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by at least one more integer, `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences `a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`, `bd` is a list containing 0 and `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `i` is `x + 1`**.

Since the exact value of `i_current` (or `x`) is not specified, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`v` is a list starting with 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `q` is the third integer from the input, `l` is the previous value of `q` before the new assignment, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by at least one more integer, `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences `a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`, `bd` is a list containing 0 and `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`v` is a list starting with 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `q` is the third integer from the input, `l` is the previous value of `q` before the new assignment, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by at least one more integer, `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences `a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`, `bd` is a list containing 0 and `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
