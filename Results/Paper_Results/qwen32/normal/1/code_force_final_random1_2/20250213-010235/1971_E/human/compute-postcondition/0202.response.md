Output State: **All test cases have been processed, and for each test case, all queries have been answered. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, and `v` reflect the current test case's data, while `l` is `-1` indicating no more queries are left in the current test case.**

### Explanation:
- **All test cases have been processed**: The loop has iterated `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided initially.
- **For each test case, all queries have been answered**: Within each test case, there are `q` queries, and all these queries have been processed and their results printed.
- **Variables reflecting the current test case's data**: After all test cases are processed, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, and `v` will hold the data of the last test case processed.
- **`l` is `-1`**: This indicates that all queries for the current test case have been processed (`l` would have cycled through `0` to `q-1` for each test case). Since there are no more queries left in the current test case, `l` is set to `-1`.
