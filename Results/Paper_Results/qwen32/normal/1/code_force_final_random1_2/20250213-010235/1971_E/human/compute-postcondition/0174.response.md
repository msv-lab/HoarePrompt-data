Given the initial state and the operation to be performed, we need to determine the new value of `m` after executing the line `m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.

Here's the breakdown:

- `m` is initially set to `b[s - 1]`.
- `ql` is the newly input integer minus `a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index where the newly input integer (`q`) would fit in the sorted list `a`.
- `ad` is the list of differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting with 0.
- `bd` is the list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`, starting with 0.
- `v` is the list of ratios of corresponding elements of `ad` and `bd`, starting with 0.

The operation `m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]` modifies `m` by adding the product of `bd[s]`, `ql`, and the reciprocal of `ad[s]`.

After the operation, the new value of `m` will be `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `i` is 1, `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`, `ql` is the newly input integer minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where the newly input integer would fit in the sorted list `a`, `q` is the newly input integer, `t` is `t-1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `a` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `b` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `bd` is `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b)-2]]`, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, then `a[s]` remains equal to `ql`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `l` remains 0, `i` remains 1, `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`, `ql` remains the newly input integer minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` remains the index where the newly input integer would fit in the sorted list `a`, `q` remains the newly input integer, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` remains the first input integer, `k` remains the second input integer, `a` remains the list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `b` remains the list `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `ad` remains the list `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `bd` remains the list `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b)-2]]`, `v` remains the list `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1]]`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, then `a[s]` remains equal to `ql`.
