To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and how the variables are defined:

1. **Variables Initialization**:
   - `l` is initialized to 1.
   - `i` is initialized to 1.
   - `q` is a newly input integer.
   - `t` is initially set to some value but then decremented by 1 (`t = t - 1`).
   - `n` is the first input integer.
   - `k` is the second input integer.
   - `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from an input split into a list of integers.
   - `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from another input split into a list of integers.
   - `ad` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting with 0.
   - `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting with 0.
   - `v` is a list of ratios `ad[i] / bd[i]` starting with 0.

2. **Variable `m` Calculation**:
   - `m` is updated using the formula `m = m + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`.
   - `ql` is updated using the formula `ql = ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` after the `bisect_left` operation.

However, the exact values of `m`, `ql`, and `s` are not explicitly given in the initial state. They depend on the input values and the operations performed before the `print` statement. Since the exact values are not provided, we can only describe `m` in terms of these operations.

Given this information, the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer value of `m` followed by a space.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as m + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s]))**
