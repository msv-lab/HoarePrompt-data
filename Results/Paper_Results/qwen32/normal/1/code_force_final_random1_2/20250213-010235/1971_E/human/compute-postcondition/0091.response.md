To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the range it iterates over (`len(a)`).

Here's the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `v` is `[0, ad[i] / bd[i]]`
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `k` is the second integer from the input
- `q` is the third integer from the input
- `l` is the previous value of `q` before the new assignment
- `a` is a list starting with `0` followed by at least one more integer from the input
- `b` is a list starting with `0` followed by integers from the new input
- `ad` is a list containing `0` and the differences `a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`
- `bd` is a list containing `0` and the differences `b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]`

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was used to compute `v` as `[0, ad[i] / bd[i]]`. To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, provided that it remains within the bounds specified by the range `(1, len(a))`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

1. Increment `i` by 1.
2. Ensure that `i` is still less than `len(a)` for the loop to continue executing.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`v` is `[0, ad[i] / bd[i]]`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `q` is the third integer from the input; `l` is the previous value of `q` before the new assignment; `a` is a list starting with `0` followed by at least one more integer from the input; `b` is a list starting with `0` followed by integers from the new input; `ad` is a list containing `0` and the differences `a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`; `bd` is a list containing `0` and the differences `b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]`; `i` is `i + 1`**

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we express the new state in terms of `i + 1`. However, we ensure that `i + 1 < len(a)` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the final adjusted state is:
State: **`v` is `[0, ad[i] / bd[i]]`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `q` is the third integer from the input; `l` is the previous value of `q` before the new assignment; `a` is a list starting with `0` followed by at least one more integer from the input; `b` is a list starting with `0` followed by integers from the new input; `ad` is a list containing `0` and the differences `a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`; `bd` is a list containing `0` and the differences `b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]`; `i` is `i + 1` where `i + 1 < len(a)`**
