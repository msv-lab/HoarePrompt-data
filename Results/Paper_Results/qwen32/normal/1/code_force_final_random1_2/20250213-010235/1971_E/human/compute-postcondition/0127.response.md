Output State: **`q` is greater than 0; `m` is 0; `i` is 1; `ql` is an input integer; `s` is an integer between 0 and the length of `a`; the element at index `s` in `a` is equal to the previous value of `ql`; `l` is 1; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop without changing the values of any variables. Thus, all the variables retain their previous values, and the loop continues.
