The code snippet `i = 1` sets the value of `i` to 1. Since `i` was already 1 according to the initial state, its value does not change. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 0; `m` is 0; `i` is 1; `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`; `s` is an integer between 0 and the length of `a`; the element at index `s` in `a` is equal to `ql`; `l` is 0**
