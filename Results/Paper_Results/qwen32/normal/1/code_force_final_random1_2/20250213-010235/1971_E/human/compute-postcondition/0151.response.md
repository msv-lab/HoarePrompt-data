The code appends the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. This means the length of `bd` increases by one, and the new element added is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `bd`, which now includes an additional element. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is `q-1`, `i` is `len(a)`, `m` is the sum of all calculated `m` values from each iteration, `ql` is the value read in the last iteration, `s` is the index found in the last iteration, `q` is the newly input integer, `t` is `t-1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `a` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`, `b` is a list with at least `len(a) + 1` elements, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `bd` is `[0, b[i] - b[i - 1]]` plus the new element `b[i] - b[i - 1]` appended to it.**
