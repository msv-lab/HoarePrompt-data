`ql` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `v`, `q`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`; `q` must be greater than 0; `m` is 0; `i` is 1; `ql` is an input integer**.
