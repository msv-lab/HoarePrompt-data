The given code snippet only modifies the variable `end` when `t` is equal to 1. Since the code does not specify any condition for `t`, we assume it is equal to 1 for the changes to take effect. Here's the updated state:

- `end` is set to the value of `v`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `t` is the first integer from the input; `v` is the second integer from the input; `start` is `v` if `start < v`, otherwise `start` remains unchanged; `end` is `v`; `num` is `[v]` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` remains `[]`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `t` is not equal to 1, none of these changes occur.**
