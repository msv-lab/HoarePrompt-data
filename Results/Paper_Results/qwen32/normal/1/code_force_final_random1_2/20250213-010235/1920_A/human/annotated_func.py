#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value indicating whether to return a fixed value of 1 or to read an integer input.

        #The program returns an integer input by the user
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. Depending on the value of `isOne`, it either returns 1 if `isOne` is `True`, or it returns an integer input by the user if `isOne` is `False`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean indicating whether the input line should be split into multiple items, and to_int is a boolean indicating whether the items should be converted to integers.
def func_2(space, to_int):
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: `space` is a boolean, `to_int` is a boolean, `line` is the input string, and `items` is a list. If `space` is True, `items` is a list of substrings from `line` split by whitespace. If `space` is False, `items` is a list of characters from `line`.

        #The program returns a list where each element from `items` (which are substrings if `space` is True or characters if `space` is False) has been converted to an integer.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns `items`, which is a list of substrings from `line` split by whitespace if `space` is True, or a list of characters from `line` if `space` is False. Since `to_int` is False, no conversion to integers occurs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an input line and processes it based on the boolean parameters `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is True, it splits the line into substrings separated by whitespace; if `space` is False, it splits the line into individual characters. If `to_int` is True, each element in the resulting list is converted to an integer. If `to_int` is False, the elements remain as strings.

    #State: a string that is the concatenation of all elements in `arr` (each converted to a string) with `sym` appended after each element.
    return string
    #The program returns a string that is the concatenation of all elements in `arr` (each converted to a string) with `sym` appended after each element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list `arr` and a string `sym`, and returns a single string where each element of `arr` (converted to a string) is followed by `sym`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a string, and substring is a string.
def func_4(string, substring):
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)

    #State: string is a string, substring is a string, indices is a list containing all the positions where substring occurs in string, index is -1.
    return indices
    #The program returns a list named 'indices' which contains all the positions where the substring occurs in the string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two strings, `string` and `substring`, and returns a list of all starting positions where `substring` occurs within `string`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements, and element is a value that can be present in arr.
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices from the list `arr` where the value is equal to `element`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list `arr` and a value `element`, and returns a list of indices where `element` appears in `arr`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, index is a non-negative integer, and value is a value of any type such that index is within the bounds of the sublists in arr.
def func_6(arr, index, value):

            return subArray
        
    #State: None.
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` searches through a list of lists (`arr`) for a sublist where the element at the specified `index` matches the given `value`. If such a sublist is found, it returns that sublist. If no such sublist exists, it returns `None`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, start is an integer initialized to -1, end is a float initialized to 1000000000.0, num is a list that will store integers, t is an integer that represents the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3), and v is an integer representing the value associated with the constraint.

                start = v

    if (start > end) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: start is 20, end is 50, num is [100, 200], count_num is 0, and start is less than or equal to end
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #The program returns 31
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` pairs of integers `(t, v)` where `t` indicates the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3) and `v` is the value associated with the constraint. It updates `start` and `end` based on constraints of type 1 and 2, respectively, and collects values of type 3 into a list `num`. After processing all inputs, it calculates the number of integers within the range `[start, end]` that are not in `num` and returns this count if it is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0.
