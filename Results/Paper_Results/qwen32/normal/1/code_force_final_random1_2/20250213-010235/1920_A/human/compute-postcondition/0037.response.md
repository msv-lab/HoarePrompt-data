Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`; `t` is the first integer from the input; `v` is the second integer from the input; `start` is `v` if `start < v`, otherwise `start` remains unchanged; if `t == 2`, `end` is `v` if `end > v`, otherwise `end` remains unchanged; `num` is `[v, v]` if `t` is not equal to 3, and `num` is `[v, v, v]` if `t` is equal to 3; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The list `num` has an additional `v` appended to it. If `t` was not equal to 3, `num` originally contained one `v`, and now contains two `v`s. If `t` was equal to 3, `num` originally contained two `v`s, and now contains three `v`s. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
