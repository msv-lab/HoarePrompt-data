The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `t` and `v`. This means the values of `t` and `v` will be updated based on the input, while other variables remain unchanged unless further operations modify them.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than `i + 2`
- `t` is the first integer from the input
- `v` is the second integer from the input
- `start` is `v` if `start < v`, otherwise `start` remains unchanged
- if `t == 2` and `end > v`, then `end` is set to `v`
- `num` is `[v]` if `t` is not equal to 3, and `num` is `[v, v]` if `t` is equal to 3
- `i` is `i + 1`

After executing the code snippet `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))`, `t` and `v` are reassigned to the new values read from the input. The other conditions and assignments involving `start`, `end`, `num`, and `i` are not affected by this line of code and will be evaluated based on the new values of `t` and `v`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`; `t` is the first integer from the input; `v` is the second integer from the input; `start` is `v` if `start < v`, otherwise `start` remains unchanged; if `t == 2` and `end > v`, then `end` is set to `v`; `num` is `[v]` if `t` is not equal to 3, and `num` is `[v, v]` if `t` is equal to 3; `i` is `i + 1`.**
