The function reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` pairs of integers `(t, v)` where `t` indicates the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3) and `v` is the value associated with the constraint. It updates `start` and `end` based on constraints of type 1 and 2, respectively, and collects values of type 3 into a list `num`. After processing all inputs, it calculates the number of integers within the range `[start, end]` that are not in `num` and returns this count if it is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0.
