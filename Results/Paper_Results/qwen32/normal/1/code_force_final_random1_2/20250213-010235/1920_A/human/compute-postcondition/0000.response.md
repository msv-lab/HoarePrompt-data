The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is already an integer within the range 2 to 100, the new value of `n` will be whatever integer is provided by the user through the input function. The values of the other variables (`start`, `end`, `num`, `t`, and `v`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer provided by the user input, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is a list that will store integers, `t` is an integer that represents the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3), and `v` is an integer representing the value associated with the constraint.**
