The provided code snippet does not actually change the value of `end` since it is already initialized with the same value (`1000000000.0`). Therefore, none of the variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is the integer provided by the user input, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is a list that will store integers, `t` is an integer that represents the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3), and `v` is an integer representing the value associated with the constraint.**
