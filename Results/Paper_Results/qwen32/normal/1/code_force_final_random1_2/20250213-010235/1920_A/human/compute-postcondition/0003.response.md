The code snippet `num = []` reassigns the variable `num` to an empty list. This means that any previous contents of `num` are discarded, and `num` now holds an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is the integer provided by the user input, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is [], `t` is an integer that represents the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3), and `v` is an integer representing the value associated with the constraint.**
