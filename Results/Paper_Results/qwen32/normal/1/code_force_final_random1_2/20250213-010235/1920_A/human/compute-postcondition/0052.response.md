The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any of the variables. Therefore, the values of `start`, `end`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is 20, `end` is 50, `num` is [100, 200]**.
