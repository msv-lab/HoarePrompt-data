You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints.
- Constraints can be of three types:
  1. `k` must be greater than or equal to some integer `x`.
  2. `k` must be less than or equal to some integer `x`.
  3. `k` must not be equal to some integer `x`.
- There will be at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2.
- The solution should handle up to 500 test cases, each with up to 100 constraints.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program reads input and processes each test case as follows:
1. It initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1,000,000,000.
2. For each constraint:
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `start` to be the maximum of its current value and `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `end` to be the minimum of its current value and `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to a list `num`.
3. After processing all constraints, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the count of integers in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` from the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]`.
4. If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0 (indicating no valid `k`).

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of Type 3 Constraints**: The program correctly identifies integers that cannot be `k` and excludes them from the final count. However, it does not account for duplicates in the range `[start, end]`. Since the problem guarantees no two constraints are the same, this should not be an issue.
2. **Range Calculation**: The program calculates the number of valid integers as `end - start + 1 - count_num`. This formula is correct as long as `start <= end`. If `start > end`, it correctly returns 0.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **No Valid `k`**: If `start > end` after processing all constraints, the program correctly returns 0.
   - **All `k` Invalid**: If all integers in the range `[start, end]` are excluded by type 3 constraints, the program correctly returns 0.
   - **Single Valid `k`**: If `start == end` and this integer is not excluded by any type 3 constraint, the program correctly returns 1.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all the provided test cases correctly. It correctly calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints, including edge cases where no valid `k` exists.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles all types of constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It correctly returns 0 when no valid `k` exists and handles large ranges and multiple type 3 constraints appropriately.
