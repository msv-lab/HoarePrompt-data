### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and see if it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases from the input. It correctly handles the input as per the problem description.
   
2. **Function `func_7`:**
   - This function processes each test case. Here's how it works:
     - It reads the number of constraints `n`.
     - It initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1,000,000,000.0 (which is effectively 1,000,000,000 since we're dealing with integers).
     - It iterates over the constraints:
       - If the constraint type `t` is 1, it updates `start` to the maximum of its current value and `v`.
       - If the constraint type `t` is 2, it updates `end` to the minimum of its current value and `v`.
       - If the constraint type `t` is 3, it adds `v` to the list `num`.
     - After processing all constraints, it counts how many numbers in the range `[start, end]` are in the list `num`.
     - It then calculates the total number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints by subtracting the count of numbers in `num` from the size of the range `[start, end]`.
     - If `start` is greater than `end`, it means there are no valid integers, so it returns 0.
     - Otherwise, it returns the calculated number of valid integers.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases using `func_1` and then processes each test case using `func_7`.
   - It stores the results in the list `ans` and prints each result after processing all test cases.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Handling Constraints:**
  - Type 1 constraints (`k >= x`) are handled by updating `start`.
  - Type 2 constraints (`k <= x`) are handled by updating `end`.
  - Type 3 constraints (`k != x`) are stored in the list `num`.

- **Range Calculation:**
  - The range of valid `k` values is `[start, end]`.
  - The function correctly calculates the number of integers in this range that are not in `num`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If `start > end`, it correctly returns 0, indicating no valid integers.
  - The function handles large ranges up to 1,000,000,000 as required.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
