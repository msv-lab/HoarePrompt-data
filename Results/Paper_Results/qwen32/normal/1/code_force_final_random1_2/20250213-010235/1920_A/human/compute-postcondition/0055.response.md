Let's analyze the loop to understand its behavior with the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

The loop iterates over each element in the list `num`. For each element `i` in `num`, it checks if `i` is less than `start` (20) or greater than `end` (50). If either condition is true, the loop skips to the next iteration using `continue`. If neither condition is true (meaning `i` is between 20 and 50 inclusive), it increments `count_num` by 1.

Given the list `num` as `[100, 200]`, let's see how the loop behaves:

1. First iteration (`i = 100`): Since `100` is greater than `50`, the condition `i < start or i > end` is true, so the loop continues to the next iteration without changing `count_num`.
2. Second iteration (`i = 200`): Since `200` is also greater than `50`, the condition `i < start or i > end` is true again, so the loop continues to the next iteration without changing `count_num`.

Since there are no more elements in the list `num` to iterate over, the loop terminates after these two iterations.

Thus, `count_num` remains 0 because none of the elements in `num` were within the range `[20, 50]`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **start is 20, end is 50, num is [100, 200], count_num is 0.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `start`, `end`, and `num` retain their initial values, and `count_num` remains 0 because none of the numbers in the list `num` fell within the specified range.
