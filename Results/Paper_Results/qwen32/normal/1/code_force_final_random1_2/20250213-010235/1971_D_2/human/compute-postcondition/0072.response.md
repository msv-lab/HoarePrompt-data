Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `i` is 2, `s` is the new input string with length greater than 1, `j` is 0, `count` is 2 if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, otherwise `count` remains 1, and `flag` is True if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False.**
