The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases, which was previously described as being between 1 and 500 inclusive.

Since the code only updates the value of `t` and does not affect the strings `s` associated with each test case, the condition about `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |`s`| ≤ 500.**
