The value of `count` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `i` is 2, `s` is the new input string with length greater than 1, `j` is 0, `count` is 2, and `flag` is False. Additionally, the character at index `j` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `j + 1`.**
