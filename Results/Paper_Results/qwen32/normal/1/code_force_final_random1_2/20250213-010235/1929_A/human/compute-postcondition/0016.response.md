Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `ntest` is greater than 0; `itest` equals `ntest`; no more test cases are processed; the loop has terminated.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `itest` will have reached the value of `ntest`, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The loop terminates as there are no more test cases to handle. The values of `t` remain unchanged throughout the process since they are not modified within the loop.
