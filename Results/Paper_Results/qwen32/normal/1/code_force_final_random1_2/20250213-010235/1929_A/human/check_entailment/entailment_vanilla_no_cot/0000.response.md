Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array to maximize this sum. The current implementation only calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum beauty.

To achieve the maximum beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order, and then the beauty can be calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        beauty = sum(a[i] - a[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

func()
```

This version sorts the array and computes the sum of differences between consecutive elements, which gives the correct maximum beauty.
