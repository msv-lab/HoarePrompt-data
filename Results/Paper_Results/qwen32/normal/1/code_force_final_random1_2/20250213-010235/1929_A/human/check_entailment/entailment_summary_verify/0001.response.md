### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly analyzes the problem and the provided solution. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to ensure everything aligns with the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Analysis:

The beauty of the array is defined as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

By simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]

This is because all intermediate terms cancel out, leaving only the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array.

#### Solution Analysis:

The provided code follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases (`ntest`).
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the length of the array (`n`).
   - It reads the array elements (`a`).
   - It sorts the array.
   - It calculates the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array.
   - It prints this difference as the result.

This approach ensures that the maximum possible beauty is calculated for each test case.

#### Function Summary Validation:

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the code:
- The function reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`.

Given that the function summary matches the code's behavior and the problem analysis confirms the logic, the original assessment is accurate.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly solves the problem as per the provided logic and constraints.

**Final:** **True**
