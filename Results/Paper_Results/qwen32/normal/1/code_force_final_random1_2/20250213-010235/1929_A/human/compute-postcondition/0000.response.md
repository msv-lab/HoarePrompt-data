Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `ntest` is an input integer; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The variable `ntest` is assigned the value of the input integer, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
