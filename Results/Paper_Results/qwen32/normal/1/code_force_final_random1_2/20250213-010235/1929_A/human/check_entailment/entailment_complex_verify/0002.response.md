### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the core logic needed to solve the problem. The beauty of the array is indeed simplified to \(a_n - a_1\) after observing that all intermediate terms cancel out. Sorting the array and then calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values is a valid strategy to achieve the maximum beauty.

Let's break down the annotated code to ensure it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`ntest`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`n`) and the array elements (`a`).

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order.

3. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - The beauty is calculated as the difference between the last element (`a[len(a) - 1]`) and the first element (`a[0]`) of the sorted array.
   - This difference represents \(a_n - a_1\) after sorting, which is the maximum possible beauty.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

Given these steps, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array for each test case. The annotations confirm that the program performs the necessary operations and reaches the correct result.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct as it accurately computes the maximum beauty of the array for each test case by sorting the array and finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
