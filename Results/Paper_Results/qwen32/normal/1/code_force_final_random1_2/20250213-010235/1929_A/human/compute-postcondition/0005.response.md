Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 (number of test cases).
- `ntest` must be greater than 0 (though `ntest` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 (number of integers in the list).
  - `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
```

### Analysis:
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- Since `a` is sorted, `a[0]` is the smallest element in the list, and `a[len(a) - 1]` is the largest element in the list.
- The expression `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`.

### Output Description:
The code prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a` (where `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers)**

To make it more precise, let's denote the smallest element as `min_a` and the largest element as `max_a`. Therefore, the output can be described as:

Output: **max_a - min_a (where max_a is the largest element and min_a is the smallest element in the sorted list `a`)**
