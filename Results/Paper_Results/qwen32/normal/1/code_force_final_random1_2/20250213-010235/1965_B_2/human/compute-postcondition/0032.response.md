Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 2 <= k < n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`, `ans` is a list containing `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2, 2 ** (lk + 1)]`, `i` is `lk + 1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` has been updated to include an additional element, which is `2` raised to the power of `i` (or `lk + 1`). All other variables remain unchanged.
