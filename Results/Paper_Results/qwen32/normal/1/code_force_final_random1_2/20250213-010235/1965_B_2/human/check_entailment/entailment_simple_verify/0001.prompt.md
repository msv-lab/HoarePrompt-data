You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
- This sequence must satisfy two conditions:
  1. There should be no subsequence of `a` whose sum equals `k`.
  2. For every integer `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`), there should be a subsequence of `a` whose sum equals `v`.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.

2. **Generating the Sequence:**
   - The function `func_14()` generates the sequence `a` based on the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It converts `n` and `k` to binary strings `b` and `bk`, respectively.
   - If `k` is 1:
     - If `n` is 2, it returns `[2]`.
     - Otherwise, it initializes `ans` with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - If `k` is not 1:
     - It initializes `ans` with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus one.
     - It appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
     - It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to cover additional sums.
     - It appends further powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The generated sequence `a` is supposed to meet the criteria mentioned in the problem statement.
   - The program ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by carefully selecting the elements.
   - It also ensures that every integer `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed as a sum of some subsequence of `a`.

### Verification:

- **Condition 1:** The program avoids including `k` directly in the sequence and carefully selects other numbers to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.
- **Condition 2:** By including powers of 2 and other calculated values, the program ensures that every possible sum from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate sequences that satisfy both conditions for each test case. Given the constraints and the logic used, the program seems to be correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
