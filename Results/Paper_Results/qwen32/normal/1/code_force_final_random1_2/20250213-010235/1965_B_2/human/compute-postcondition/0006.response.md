To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the behavior described in the problem statement. Specifically, the loop will execute `func_10()` times, and during each iteration, it writes the return value of `func_14()` (converted to a string) followed by a newline character to the standard output.

From the given information:
- After the first iteration, `func_14()`'s return value (as a string) followed by a newline is printed.
- After the second iteration, the same process repeats.
- After the third iteration, the same process repeats.

This pattern indicates that for each iteration, the same operation occurs. Therefore, after `func_10()` iterations, the output will consist of `func_10()` lines, each containing the return value of `func_14()` (as a string) followed by a newline.

Let's denote the return value of `func_14()` as `val`. Then, the output state after all iterations can be described as:

Output State: **`val\n` repeated `func_10()` times.**

In natural language, this means that the final output will be a sequence of lines, where each line contains the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()`, and the total number of such lines is equal to the value returned by `func_10()`.
