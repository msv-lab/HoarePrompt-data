The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 4, `2 ** i` evaluates to `2 ** 4`, which is `16`. Therefore, `16` is appended to the list `ans`.

The initial state specifies that `ans` is `[2, 3, 2, 8]`. After appending `16`, `ans` becomes `[2, 3, 2, 8, 16]`.

All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is 1, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b` and is greater than 2, `ans` is [2, 3, 2, 8, 16], `i` is 4**.
