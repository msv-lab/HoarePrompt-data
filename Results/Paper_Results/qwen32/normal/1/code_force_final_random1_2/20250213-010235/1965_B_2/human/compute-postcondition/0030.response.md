The given code snippet appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we can only express the new element appended to `ans` in terms of `2 ** i`.

Given that the initial state includes:
- `n` and `k` are integers with constraints 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 2 <= k < n,
- `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix,
- `l` is the length of the binary string `b`,
- `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix,
- `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`,
- `ans` is a list containing `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`,

After executing the line `ans.append(2 ** i)`, the list `ans` will now contain five elements, with the last element being `2 ** i`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 2 <= k < n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`, and `ans` is a list containing `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2 ** i]`.**
