### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and see if it meets the problem requirements.

#### Overview of the Program:
- The program reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
- It then constructs a sequence `a` that satisfies the following conditions:
  1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
  2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

#### Analysis of `func_14`:
- `func_14` is the core function responsible for generating the sequence `a` for each test case.
- The function handles two main cases:
  1. When `k == 1`:
     - If `n == 2`, it returns the sequence `[2]`.
     - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 until the length of the binary representation of `n`.
  2. When `k > 1`:
     - It constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
     - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence.
     - Finally, it appends additional powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

#### Verification of Conditions:
- **Condition 1**: There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
  - When `k == 1`, the sequence does not include `1` and avoids sums that would result in `1`.
  - When `k > 1`, the specific construction ensures that no combination of the elements in the sequence sums to `k`.
- **Condition 2**: For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.
  - The inclusion of powers of 2 allows for the formation of many sums.
  - Additional elements like `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` help fill in gaps to ensure all sums from `1` to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.

#### Conclusion:
The function `func_14` appears to correctly generate sequences that satisfy both conditions for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
