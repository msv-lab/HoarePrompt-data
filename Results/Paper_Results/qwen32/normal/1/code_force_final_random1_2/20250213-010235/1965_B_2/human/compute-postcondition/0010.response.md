The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `l`, and implicitly `range(2, l)`. Since `l` is determined by the length of the binary string `b` and does not change within the loop, we only need to adjust `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2 (as per the loop starting point), and since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is 1, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b` and is greater than 2, `ans` is [2, 3, 2], `i` is 3**
