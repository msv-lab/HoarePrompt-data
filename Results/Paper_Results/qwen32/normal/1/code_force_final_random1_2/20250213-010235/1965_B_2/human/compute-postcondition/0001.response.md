The code snippet writes the string representation of the return value of `func_14()` followed by a newline character to the standard output. Since there are no variables being explicitly modified in the given code, only the side effect of writing to the standard output occurs.

Given that `func_10()` must return a value greater than or equal to 1, this precondition does not affect the current code snippet because `func_14()` is called instead of `func_10()`. Therefore, the precondition about `func_10()` remains unchanged.

Output State: **The return value of `func_14()` (converted to a string) followed by a newline character is written to the standard output. `func_10()` must return a value greater than or equal to 1.**
