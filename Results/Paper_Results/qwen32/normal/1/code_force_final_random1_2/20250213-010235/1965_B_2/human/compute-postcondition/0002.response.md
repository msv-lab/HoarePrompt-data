In this task, the loop head contains the underscore `_` and the result of `func_10()`. Since the underscore `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a certain number of times, it does not need to be adjusted. The only variable that needs adjustment is the return value of `func_10()`.

Given that `func_10()` must return a value greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute, and considering that we are at the start of the next iteration, `func_10()` should still return a value that allows the loop to continue executing. This means that after the previous iteration, `func_10()` must have returned a value greater than 1, because if it returned 1, the loop would have ended after that iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 1 again.

State: **The return value of `func_14()` (converted to a string) followed by a newline character is written to the standard output. `func_10()` must return a value greater than 1.**
