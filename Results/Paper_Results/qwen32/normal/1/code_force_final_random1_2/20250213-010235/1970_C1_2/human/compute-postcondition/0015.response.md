Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the starting node for each round, `x` is an integer read from the input, `y` is an integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `lst[a]` now includes all `b` values corresponding to the edges read during the loop, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `rev[b]` now includes all `a` values corresponding to the edges read during the loop, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the state will be that `lst` will contain all the children nodes for each parent node based on the edges provided, and `rev` will contain all the parent nodes for each child node based on the edges provided. All other variables like `n`, `t`, the tree structure, and the starting nodes will remain unchanged.
