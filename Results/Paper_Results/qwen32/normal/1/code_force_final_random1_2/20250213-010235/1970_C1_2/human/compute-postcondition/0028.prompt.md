Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the starting node for each round, `x` is an integer read from the input, `y` is an integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `lst[a]` now includes all `b` values corresponding to the edges read during the loop, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `rev[b]` now includes all `a` values corresponding to the edges read during the loop, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `z` is an integer read from the input, `tmp` is an integer equal to `z`, `one` is True.
Code of the loop:
while lst[tmp] != []:
    one = not one
    tmp = lst[tmp].pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tmp` is the value of the last element that was in `lst[z]`; `lst[z]` has one less element than it did before the operation.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `tmp` is the value of the last element that was in `lst[tmp]` before the pop operation, `lst[tmp]` has one less element than it did before the operation, `lst[z]` has one less element than it did before the operation, `lst[tmp]` is not an empty list (unless it had only one element and is now empty), and `one` is the opposite of its previous boolean value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `tmp` is the value of the last element that was in `lst[tmp]` before the pop operation; `lst[tmp]` has one less element than it did before the operation and is not empty; `lst[z]` has one less element than it did before the operation; `one` is the opposite of its previous boolean value.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
