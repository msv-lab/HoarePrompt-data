Output State: **`queue` has one less element, `current` holds a node from the `tree` that has neighbors, `dist` holds the second element of the removed tuple, `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree including `neighbor`, and `neighbor` is now in the `visited` set.**

Explanation: The `visited` set now includes the `neighbor` node, which was not previously in the set. All other conditions remain unchanged.
