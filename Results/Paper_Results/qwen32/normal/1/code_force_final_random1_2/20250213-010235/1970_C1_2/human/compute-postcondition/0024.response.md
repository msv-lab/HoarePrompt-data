The code `tmp = lst[tmp].pop()` modifies the list at index `tmp` by removing and returning its last element, which is then reassigned to `tmp`. 

- Since `lst[tmp]` is not an empty list, it means there was at least one element in `lst[tmp]` before the `pop()` operation.
- After the `pop()`, `lst[tmp]` will have one less element than it did before.
- `tmp` is updated to hold the value of the last element that was in `lst[tmp]`.

Given these points, the updated state is:

Output State: **`tmp` is the value of the last element that was in `lst[tmp]` before the pop operation, `lst[tmp]` has one less element than it did before the operation, `lst[z]` has one less element than it did before the operation, `lst[tmp]` is not an empty list (unless it had only one element and is now empty), and `one` is the opposite of its previous boolean value.**
