Postcondition: **`queue` has one less element initially, `current` holds a node from the `tree` that has neighbors, `dist` holds the second element of the removed tuple, and `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` gains one more element, which is a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, and `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set. If `neighbor` is already in `visited`, no changes occur to `queue` or `visited`.**
