The given code snippet initializes a new `defaultdict` named `rev` with `list` as its default factory. This operation does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`n`, `t`, the tree structure, `x`, `y`, `lst`). The only change is the introduction of the new `rev` dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the starting node for each round. `x` and `y` are integers read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory. `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**
