The only variable in the loop head is `neighbor`, so we can only adjust that one. The loop iterates over each `neighbor` in `tree[current]`. To execute one more iteration, there must be another `neighbor` in `tree[current]` that hasn't been processed yet.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `queue` has one less element initially.
- `current` holds a node from the `tree` that has neighbors.
- `dist` holds the second element of the removed tuple.
- `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree.
- If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` gains one more element, which is a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, and `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set.
- If `neighbor` is already in `visited`, no changes occur to `queue` or `visited`.

Since the loop processes each `neighbor` in `tree[current]`, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more `neighbor` in `tree[current]` that has not yet been visited.

State: **`queue` has one less element initially, `current` holds a node from the `tree` that has neighbors, `dist` holds the second element of the removed tuple, `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree except for at least one `neighbor` of `current`, `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor of `current` in `tree[current]`**
