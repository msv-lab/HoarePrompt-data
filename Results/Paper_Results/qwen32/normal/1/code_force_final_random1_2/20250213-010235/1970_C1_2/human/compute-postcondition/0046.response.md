Output State: **`queue` has one more element, which is a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `current` holds a node from the `tree` that has neighbors, `dist` holds the second element of the removed tuple, `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree including `neighbor`, and `neighbor` is now in the `visited` set.**

Explanation: The `queue` gains an additional element, specifically the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. All other variables retain their original states as described in the initial conditions.
