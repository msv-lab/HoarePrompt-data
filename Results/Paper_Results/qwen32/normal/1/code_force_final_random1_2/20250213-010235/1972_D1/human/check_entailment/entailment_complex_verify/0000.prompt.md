You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The core function `func_15` is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` satisfying the conditions `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the implementation in `func_15` does not accurately reflect this logic.

Let's break down the issue:

1. **Logic Mismatch**: The function `func_15` calculates something related to divisors and sums but does not directly address the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop `while i * i <= n + i:` and the calculation inside the loop do not align with the problem's requirement. Specifically, the expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` does not correctly check for the condition involving `gcd`.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple test case:
- Input: `n = 2`, `m = 3`
- Expected Output: `3` (pairs are `(1,1)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,2)`)

However, the function `func_15` will not produce the correct result for this input because it does not properly iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Here is a corrected version of the function that would satisfy the problem description:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        m = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the required condition, ensuring correctness for all inputs within the constraints. Since the original program does not do this, it is incorrect.
