Functionality: **The function calculates and returns a specific sum derived from two positive integers `n` and `m`, which are obtained from another function `func_7()`. The returned value is the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for `j` from 1 up to, but not including, the smallest integer `i` such that `i * i` is greater than `n + i`, minus one.**
