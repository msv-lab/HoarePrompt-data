Postcondition: **`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `da` is an integer key present in the dictionary `d` such that `d[da]` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `processing` is a list of integers, and `rank` is a list of integers. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, `tmp` is the minimum of its current value and the value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. `di` is `di_next`, the next element in `d[da]` after the current `di`.**
