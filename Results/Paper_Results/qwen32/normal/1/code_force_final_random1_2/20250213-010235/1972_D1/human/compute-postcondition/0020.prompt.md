Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers representing a processing state (0 or 1), `da` is an integer key present in the dictionary `d`, `rank` is a list of integers, `tmp` is 1000000000. The length of the list `d[da]` is greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
for di in d[da]:
    if processing[di - 1] == 0:
        processing[di - 1] = 1
        tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
        processing[di - 1] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `da` is an integer key present in the dictionary `d` such that `d[da]` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `processing` is a list of integers representing a processing state (0 or 1) with `processing[di - 1]` now equal to 0 if the initial value was 0, `rank` is a list of integers, and `tmp` is the minimum of 1000000000 and the value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` if `processing[di - 1]` was 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `da` is an integer key present in the dictionary `d` such that `d[da]` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `processing` is a list of integers where `processing[di - 1]` is now 0, `rank` is a list of integers, and `tmp` is the minimum of its current value and the value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` if `processing[di - 1]` was 0. `di` is the next element in `d[da]` after the current `di`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `da` is an integer key present in the dictionary `d` such that `d[da]` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `processing` is a list of integers, and `rank` is a list of integers. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, `tmp` is the minimum of its current value and the value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. `di` is `di_next`, the next element in `d[da]` after the current `di`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
