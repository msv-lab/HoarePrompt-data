In this case, the loop head contains the underscore `_` and the function call `func_10()`. The underscore `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use, so we don't need to adjust its state. The key here is to ensure that `func_10()` returns a value that allows the loop to execute.

Since the loop will execute `func_10()` times, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer. Given the information provided, there are no constraints directly on `func_10()`, so we must assume that `func_10()` could return any value. To guarantee that the loop executes at least once, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer. However, since we cannot directly control the return value of `func_10()` within the given constraints, we can only state that it must return a positive integer for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` must return a positive integer**
