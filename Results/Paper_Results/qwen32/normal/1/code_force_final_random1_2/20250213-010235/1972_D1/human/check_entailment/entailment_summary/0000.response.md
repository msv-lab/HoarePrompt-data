### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and analyze whether the provided functions collectively solve it.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
  - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Functions Analysis:
1. **Input Reading Functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_7`, `func_8`)**:
   - These functions handle reading input from standard input, which includes the number of test cases and the pairs of integers \(n\) and \(m\).
   
2. **Main Function (`func_16`)**:
   - This function orchestrates the process by reading the number of test cases using `func_10` and then calling `func_15` for each test case, printing the result.

3. **Core Calculation Function (`func_15`)**:
   - This function is supposed to compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).

#### Key Points to Check:
- **Correctness of `func_15`**:
  - The core logic lies in `func_15`. However, the implementation of `func_15` does not seem to directly address the problem statement. Specifically, `func_15` calculates a sum involving `(n + j) // (j * j)` which does not inherently relate to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

- **Condition Verification**:
  - The problem requires checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This involves iterating through possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and verifying the condition, which is not evident in the provided code.

#### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided functions do not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Specifically, `func_15` does not contain the necessary logic to check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correctness: **False**
