### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the logic required by the problem statement. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
     - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Utility Functions (func_1 to func_11)**: These functions are for input/output operations and are not relevant to the core logic.
   - **Irrelevant Functions (func_12 to func_14)**: These functions appear to be solving a different problem and are not related to the current problem.
   - **Main Logic (func_15 and func_16)**:
     - **func_15**: This function attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs but uses a loop involving the square root of \(n + i\), which does not align with the problem's requirements.
     - **func_16**: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_15` for each test case.

3. **Logic in `func_15`**:
   ```python
   def func_15():
       (n, m) = func_7()
       i = 1
       ans = 0
       while i * i <= n + i:
           ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
           i += 1
       return ans - 1
   ```
   - The loop condition `while i * i <= n + i` and the calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)` do not correspond to checking whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The function does not compute the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) at any point, which is a crucial part of the problem.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in `func_15` does not correctly implement the required conditions for the problem.
   - Therefore, the program as a whole is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
