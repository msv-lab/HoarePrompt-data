In this task, the loop head contains the variable `_` and the function call `func_10()`. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. Therefore, its value does not need to be adjusted. The loop will continue to execute as long as the return value of `func_10()` is greater than 0.

Given that we are at the start of the next iteration, the return value of `func_10()` from the previous iteration must have been greater than 0, allowing the loop to proceed. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0 again during this iteration.

The values of `n` and `m` are mentioned in the state but are not part of the loop head, so they should remain unchanged. The fact that a positive integer from `func_15()` has been returned and printed is also not relevant to the loop's continuation condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same except for the implicit requirement that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and a positive integer from `func_15()` has been returned and printed.**
