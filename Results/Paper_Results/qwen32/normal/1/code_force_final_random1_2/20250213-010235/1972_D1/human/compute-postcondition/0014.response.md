Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for `j` from 1 to `i - 1`, and `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of `n + 1`. Here, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.**
