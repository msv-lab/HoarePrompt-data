Let's analyze the provided code and the problem statement to determine if the code correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Code Analysis:
The provided code includes several functions, but only one function (`func_15`) seems relevant to solving the problem. Let's examine `func_15`:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

#### Explanation of `func_15`:
1. It reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
2. It initializes `ans` to 0 and `i` to 1.
3. It iterates while \(i \cdot i \leq n + i\).
4. In each iteration, it adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i \cdot i} \right\rfloor\) to `ans`.
5. It increments `i` by 1.
6. Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

#### Correctness Check:
The logic in `func_15` does not match the problem requirements. The problem requires checking pairs (a, b) to see if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, `func_15` does not perform any checks involving pairs or gcd calculations. Instead, it performs a loop that involves division and addition operations unrelated to the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_15` does not implement the required logic to count the valid pairs (a, b) as per the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
