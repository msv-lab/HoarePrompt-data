### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program and its annotations to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code includes several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_11`) for reading input and output. Functions `func_12` to `func_14` seem unrelated to the problem. The main logic appears to be in `func_15`.

#### Detailed Analysis of `func_15`:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

This function calculates a sum based on the loop condition \(i * i \leq n + i\). The expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) is summed up, and the final result is `ans - 1`.

However, this logic does not align with the problem requirements. The problem requires checking whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each pair \((a, b)\). The provided function does not perform any gcd calculations or checks for the multiple condition.

#### Annotations Review:
The annotations describe the behavior of each function, but they do not provide any insight into how `func_15` is supposed to solve the problem. The annotations confirm that `func_15` is indeed the main function being called for each test case, but they do not justify why the current implementation is correct.

#### Verification Against Example Test Cases:
Let's verify the provided function against the example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Actual Output: `func_15(1, 1)` would compute:
     ```python
     i = 1
     ans = 0
     while 1 * 1 <= 1 + 1:
         ans += (1 + 1) // (1 * 1)  # ans = 2
         i += 1
     return 2 - 1  # Output: 1
     ```
   - This matches the expected output, but we need to check more cases.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `2 3`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Actual Output: `func_15(2, 3)` would compute:
     ```python
     i = 1
     ans = 0
     while 1 * 1 <= 2 + 1:
         ans += (2 + 1) // (1 * 1)  # ans = 3
         i += 1
     while 2 * 2 <= 2 + 2:
         ans += (2 + 2) // (2 * 2)  # ans = 4
         i += 1
     return 4 - 1  # Output: 3
     ```
   - This matches the expected output, but again, we need to check more cases.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Actual Output: `func_15(3, 5)` would compute:
     ```python
     i = 1
     ans = 0
     while 1 * 1 <= 3 + 1:
         ans += (3 + 1) // (1 * 1)  # ans = 4
         i += 1
     while 2 * 2 <= 3 + 2:
         ans += (3 + 2) // (2 * 2)  # ans = 5
         i += 1
     return 5 - 1  # Output: 4
     ```
   - This matches the expected output.

However, these test cases alone do not prove the correctness of the function. We need to ensure that the function correctly handles all possible inputs according to the problem statement.

#### Correct Implementation:
A correct implementation would involve iterating over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a sketch of a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation correctly checks each pair \((a, b)\) and counts those that satisfy the given condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. While it happens to produce the correct output for the given example test cases, it does not generalize to all possible inputs.

**Final: False**
