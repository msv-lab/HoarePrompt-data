Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The function `func_15()` and `func_16()` seem to be related to counting some pairs, but they do not implement the logic required to solve the specific problem of counting pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Here's a brief analysis of why the program is incorrect:

- The problem requires checking pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m` and verifying if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- The function `func_15()` calculates something related to divisors and sums, but it does not check the condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd).
- The function `func_16()` iterates through the test cases and calls `func_15()`, which does not provide the correct output for the problem.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given constraints and check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds true. This can be done efficiently using properties of gcd and possibly memoization or other optimizations due to the large constraints.
