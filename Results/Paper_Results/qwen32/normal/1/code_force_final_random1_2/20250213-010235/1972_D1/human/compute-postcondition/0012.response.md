To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the condition under which the loop terminates. The loop continues as long as `i * i <= n + i`. Once `i * i` exceeds `n + i`, the loop stops.

From the given information, we know the following:
- After the first iteration, `i` becomes 2.
- After the second iteration, `i` becomes 3.
- After the third iteration, `i` becomes 4.

This pattern suggests that `i` increments by 1 with each iteration. Therefore, the loop will terminate when `i * i > n + i`.

Let's denote the final value of `i` as `k`, such that `k * k > n + k` and `(k-1) * (k-1) <= n + (k-1)`.

The value of `ans` after all iterations is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to `k-1`.

Given the pattern observed in the first three iterations:
- After the first iteration, `ans = (n + 1) // 1`
- After the second iteration, `ans = (n + 1) // 1 + (n + 2) // 4`
- After the third iteration, `ans = (n + 1) // 1 + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`

We can generalize this to:
\[ \text{ans} = \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \left( \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right) \]

The loop terminates when `i * i > n + i`, so `k` is the smallest integer such that `k^2 > n + k`. This means `k = \lceil \sqrt{n + 1} \rceil`.

Therefore, the final value of `ans` is the sum of the terms from `i = 1` to `i = \lceil \sqrt{n + 1} \rceil - 1`.

The final state of the variables will be:
- `i` will be `\lceil \sqrt{n + 1} \rceil`
- `ans` will be the computed sum as described above
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they were initially set by `func_7()`

Thus, the output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, which are positive integers; `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of `n + 1`; `ans` is the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for `j` from 1 to `i - 1`.**
