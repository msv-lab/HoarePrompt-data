### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
     - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
     - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program consists of several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_11`) for reading input.
   - The main logic is contained in `func_15` and `func_16`.
   - `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case.
   - `func_15` reads the values of `n` and `m` and calculates a sum using the formula `(n + i) // (i * i)` for `i` up to the square root of `n + i`.

3. **Logic Mismatch**:
   - The logic in `func_15` does not match the problem requirements. It calculates a sum based on divisors but does not check the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The loop condition `while i * i <= n + i:` and the calculation inside the loop do not align with the problem's requirement.

4. **Verification Using Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm that `func_15` calculates a specific sum without checking the required condition for the pairs `(a, b)`.
   - There is no iteration over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and no check for the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - A correct implementation would involve iterating over all pairs `(a, b)` and checking the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The corrected version provided in the original assessment correctly implements this logic.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
