To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head: `i`, `n`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
- `n` is defined as `len(arr) - 1` and must be greater than 1.

Let's analyze the state:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` remains unchanged throughout the iterations; it is determined by the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - Since `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `n` must be at least 2.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- If `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it would be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
- `n` remains the same, which is `len(arr) - 1` and must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is at least 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end, and `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`, `n` is len(arr) - 1 and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2**
