Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tc` is at least 1; For each test case, `n` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer read from the input, while the other variables (`t`, `tc`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) remain unchanged.
