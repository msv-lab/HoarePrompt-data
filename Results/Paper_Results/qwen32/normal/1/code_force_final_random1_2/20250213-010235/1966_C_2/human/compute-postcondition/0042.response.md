Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is at least 0, `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end and must have at least 3 elements, `dp` is `True` if no consecutive elements in `arr` (from index 1 to `n-1`) have a difference of 1 or less; otherwise, `dp` is `False`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1 (at least 2), `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The value of `tc` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
