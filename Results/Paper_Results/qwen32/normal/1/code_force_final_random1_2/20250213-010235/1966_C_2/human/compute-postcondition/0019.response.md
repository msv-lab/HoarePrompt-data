The code snippet assigns the length of the list `arr` minus one to the variable `n`. Given that `arr` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end, the length of `arr` is at least 2 (because `tc` must be at least 2, implying there are at least two elements including the appended `0`). Therefore, `n` will be at least 1.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` must be at least 2, `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end, `dp` is `True`, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `i` is `n-1` (based on the old value of `n`).**
