In this case, the for loop's execution depends on the return value of the function `func_10()`. The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1). The underscore `_` indicates that the loop variable is not used within the loop body.

Since there are no specific variables mentioned in the state before the loop starts, we need to focus on ensuring that `func_10()` returns a value that allows the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `func_10()` returns a value greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than or equal to 1**
