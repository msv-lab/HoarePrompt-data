To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the logic and ensure it meets the problem requirements.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Problem Recap:
We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers such that:
1. No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
2. For every integer `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`), there exists a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

#### Program Breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_10()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.

2. **Generating the Sequence (`func_14`):**
   - **Case 1: `k == 1`**
     - If `n == 2`, the sequence is `[2]`. This works because the only possible sum is `2`, which is not `1`.
     - Otherwise, the sequence starts with `[2, 3]` and includes powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`. This ensures that all sums from `1` to `n` (excluding `1`) can be formed.
   - **Case 2: `k != 1`**
     - The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus one.
     - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to avoid any subsequence summing to `k`.
     - It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to cover additional sums.
     - Finally, it appends further powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

3. **Output:**
   - The sequence is printed for each test case.

#### Verification:

- **Condition 1: No Subsequence Sums to `k`**
  - For `k == 1`, the sequence avoids `1` directly.
  - For `k != 1`, the term `k - 1 - sum(ans)` is specifically chosen to prevent any subsequence from summing to `k`.

- **Condition 2: All Sums from `1` to `n` (Excluding `k`) Can Be Formed**
  - The inclusion of powers of 2 allows for forming many sums.
  - Additional terms like `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` help cover gaps and ensure all required sums can be formed.

### Challenges and Edge Cases:

1. **Edge Case: `k == 1`**
   - When `k == 1`, the sequence `[2]` works for `n == 2` because no subsequence can sum to `1`.
   - For larger `n`, the sequence `[2, 3]` along with powers of 2 ensures all sums from `2` to `n` can be formed.

2. **Edge Case: `k > 1`**
   - The inclusion of `k - 1 - sum(ans)` ensures no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - The additional terms `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` help cover sums around `k`.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the logic and verifying against the problem requirements, the program appears to correctly generate sequences that satisfy both conditions for each test case. The handling of edge cases and the construction of the sequence seem robust.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
