Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
- This sequence must satisfy two conditions:
  1. There should be no subsequence of `a` whose sum equals `k`.
  2. For every integer `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`), there should be a subsequence of `a` whose sum equals `v`.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.

2. **Generating the Sequence:**
   - The function `func_14()` generates the sequence `a` based on the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It converts `n` and `k` to binary strings `b` and `bk`, respectively.
   - If `k` is 1:
     - If `n` is 2, it returns `[2]`.
     - Otherwise, it initializes `ans` with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - If `k` is not 1:
     - It initializes `ans` with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus one.
     - It appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
     - It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to cover additional sums.
     - It appends further powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The generated sequence `a` is supposed to meet the criteria mentioned in the problem statement.
   - The program ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by carefully selecting the elements.
   - It also ensures that every integer `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed as a sum of some subsequence of `a`.

### Verification:

- **Condition 1:** The program avoids including `k` directly in the sequence and carefully selects other numbers to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.
- **Condition 2:** By including powers of 2 and other calculated values, the program ensures that every possible sum from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate sequences that satisfy both conditions for each test case. Given the constraints and the logic used, the program seems to be correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
