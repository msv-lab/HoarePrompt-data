The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Since the initial state does not specify a value for `i`, we cannot determine the exact value being appended. However, we know that `ans` initially contains `[2, 3]`, and after the operation, it will contain `[2, 3, 2 ** i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is 1, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b` and is greater than 2, `ans` is [2, 3, 2 ** i]**.
