The code appends `k + 1` to the list `ans`. Therefore, the list `ans` which was initially `[2, k - 3]` will now be `[2, k - 3, k + 1]`.

Other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 2 <= k <= n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`, and `ans` is a list containing `[2, k - 3, k + 1]`.**
