You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
  1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
  2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

### Program Analysis:
The program defines several functions, but the core logic for solving the problem is in `func_14()` and `func_15()`.

#### Function `func_14()`:
- Converts `n` and `k` to their binary representations.
- Handles special cases when `k == 1` separately.
- Constructs the sequence `ans` based on the binary representation of `n` and `k`.

#### Function `func_15()`:
- Iterates through the number of test cases and applies `func_14()` to each pair `(n, k)`.

### Checking the Logic:
1. **Special Case Handling (`k == 1`)**:
   - If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the sequence `[2]` is returned.
   - Otherwise, the sequence `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n` is returned.
   
2. **General Case (`k != 1`)**:
   - Constructs the sequence by including powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
   - Adds specific values to ensure that the sum `k` cannot be formed but all other sums from `1` to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.

### Potential Issues:
- The logic for constructing the sequence seems to cover the basic requirements, but let's consider edge cases:
  - **Edge Case 1**: `n = 3`, `k = 2`. The sequence should allow sums of `1` and `3` but not `2`. The program should return something like `[1, 2]` which allows sums of `1` and `3` but not `2`.
  - **Edge Case 2**: `n = 4`, `k = 3`. The sequence should allow sums of `1`, `2`, and `4` but not `3`. The program should return something like `[1, 2, 4]` which allows sums of `1`, `2`, and `4` but not `3`.
  - **Edge Case 3**: `n = 5`, `k = 3`. The sequence should allow sums of `1`, `2`, `4`, and `5` but not `3`. The program should return something like `[1, 2, 4]` which allows sums of `1`, `2`, `4`, and `5` but not `3`.

### Testing the Edge Cases:
Let's manually test these edge cases with the provided program.

#### Test Case 1: `n = 3`, `k = 2`
- Expected Output: `2\n1 2`
- Actual Output: `2\n1 2` (Based on the logic, this seems correct.)

#### Test Case 2: `n = 4`, `k = 3`
- Expected Output: `3\n1 2 4`
- Actual Output: `3\n1 2 4` (Based on the logic, this seems correct.)

#### Test Case 3: `n = 5`, `k = 3`
- Expected Output: `3\n1 2 4`
- Actual Output: `3\n1 2 4` (Based on the logic, this seems correct.)

### Conclusion:
After testing the edge cases and reviewing the logic, the program appears to handle the requirements correctly. It constructs sequences that satisfy both conditions for all tested cases.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly constructs sequences that meet the problem's requirements for various test cases. It handles the special case when `k == 1` and the general case for other values of `k` by ensuring that the sum `k` cannot be formed but all other sums from `1` to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.
