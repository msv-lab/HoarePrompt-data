The given code snippet appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, which means its value is unknown. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value being appended to `ans`.

Given the lack of a specific value for `i`, we can only describe the state in terms of the operation performed.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 2 <= k <= n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk` and must be at least 2, and `ans` is a list containing one element, `2 ** i`.**
