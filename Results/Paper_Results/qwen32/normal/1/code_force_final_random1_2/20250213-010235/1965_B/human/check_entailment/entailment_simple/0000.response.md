### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

#### Key Points of the Problem:
1. We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
2. There should be no subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `k`.
3. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `v`.

#### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Input Reading**: The code reads the number of test cases (`t`) using `func_10()`, which calls `input()` and converts it to an integer.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, `func_14()` is called. This function reads two integers `n` and `k` using `func_7()`, which splits the input line and converts each part to an integer.
3. **Binary Representation**: The binary representations of `n` and `k` are calculated using `bin(n)[2:]` and `bin(k)[2:]`, respectively.
4. **Generating the Sequence**:
   - If `k == 1`:
     - If `n == 2`, the sequence is `[2]`.
     - Otherwise, the sequence starts with `[2, 3]` and then includes powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - If `k > 1`:
     - The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
     - Then, it includes `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`.
     - Finally, it includes additional powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

#### Verification:
- **Subsequences Summing to `k`**: The code ensures that `k` is not achievable by including `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` in the sequence, which effectively avoids creating a subsequence that sums to `k`.
- **Subsequences Summing to Other Values**: The inclusion of powers of 2 allows for the creation of subsequences that sum to any value from 1 to `n` except `k`. This is because any number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (binary representation).

#### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to correctly generate sequences that meet the problem's requirements. It handles both cases (`k == 1` and `k > 1`) appropriately and ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from 1 to `n`.
