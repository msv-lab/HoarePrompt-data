Postcondition: **`tt` is greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input, with `y` potentially adjusted; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `ans` is updated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`; `tmp` contains all the half-differences that met the even difference and `y` condition; `ii` is incremented by 1; the sum of the first element of `a` plus `n` minus the last element of `a` equals 2.**
