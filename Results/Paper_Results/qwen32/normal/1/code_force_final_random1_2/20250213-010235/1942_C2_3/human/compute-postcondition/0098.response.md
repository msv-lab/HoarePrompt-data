Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2, the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, `y` is `y - (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 + 1`, `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `ans` is increased by `tmp`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is updated by subtracting `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged.
