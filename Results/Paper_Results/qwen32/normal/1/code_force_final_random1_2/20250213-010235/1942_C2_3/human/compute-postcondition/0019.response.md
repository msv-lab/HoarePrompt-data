The given code appends a calculated value to the list `tmp`. The value being appended is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Given that `i` is 3, the value being appended is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.

Since the initial state specifies that `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, we can infer that `a[3]` and `a[2]` exist and are integers. However, without specific values for `a[3]` and `a[2]`, we can only express the new element of `tmp` in terms of these variables.

The other variables (`tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`tt` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input with at least 2 elements; `i` is 3; `tmp` contains an additional element which is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.**
