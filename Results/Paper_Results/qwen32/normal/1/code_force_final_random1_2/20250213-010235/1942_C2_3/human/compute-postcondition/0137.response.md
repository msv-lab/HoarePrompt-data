Postcondition: **`val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order. If `y` is less than `c`, `sx` is the original count of `1`s in `val` plus `y * 2`. If `y` is not less than `c`, `sx` remains the original count of `1`s in `val`. `c` is `i // 2`.**
