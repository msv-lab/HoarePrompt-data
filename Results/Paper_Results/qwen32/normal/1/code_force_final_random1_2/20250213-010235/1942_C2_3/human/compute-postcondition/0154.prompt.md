Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `val` is sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order; `sx` is the count of `1`s in `val`; `i` is `x`.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order. If `y` is less than `c`, `sx` is the original count of `1`s in `val` plus `y * 2` plus `i`. If `y` is not less than `c`, `sx` is the original count of `1`s in `val` plus `i`. `c` is `i // 2`. `y` is decreased by `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order; `i` is `i_next`; `y` is decreased by `c` (where `c` was `i_current // 2`); `c` is `i_next // 2`; `sx` is increased by `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order; `i` is `i_new`; `c` is `i_new // 2`; `sx` is `sx + i_new`; `y` is reduced by `i_new // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
