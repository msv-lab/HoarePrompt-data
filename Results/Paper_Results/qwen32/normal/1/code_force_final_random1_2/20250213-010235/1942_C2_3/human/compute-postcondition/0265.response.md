Output State: **`odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, containing at least one element; `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even; `gap` is the next element in the list `odd`; `ans` is 0; `y` is 0; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `odd`, `even`, `gap`, `ans`, and `y` remain unchanged. We exit the most internal loop or if statement without modifying any of these variables.
