Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `val` is [], `sx` is 0, `y` is decremented by the sum of `c` for each element processed, `i` is the last element processed, `cons` is `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`, `t` is truthy and decreased by 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are now the values returned by `R()` and are sorted in ascending order within `l`, `l` now includes an additional element which is `n + l[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
    if c == 1:
        sx += 1
    val.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` must be at least 1; `c` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`; `val` has `c` appended to it. If `c` was 1, `sx` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` must be at least 1; `i` is incremented by 1; `c` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`; If `c` equals 1, `sx` is incremented by 1; `val` now contains `c` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` must be at least 1, `i` is 4, `c` is `l[4] - l[3] - 1`, `val` includes `c` appended to its previous contents. If `c` equals 1, `sx` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
