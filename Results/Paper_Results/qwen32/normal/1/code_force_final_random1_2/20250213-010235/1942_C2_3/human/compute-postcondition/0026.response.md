The code appends the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given that `i` is 4, the value being appended is `(a[4] - a[3]) // 2`.

Output State: **`tt` is greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input with at least 2 elements; `i` is 4; `tmp` contains the additional element `(a[4] - a[3]) // 2`.**
