The code snippet provided increments the variable `ans` by `2 * y`. The value of `y` is not specified, so we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `ans`. However, we can express the new value of `ans` in terms of its previous value and `y`.

Output State: **`gap` is the next element in the list `odd`; `ans` is increased by `2 * y`.**
