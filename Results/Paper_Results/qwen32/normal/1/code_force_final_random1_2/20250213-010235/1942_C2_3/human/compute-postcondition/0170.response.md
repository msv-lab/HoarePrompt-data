The code snippet `ans += 2 * y` modifies the variable `ans` by adding `2 * y` to its current value. Given that `y` is `-gap // 2`, the value being added to `ans` is `-2 * (gap // 2)`, which simplifies to `-gap`.

Therefore, the value of `ans` is decreased by `gap`. The other variables (`odd`, `even`, `gap`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`odd` is a sorted list of all odd gaps greater than 1 and must contain at least two elements, `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0, `gap` is the next element in `odd` after `gap_current`, `y` is `-gap // 2`, `ans` is decreased by `gap`.**
