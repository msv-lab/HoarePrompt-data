The code snippet `ans += 2 * y` updates the value of `ans` by adding `2 * y` to its current value. Given that `y` is less than `gap // 2`, the exact new value of `ans` depends on its initial value and the value of `y`. However, the conditions on `odd`, `even`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, containing at least one element; `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even; the current value of `y` is less than `gap // 2`; `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `2 * y`.**
