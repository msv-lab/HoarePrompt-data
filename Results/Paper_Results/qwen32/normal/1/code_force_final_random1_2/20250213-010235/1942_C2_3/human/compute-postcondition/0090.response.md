The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `tmp`. None of the other variables (`tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `ans`) are affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`tt` is greater than or equal to 1; `ii` is incremented by 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is `x + y - 2`; `tmp` is an empty list.**
