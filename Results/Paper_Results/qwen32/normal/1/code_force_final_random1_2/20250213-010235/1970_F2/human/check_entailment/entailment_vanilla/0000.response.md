Let's analyze the provided Python code against the problem statement step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Initialization and Input Parsing
1. **Reading Dimensions**: The dimensions `N` and `M` of the field are read correctly.
2. **Field Parsing**:
   - The field is parsed line by line.
   - Players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger are identified and stored appropriately.
   - Players are stored in a dictionary `players` with their positions.
   - Goals are stored in a dictionary `goals` with lists of positions for each team.
   - The initial position of the Quaffle is stored in `quidditch`.
   - The middle position of the field is calculated and stored in `middle`.

#### Movement Handling
3. **Movement Dictionary**: A dictionary `mouvements` is used to map movement commands ('L', 'R', 'U', 'D') to coordinate changes.
4. **Processing Moves**:
   - For each move, the entity performing the action and the action itself are read.
   - **Quaffle Movement**: If the Quaffle is moved, its position is updated using the `func_1` function.
   - **Player Movement**: If a player moves, their position is updated.
     - After moving, if the player is on the same cell as the Bludger, the player is eliminated.
     - Elimination events are printed in alphabetical order of player identifiers.
     - If the eliminated player was carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle remains at the elimination position.
   - **Catch Action**: If a player catches the Quaffle, the code incorrectly uses `==` instead of `=` to assign the player to `quidditch[1]`. This is a critical bug.
   - **Throw Action**: If a player throws the Quaffle, the Quaffle is released (`quidditch[1]` is set to an empty string).
     - The code checks if the player's position is in the opponent's goals and updates the score accordingly.
     - The Quaffle is moved to the middle of the field if the player scored in the correct goal.
     - If the player scored in their own goal, the Quaffle is moved to the player's position, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. It should always move to the middle of the field.

#### Output
5. **Printing Events**: The code prints elimination and scoring events as required.
6. **Final Score**: The final score is printed after processing all moves.

### Conclusion
The code has several issues:
- **Incorrect Assignment**: The use of `==` instead of `=` in the catch action will prevent the Quaffle from being assigned to the player correctly.
- **Incorrect Quaffle Positioning**: After a player scores in their own goal, the Quaffle should always move to the middle of the field, not to the player's position.

These issues mean that the program does not fully adhere to the problem requirements and may produce incorrect results.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
