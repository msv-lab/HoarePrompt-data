Correctness: **False**

The provided code has several issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Catching the Quaffle**: The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player who is catching the Quaffle.

2. **Incorrect Goal Scoring Logic**: The code checks if the player's position is in the goals list, but it doesn't handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal. This needs to be corrected to ensure the correct team scores when the Quaffle is placed in the opponent's goal.

3. **Quaffle Position Reset Logic**: When a goal is scored, the Quaffle should always be reset to the middle of the field, regardless of which player scored. The current code incorrectly sets the Quaffle to the player's position if the player scored in their own goal.

4. **Bludger Elimination Logic**: The code correctly identifies players to be eliminated when they collide with the Bludger, but it doesn't handle the case where multiple players are eliminated simultaneously. The sorting logic is correct, but the handling of the Quaffle when a player carrying it is eliminated is incorrect.

5. **Function Call Before Definition**: The function `func_1` is used before it is defined in the code. This will result in a `NameError`.

Here is a corrected version of the relevant parts of the code:

```python
# Function definition should be before usage
def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)

# Main logic
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[0] == '.Q':
        quidditch[0] = func_1(quidditch[0], mouvements[mo[1]])
    elif mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        if '.B' in players:
            elimines = []
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    elimines.append(k)
            elimines.sort()
            for c in elimines:
                print(i, c, 'ELIMINATED')
                if quidditch[1] == c:
                    quidditch = [players[c], '']
                del players[c]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]  # Corrected assignment
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R'] and mo[0][0] == 'B':
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle  # Always reset Quaffle to middle
        elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B'] and mo[0][0] == 'R':
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle  # Always reset Quaffle to middle
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

These corrections should make the program work as expected according to the problem description.
