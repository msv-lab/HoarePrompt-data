#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of lines in the field (3 ≤ a ≤ 99 and a is odd), b is an integer representing the number of columns in the field (3 ≤ b ≤ 99 and b is odd).
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns (`a + b1`, `a + b2`), where `a`, `b1`, and `b2` are all odd integers between 3 and 99.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a tuple `a` and a tuple `b` as input, where each tuple contains two integers. It returns a new tuple containing the sum of the first elements of `a` and `b`, and the sum of the second elements of `a` and `b`.
