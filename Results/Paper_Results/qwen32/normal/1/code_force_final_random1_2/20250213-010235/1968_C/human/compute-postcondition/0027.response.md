The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user input converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.**
