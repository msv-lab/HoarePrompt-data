To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to understand how the loop modifies the list `a`. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, updating each element `a[i]` based on the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element in the list `x`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the list `a` is updated:

1. Initially, `a[0]` is set to 1000.
2. For `i = 1`, `a[1]` is set to `a[0] + x[0]`.
3. For `i = 2`, `a[2]` is set to `a[1] + x[1]`.
4. This pattern continues until `i = n-1`, where `a[n-1]` is set to `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.

After the loop completes, the list `a` will have been fully populated according to the rule `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

Thus, the final output state of the list `a` can be described as follows:

- `a[0]` remains 1000.
- `a[i]` for `i > 0` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` up to `x[i-1]`, starting from `a[0]`.

Formally, `a[i] = 1000 + sum(x[0:i])` for `i > 0`.

Given the format requirement, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, the list `a` will have its first element as 1000, and each subsequent element `a[i]` will be the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list `x`.
