Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the input integer, `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` zeros except `a[0]` which is 1000.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `t` remains unchanged, as does `n` and the list `x`. The list `a` now has its first element set to 1000, while all other elements remain zero.
