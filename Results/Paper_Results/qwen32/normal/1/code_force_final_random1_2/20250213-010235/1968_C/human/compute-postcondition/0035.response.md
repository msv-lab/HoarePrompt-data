The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000, `a[1]` is `1000 + x[0]`, and `a[2]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`
- `i` is 2

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2. The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 3 (since the loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`).

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be 3
- `n` must still be greater than 2 (no change needed here)

The other variables (`t`, `x`, and `a`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000, `a[1]` is `1000 + x[0]`, and `a[2]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, `i` is 3**
