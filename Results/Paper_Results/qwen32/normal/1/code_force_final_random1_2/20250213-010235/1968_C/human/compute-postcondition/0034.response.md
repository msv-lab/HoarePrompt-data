Given the code snippet `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` and the initial state, we know:

- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000 and `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` for i > 0.
- `i` is 2.

Executing the code snippet updates the value of `a[i]` (which is `a[2]` in this case) to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[1]`) and `x[i - 1]` (which is `x[1]`). 

Since `a[1]` was previously calculated as `a[0] + x[0]` and `a[0]` is 1000, we have `a[1] = 1000 + x[0]`. Now, `a[2]` will be `a[1] + x[1]`, which translates to `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`.

Therefore, the updated value of `a[2]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 1000, `a[1]` is `1000 + x[0]`, and `a[2]` is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, `i` is 2.**
