Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers representing the counts of ones from lists `a` and `b` up to index `k`. Both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`.
- `t` is incremented by `k`.
- `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `newk` retain their initial values.
- `i` is set to `k + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It prints the string `'yes'`. The values of the variables `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, and `i` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a literal string `'yes'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
