Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 · min(n, m), a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where each element b_j satisfies 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6. The sum of values n and m over all test cases does not exceed 4 · 10^5.**
