Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` being at least 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `aOnes` is 0; `bOnes` is 0; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is 1; `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`; either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`; `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`.**
