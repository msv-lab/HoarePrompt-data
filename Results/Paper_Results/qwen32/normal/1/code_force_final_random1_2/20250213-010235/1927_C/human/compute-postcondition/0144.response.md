Postcondition: **`aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers, `t` has been incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their values from the input where `k` must be at least 2, `a` and `b` retain their input values, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
