Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input where `k` must be at least 1; `i` is 1; `aOnes` is 0; `t` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `newk` is `k // 2`; `i` is not present in `a`. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
