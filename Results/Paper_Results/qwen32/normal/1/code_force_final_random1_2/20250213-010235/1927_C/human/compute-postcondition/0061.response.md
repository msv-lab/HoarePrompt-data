The code snippet assigns the value of `k // 2` to `newk`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `t`, `a`, or `b`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input; `i` is `k + 1` or the value where the loop breaks; `aOnes` is 0; `bOnes` is 0; `t` is incremented by 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `newk` is `k // 2`.**
