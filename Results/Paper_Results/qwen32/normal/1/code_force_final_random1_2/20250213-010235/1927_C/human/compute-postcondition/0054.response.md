Postcondition: **`i` is `k + 1` or the value where the loop breaks, `aOnes` and `bOnes` reflect the number of increments that occurred during the loop. If both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, then the condition in the if statement is true. Otherwise, at least one of `aOnes` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.**
