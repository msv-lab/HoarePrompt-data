The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This operation does not affect the variables `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `newk`, or `t`. The only changes are the assignments to `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, at least one of `aOnes` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`. `t` is incremented by 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input.**
