Postcondition: **`aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers reflecting the counts from lists `a` and `b` up to `k`. `t` is incremented by `k`. `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `newk` retain their initial values. `i` is `k + 1`. If both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, the if part executes; otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.**
