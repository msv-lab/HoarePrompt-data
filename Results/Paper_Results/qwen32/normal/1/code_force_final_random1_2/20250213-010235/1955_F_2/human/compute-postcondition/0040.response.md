To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's break down the provided information and the code logic.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Loop Structure**:
   - The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each iteration, it reads a list `a` of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.
   
2. **Logic Inside Loop**:
   - It initializes `cnt` to 0.
   - Checks if the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd. If so, it increments `cnt` by 1.
   - For each element `x` in `a`, it adds `math.floor(x / 2)` to `cnt`.
   - Prints the value of `cnt`.

### Given Information:
- **Initial State**: Four non-negative integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \).
- **First Iteration Output State**: `cnt` is calculated as `math.floor(p_1 / 2) + math.floor(p_2 / 2) + math.floor(p_3 / 2) + math.floor(p_4 / 2)`. Additionally, if `p_1 == p_2 == p_3` and they are odd, `cnt` is incremented by 1.
- **Second Iteration Output State**: `final_cnt` (which is the same as the first iteration's `cnt` since the problem specifies no change).
- **Third Iteration Output State**: `cnt` is recalculated similarly, and `final_cnt` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
Since the problem states that `final_cnt` remains unchanged after the second and third iterations, we can infer that the value of `cnt` does not change across iterations. This implies that the input for each iteration is the same, and thus, the calculation for `cnt` remains consistent.

### Final Output State:
After all `t` iterations, the output state will be the same as the output state after the first iteration because the inputs for each iteration are identical and the logic inside the loop does not alter any external state beyond printing `cnt`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

In natural language, this means the final output state is the same as the output state after the first iteration, which is the calculated value of `cnt` based on the initial counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours, adjusted by the special condition if applicable.
