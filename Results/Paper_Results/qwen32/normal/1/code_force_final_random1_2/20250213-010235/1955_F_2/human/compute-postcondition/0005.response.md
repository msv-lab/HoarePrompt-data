Let's break down the given Python code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `p` is a list containing the nearest even integers less than or equal to the four input values.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Understanding `p`**:
   - `p` contains the nearest even integers less than or equal to four input values. This means every element in `p` is an even number.

2. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - The expression inside the `print` function consists of two parts:
     1. `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)`
     2. `sum(p) // 2`

3. **First Part: `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)`**:
   - `p[:3]` takes the first three elements of the list `p`.
   - `map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])` applies the lambda function to each of these three elements. Since `p` contains only even numbers, `x % 2` will always be `0`, making `x % 2 > 0` always `False`.
   - Converting `False` to an integer results in `0`. Therefore, `list(map(...))` will produce a list of three `0`s.
   - `sum([0, 0, 0])` equals `0`.
   - The comparison `(0 == 3)` evaluates to `False`.
   - Converting `False` to an integer results in `0`.

4. **Second Part: `sum(p) // 2`**:
   - `sum(p)` computes the sum of all elements in the list `p`.
   - Since `p` contains only even numbers, `sum(p)` will also be an even number.
   - Dividing an even number by `2` using integer division (`//`) will result in an integer.

5. **Combining Both Parts**:
   - The first part evaluates to `0`.
   - Adding this result to the second part (`sum(p) // 2`) gives us the final output.

### Final Output:
Given that the first part of the expression is always `0` due to the nature of `p` containing only even numbers, the output will simply be the integer division of the sum of `p` by `2`.

Output: **sum(p) // 2 (where sum(p) is the sum of all elements in the list p)**
