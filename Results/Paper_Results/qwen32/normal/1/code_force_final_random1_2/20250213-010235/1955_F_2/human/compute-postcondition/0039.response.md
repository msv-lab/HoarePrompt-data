To determine the output of the `print(cnt)` statement, let's break down the given initial state:

- `cnt` is calculated as `iterations * (k - 1) / 2`.
- `final_cnt` remains unchanged, but it is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.

Given that the exact values of `iterations` and `k` are not specified, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `cnt`. However, we can express `cnt` in terms of `iterations` and `k`.

Thus, the value of `cnt` is determined by the formula `iterations * (k - 1) / 2`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(cnt)` statement will be the result of this formula.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is iterations * (k - 1) / 2)**
