You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four non-negative integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on these counts. Specifically, it checks if exactly three of the first three counts are odd and adds this boolean condition (1 for true, 0 for false) to half the sum of all four counts rounded down to the nearest even number.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.
2. **Winning Condition**: Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is zero.
3. **Game Dynamics**: Eve removes one number at a time, reducing the sequence size by one each turn, until the sequence is empty.
4. **Key Insight**: 
   - XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if each bit position has an even number of 1s.
   - Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 have binary representations: `1`, `10`, `11`, and `100` respectively.
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to leave sequences where the XOR is zero.

### Observations:

- For Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be zero.
- If there are an odd number of 1s, 3s, or both, the XOR will be non-zero unless they are paired up.
- If there are an even number of 1s and 3s, and also an even number of 2s and 4s, the XOR will be zero.

### Strategy:

- If there are three odd counts among the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s, Bob can win exactly once (when no numbers are removed).
- Otherwise, Bob can win every other turn by ensuring that the remaining numbers have an even count of 1s and 3s.
- The total number of turns is equal to the total number of numbers, which is `p1 + p2 + p3 + p4`.
- Therefore, Bob can win `total_numbers // 2` times if he wins every other turn.

### Program Analysis:

Let's break down the given program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
2. **Transformation**: It transforms the counts by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2 (`int(x) - int(x) % 2`). This effectively makes all counts even, which is not useful for determining the parity of the counts.
3. **Odd Count Check**: It checks if there are exactly three odd counts among the first three counts (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`). If true, it adds 1 to the result.
4. **Total Wins Calculation**: It calculates the total number of wins as `sum(p) // 2`, which is the total number of numbers divided by 2.
5. **Output**: It prints the sum of the two values calculated above.

### Issues in the Program:

- The transformation step (`int(x) - int(x) % 2`) is incorrect and does not help in determining the parity of the counts.
- The check for exactly three odd counts among the first three counts is incorrect because it ignores the count of 4s, which can affect the XOR result.
- The logic for calculating the maximum number of times Bob can win is flawed.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
