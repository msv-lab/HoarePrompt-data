Let's break down the code step-by-step based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) are each the nearest even integer less than or equal to their original values.
- \( t \) is greater than 0 (though \( t \) is not used in the provided code snippet).

### Code Analysis:
```python
print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

#### Step 1: Evaluate the Lambda Function
The lambda function `lambda x: x % 2 > 0` checks if a number \( x \) is odd. It returns `True` if \( x \) is odd and `False` otherwise.

#### Step 2: Apply the Lambda Function to the First Three Elements of `p`
`map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])` applies the lambda function to the first three elements of the list `p`.

Since each of \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) is the nearest even integer less than or equal to its original value, they must be even numbers. Therefore, for any even number \( x \), \( x \% 2 \) equals 0, making the expression `x % 2 > 0` evaluate to `False`.

Thus, `map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])` will produce a list of `[False, False, False]`.

#### Step 3: Sum the Boolean Values
`sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))` converts the boolean values to integers (`False` becomes 0 and `True` becomes 1) and sums them up.

Since all values are `False`, the sum is `0`.

#### Step 4: Compare the Sum to 3
`(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` evaluates to `(0 == 3)`, which is `False`. In Python, `False` is equivalent to `0`.

#### Step 5: Calculate the Integer Division of the Sum of `p`
`sum(p) // 2` calculates the sum of all elements in `p` and performs integer division by 2.

Since \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) are even, their sum is also even, and integer division by 2 will yield an integer.

#### Step 6: Add the Results from Steps 4 and 5
The final expression to be printed is `0 + (sum(p) // 2)`, which simplifies to `sum(p) // 2`.

### Conclusion:
The code will print the result of `sum(p) // 2`, where `p` is a list of four even integers.

Output: **sum(p) // 2 (where p is a list of four even integers)**
