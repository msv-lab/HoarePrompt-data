Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to find the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins when the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is zero.

#### Key Observations:

1. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - XOR of two identical numbers is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Numbers and Their XOR:**
   - Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 have binary representations 01, 10, 11, and 100 respectively.
   - XOR of all numbers being even means that each bit position contributes an even number of 1s, resulting in 0.
   - If there is an odd number of any specific number, it affects the final XOR result.

3. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to create sequences where the XOR is zero.
   - This involves pairing numbers such that their XOR cancels out.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution attempts to count the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering pairs of numbers and a special condition involving an odd count of 1, 2, and 3.

#### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **Counting Pairs:**
   - `for x in a: cnt += math.floor(x / 2)`
     - This counts the number of pairs for each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4).
     - Each pair can be removed without affecting the XOR result, allowing Bob to win.

2. **Special Case for 1, 2, 3:**
   - `if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1: cnt += 1`
     - This checks if there is an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s.
     - If true, it adds one more win for Bob because removing one of these numbers will leave an even count, potentially leading to a zero XOR.

### Testing the Solution

Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Removing one of the 1s, 2s, or 3s leaves an even count of the other two, allowing Bob to win once.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Removing one 1 and one 3 leaves an even count of 2s and 4s, allowing Bob to win once.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Three pairs can be removed, allowing Bob to win three times.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Two pairs from 1s and 2s, plus the special case of odd counts of 1s and 2s, allowing Bob to win three times.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Output: `12`
   - Explanation: Nine pairs from 2s, 3s, and 4s, allowing Bob to win twelve times.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering pairs and the special case of odd counts of 1, 2, and 3.

**Correctness: True**
