The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which iterates over the elements in the list `a`. Therefore, we need to adjust `x` for the next iteration. Since `x` is the second element in the list `a` at the end of the previous iteration, it means that the current iteration has just finished processing the second element. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` should now be the third element in the list `a`.

The state of `a` and its length do not need to be adjusted because the loop will naturally move to the next element in the list. The variable `cnt` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted here.

State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list `a`**
