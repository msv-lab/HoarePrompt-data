The value of `cnt` is incremented by the floor division of `x` by 2. Since `x` is the first element in the list `a`, the value of `cnt` will increase by `math.floor(x / 2)`. The list `a` and the value of `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list `a`, `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`**.
