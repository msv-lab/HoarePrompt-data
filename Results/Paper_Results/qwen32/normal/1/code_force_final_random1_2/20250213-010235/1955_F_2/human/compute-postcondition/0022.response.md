Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list `a`, `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`**

Natural Language: The list `a` remains unchanged and still contains at least two integers. The variable `x` retains its value as the second element of the list `a`. The variable `cnt` is updated by adding the integer part of `x` divided by 2 (`math.floor(x / 2)`) to its previous value.
