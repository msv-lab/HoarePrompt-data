The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`. Given the initial state, `g` is initially equal to `int(n / count)`, and `countmins` is 1. After the operation, `g` becomes `int(n / count) - 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is equal to `n`; `i` is 1; `countmins` is 1; `g` is equal to `int(n / count) - 1`.**
