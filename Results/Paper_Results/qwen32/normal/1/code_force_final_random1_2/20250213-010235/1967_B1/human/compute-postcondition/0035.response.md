The code snippet assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. This means that the previous value of `ans` is overwritten by the value of `n`.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `count` is 2; `ans` is equal to `n`; `i` is 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` is now equal to `n`, while all other variables retain their original values.
