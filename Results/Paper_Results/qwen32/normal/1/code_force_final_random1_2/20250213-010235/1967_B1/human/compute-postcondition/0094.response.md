To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and accumulates results. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior and the final output state.

### Loop Behavior:
1. **Initialization**:
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read from the input.
   - `count` is initialized to 2.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `count` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
     - `g` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by `count`.
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
     - `ans` is incremented by the integer division of `g` by `count` plus 1.
     - `count` is incremented by 1.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop ends, the value of `ans` is printed.

### Final Output State:
After processing all `t` test cases, the loop will have executed once for each test case, updating `ans` based on the values of `n` and `m` for each test case. The final output state will be the accumulated results of all these test cases.

### Output State Format:
The output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is simply the final value of `ans` for each test case printed sequentially.

### Final Output State Description:
The final output state consists of `t` lines, each containing the final value of `ans` after processing each test case. This value is computed by starting with `n` and iteratively adding contributions based on the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **Each line contains the final value of `ans` after processing each test case.**

This means that for each of the `t` test cases, the loop computes a specific `ans` value based on the given `n` and `m`, and prints it out. The final output state is simply the sequence of these computed `ans` values, one per line.
