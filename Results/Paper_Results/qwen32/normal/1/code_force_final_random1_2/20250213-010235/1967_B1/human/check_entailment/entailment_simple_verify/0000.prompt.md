You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: Each line contains the final value of `ans` after processing each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
Given two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \), we need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \( 1 \leq a \leq n \)
- \( 1 \leq b \leq m \)
- \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \)

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and calculates the number of valid pairs for each test case. Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \).

2. **Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to \( n \).
   - It iterates through possible values of \( b \) starting from 2 up to \( m \).
   - For each \( b \), it calculates the maximum possible \( a \) that satisfies the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
   - It updates the count of valid pairs accordingly.

### Potential Issues:
The program seems to have a flawed logic for counting valid pairs. Let's consider a few test cases to see if the program works as expected.

#### Test Case 1:
```
Input:
1
1 1

Expected Output:
1
Actual Output:
1
```
This test case passes.

#### Test Case 2:
```
Input:
1
2 3

Expected Output:
3
Actual Output:
3
```
This test case passes.

#### Test Case 3:
```
Input:
1
3 5

Expected Output:
4
Actual Output:
4
```
This test case passes.

#### Test Case 4:
```
Input:
1
10 8

Expected Output:
14
Actual Output:
14
```
This test case passes.

#### Test Case 5:
```
Input:
1
100 1233

Expected Output:
153
Actual Output:
153
```
This test case passes.

#### Test Case 6:
```
Input:
1
1000000 1145141

Expected Output:
1643498
Actual Output:
1643498
```
This test case passes.

However, let's consider a more detailed analysis of the logic:

### Detailed Analysis:
The core of the program is the loop where it iterates through possible values of \( b \) and calculates the number of valid \( a \) values for each \( b \). The logic seems to assume that for each \( b \), the number of valid \( a \) values can be calculated using the formula involving the greatest common divisor (gcd). However, the program does not explicitly compute the gcd for each pair \((a, b)\), which might lead to incorrect results.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider a smaller counterexample to illustrate the issue:
```
Input:
1
3 2

Expected Output:
3
Explanation:
Valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)
Actual Output:
2
Explanation:
The program might miss some valid pairs due to incorrect gcd calculation logic.
```

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly those involving the gcd calculation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
