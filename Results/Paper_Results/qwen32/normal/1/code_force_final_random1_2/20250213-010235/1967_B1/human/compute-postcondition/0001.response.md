In this case, the for loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variables `n` and `m` are mentioned as being read inside the loop, but they are not part of the loop's head, so we cannot adjust them directly to ensure the loop executes.

Given the loop:

```python
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, but its initial value is implicitly determined by the `range(t)` function. Therefore, the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The values of `n` and `m` are not relevant to the decision of whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be at least 1**
