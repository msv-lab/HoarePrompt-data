To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's carefully analyze the problem statement and the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Code Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code and see if it correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

#### Key Points in the Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`. This seems to account for the pairs where \(b = 1\), because for any \(a\) from 1 to \(n\), \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\).

2. **Loop through possible values of \(b\)**:
   - The loop starts with `count = 2` and goes up to `m`.
   - For each `count` (which represents \(b\)), it calculates `g = int(n / count)`, which is the maximum possible value of \(a\) such that \(a \leq n\) and \(a\) is a multiple of `count`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - It then checks if `g < countmins` (where `countmins` is `count - 1`). If true, it breaks out of the loop. This condition is not clearly explained but seems to be a heuristic to stop further iterations when `g` becomes too small.
   - If not, it adjusts `g` by subtracting `countmins` and adds `int(g / count) + 1` to `ans`.

### Issues with the Code:
- **Logic for Counting Pairs**: The core logic for counting valid pairs \((a, b)\) is not correctly implemented. The formula used to calculate the number of valid `a` for each `b` does not align with the problem requirements.
- **Handling of GCD**: The code does not explicitly compute the GCD of `a` and `b` for each pair, which is crucial for determining if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- **Efficiency Concerns**: The approach might not be efficient enough to handle the upper limits of \(n\) and \(m\) as specified in the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the logic and handling of the problem requirements, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
