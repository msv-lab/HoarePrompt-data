Output State: **`t` must be at least 2; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n`; `i` is 2; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n // 2`. Additionally, `g` is less than `countmins`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
