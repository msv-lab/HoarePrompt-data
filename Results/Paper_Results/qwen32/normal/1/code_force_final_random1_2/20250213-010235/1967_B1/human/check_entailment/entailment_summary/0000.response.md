Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`. It then iterates through values of `count` up to `m`, calculating the number of valid pairs for each `count` value. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `count` starts at 2 because the case `b=1` is already counted in `ans=n`.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n` because every pair `(a, 1)` is valid since `a + 1` is always a multiple of `1`.

2. **Loop**:
   - For each `count` from 2 to `m`, it calculates `g` as the integer division of `n` by `count`.
   - If `g` is less than `count - 1`, it breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it adjusts `g` by subtracting `count - 1` and adds the integer division of `g` by `count` plus 1 to `ans`.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are some issues:
- The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not directly checked or used in the program.
- The logic for counting valid pairs seems arbitrary and does not align with the problem statement.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds true. This can be done using nested loops or more efficient methods involving mathematical properties.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as per the requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
