The code assigns the value of `int(n / count)` to the variable `g`. Given that `count` is 2, `g` will be the integer division of `n` by 2.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is equal to `n`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is equal to `int(n / 2)`.**
