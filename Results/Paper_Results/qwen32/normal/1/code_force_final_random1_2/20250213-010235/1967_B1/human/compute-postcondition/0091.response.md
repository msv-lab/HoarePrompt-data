Output State: **`t` must be at least 2; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` must be at least 3; `count` is 4; `ans` is `n + int((n // 2 - 1) / 2) + 2 * int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 3`; `i` is 2; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `int(n / 3) - 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
