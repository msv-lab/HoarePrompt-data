Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is equal to `n`; `i` is 1; `countmins` is 1; `g` is equal to `int(n / count)`**.

Explanation: The value of `g` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by `count`. All other variables retain their initial values.
