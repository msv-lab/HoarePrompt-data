The given code snippet modifies the value of `ans` by adding the result of `int(g / count) + 1` to it. Here's the updated state:

- `t` must be at least 2 (unchanged).
- `n` is an integer obtained from the input (unchanged).
- `m` must be at least 2 (unchanged).
- `count` is 2 (unchanged).
- `ans` is now `n + int(g / count) + 1`.
- `i` is 2 (unchanged).
- `countmins` is 1 (unchanged).
- `g` is `n // 2 - 1` (unchanged).

Since `g` is calculated as `n // 2 - 1` and `count` is 2, the expression `int(g / count) + 1` simplifies to `int((n // 2 - 1) / 2) + 1`.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 2; `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n + int((n // 2 - 1) / 2) + 1`; `i` is 2; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n // 2 - 1`.**
