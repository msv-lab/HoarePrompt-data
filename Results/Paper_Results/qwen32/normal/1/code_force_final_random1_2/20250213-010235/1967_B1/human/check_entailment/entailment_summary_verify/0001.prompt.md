You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value `ans` based on the given `n` and `m`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements step-by-step.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
The program provided seems to attempt solving the problem using a loop that iterates through possible values of `b` starting from 2 up to `m`. Here's a breakdown of what the program does:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
3. It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`.
4. It enters a loop where `count` goes from 2 to `m`.
   - For each `count`, it calculates `g` as `int(n / count)`.
   - It checks if `g` is less than `count - 1`. If so, it breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates `g` by subtracting `count - 1` from it.
   - It then adds `int(g / count) + 1` to `ans`.
5. Finally, it prints `ans`.

### Issues in the Program:
The logic in the program does not correctly implement the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Let's consider why this might be incorrect:

- The program assumes that for each `b`, the number of valid `a` values can be determined by the formula `int(n / count) - (count - 1)`, which is not necessarily true.
- The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not directly checked in the loop. Instead, the program uses a heuristic that doesn't guarantee correctness for all cases.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with one of the examples provided:

For the test case `n = 10`, `m = 8`:
- The program initializes `ans` to `10` (since `n = 10`).
- It then enters the loop starting from `count = 2` up to `m = 8`.
- For `count = 2`, it calculates `g = int(10 / 2) = 5`. Since `5 >= 1`, it updates `g` to `5 - 1 = 4` and adds `int(4 / 2) + 1 = 3` to `ans`, making `ans = 13`.
- This process continues for `count` up to `8`, but the additions do not align with the actual number of valid pairs.

The actual valid pairs for `n = 10`, `m = 8` are:
- (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2) which totals 14 pairs.

Since the program does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs, we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as per the given requirements.

Correctness: **False**
