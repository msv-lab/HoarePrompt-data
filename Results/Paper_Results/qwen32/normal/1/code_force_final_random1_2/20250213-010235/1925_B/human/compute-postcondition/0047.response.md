The code updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the result of `x // i`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`
- `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i_prev + 1` if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`.

After executing the line `ans = max(ans, x // i)`, the value of `ans` changes based on the comparison between its current value and `x // i`.

Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`. If `x // i` is greater than the current `ans`, then `ans` is updated to `x // i`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
