The code snippet `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the value of `ans`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\); `n` is an integer read from the input; `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
