Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\); `n` is an integer read from the input; `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i` if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`; otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value; `i` is incremented by 1.**
