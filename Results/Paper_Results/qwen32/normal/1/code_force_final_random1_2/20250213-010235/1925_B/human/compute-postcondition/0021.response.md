The code updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the integer division of `x` by `i`. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified elsewhere in the code.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\); `n` is an integer read from the input; `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
