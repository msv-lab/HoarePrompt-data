Output State: **`ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `i`; `q` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `x` is an integer from the input that must be at least 1; `n` is the second integer from the input; `x` is divisible by `i`; and `x - n * i` is non-negative and also divisible by `i`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `i`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
