You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):

                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //

        print(ans)
        
    #State: For each of the `t` test cases, the output will be the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`, or 1 if no such divisor exists.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and verify its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to split a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
- The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`, it checks if it's possible to form `n` sub-problems with difficulty `i` such that their total difficulty sums up to `x`. It also checks the corresponding divisor `x // i`.

### Key Points:
1. **Divisor Check**: The program checks both `i` and `x // i` as potential divisors.
2. **Feasibility Check**: For each divisor `i`, it checks if `(x - n * i)` is divisible by `i` and non-negative. This ensures that we can distribute the remaining difficulty (`x - n * i`) evenly among the sub-problems.
3. **Maximizing GCD**: The program keeps track of the maximum divisor that satisfies the above conditions.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Small Values**: Test with small values of `x` and `n` to ensure the basic functionality works.
- **Large Values**: Test with large values of `x` and `n` to ensure the program handles them efficiently.
- **Edge Conditions**: Test with edge conditions like `x = n`, `x = 1`, and `n = 1`.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider the provided examples and some additional edge cases:

#### Provided Examples:
1. **Input**: `10 3`
   - **Output**: `2`
   - **Explanation**: Possible sub-problems: `[4, 2, 4]` with GCD `2`.
   
2. **Input**: `5 5`
   - **Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: Only possible sub-problems: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with GCD `1`.
   
3. **Input**: `420 69`
   - **Output**: `6`
   - **Explanation**: Possible sub-problems: `[6, 6, 6, ..., 6]` with GCD `6`.

#### Additional Edge Cases:
1. **Input**: `1 1`
   - **Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: Only possible sub-problem: `[1]` with GCD `1`.
   
2. **Input**: `100 1`
   - **Output**: `100`
   - **Explanation**: Only possible sub-problem: `[100]` with GCD `100`.
   
3. **Input**: `100 100`
   - **Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: Only possible sub-problems: `[1, 1, 1, ..., 1]` with GCD `1`.

### Conclusion:
After testing the program with various inputs, including edge cases, it appears to correctly compute the maximum balance for each test case. The logic seems sound, and no counterexamples were found where the program fails to meet the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The program efficiently finds the maximum GCD by iterating through possible divisors and checking if they can form valid sub-problems. It handles both small and large inputs correctly and ensures that the sum of the sub-problems' difficulties equals `x`.
