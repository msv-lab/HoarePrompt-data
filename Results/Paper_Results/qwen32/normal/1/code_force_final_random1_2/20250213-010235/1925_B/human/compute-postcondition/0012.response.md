To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the implicit upper limit derived from `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has some value, and we need to increment it for the next iteration. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value, say `k`.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.
3. **Condition Check**: The loop will continue if `k + 1 < int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, which simplifies to `k < int(sqrt(x))`.

### Adjustments:
- **Variable `i`**: Increment `i` by 1.
- **Other Variables**: The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `ans` do not change based on the loop head.

### Final State:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- Other variables remain unchanged.

### Example Calculation:
If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\); `n` is an integer read from the input; `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i` and `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`; otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we generalize the increment:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\); `n` is an integer read from the input; `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i` and `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`; otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value; `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more specific, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\); `n` is an integer read from the input; `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i` and `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`; otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value; `i` is `k + 1`**.

Given the generic nature of the task, the most accurate answer without specific values is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` is an integer such that \(x \geq 1\); `n` is an integer read from the input; `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i` and `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`; otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value; `i` is incremented by 1**.
