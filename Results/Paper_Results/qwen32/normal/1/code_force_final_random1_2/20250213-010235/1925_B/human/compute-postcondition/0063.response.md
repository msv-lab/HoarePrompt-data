Postcondition: **`x` is an integer that must be at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions, or 1 if no such divisor exists, `q` is `q + 1`. If `x % i == 0`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i)` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
