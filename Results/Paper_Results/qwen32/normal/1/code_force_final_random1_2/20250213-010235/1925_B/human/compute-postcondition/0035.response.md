Output State: **`ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`; `q` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `x` remains an integer from the input that must be at least 1, `n` remains the second integer from the input, and `x` is divisible by `i`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i`. The value of `q` is increased by 1. The values of `x`, `n`, and the condition that `x` is divisible by `i` remain unchanged.
