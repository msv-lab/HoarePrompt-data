The code snippet modifies the value of `mex` by subtracting the value of `ar[i]` from it. Given that `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, the value of `ar[i]` is `ar[len(ar) - 3]`. Therefore, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `res`) remain unchanged except for `mex`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element (specifically `res[len(ar) - 3]`) is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, and `mex` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`.**
