The given code modifies the value of `mex` by subtracting the `i`-th element of the list `ar` from it. Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `ar` remains the same list of integers obtained from the input.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is now `mex - ar[i]` and other elements are `None`.
- `i` remains `len(ar) - 2`.
- `mex` is now `mex - ar[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is now `mex - ar[i]` and other elements are `None`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`.**
