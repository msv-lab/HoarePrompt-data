To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
```

This means the loop iterates over the indices of the list `ar` in reverse order, starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.

### Analysis:
- **`i`**: This variable is the loop index, which will take values from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`. Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to `len(ar) - 1`.
- **`ar`**: The list over which the loop iterates. For the loop to execute, `ar` must have at least one element.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure `ar` has at least one element so that `len(ar) - 1` is a valid index.
- Set `i` to `len(ar) - 1` before the loop starts.

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `n` is an input integer (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input (This needs to have at least one element).
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `None` (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `mex` is `n` (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).

### Final Adjusted State:
- `ar` must have at least one element.
- `i` should be set to `len(ar) - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `None`, `mex` is `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`**
