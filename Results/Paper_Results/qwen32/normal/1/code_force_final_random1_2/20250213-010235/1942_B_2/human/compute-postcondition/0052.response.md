The code snippet modifies the value of `mex` by subtracting the value of `ar[i]` from it. Given that `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, the value of `ar[i]` is `ar[len(ar) - 2]`. Therefore, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`.

Since `res[len(ar) - 2]` is initially defined as `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, after the operation, `mex` will be equal to `res[len(ar) - 2]`.

Other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `mex` is `res[len(ar) - 2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`.**
