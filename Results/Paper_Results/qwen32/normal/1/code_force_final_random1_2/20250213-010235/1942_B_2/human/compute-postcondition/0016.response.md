Given the code snippet `mex = mex - ar[i]`, we know that the value of `mex` will be updated based on the current value of `mex` and the value of `ar[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, and `res` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified.

Here's the breakdown of the changes:
- `mex` is recalculated as `mex - ar[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the new value of `mex` while keeping other variables as they were initially described.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`th element is now `mex - ar[i]`, `i` is `x - 2`, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.**
