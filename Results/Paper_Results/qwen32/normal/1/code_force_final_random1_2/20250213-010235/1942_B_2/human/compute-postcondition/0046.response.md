The code snippet assigns the value of `mex - ar[i]` to `res[i]`. Given the initial state, `res` was a list of `n` `None` values, and now one of those values (specifically `res[i]`) has been updated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are `None`, and `mex` is `n`.**
