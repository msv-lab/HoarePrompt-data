The code assigns the value of `mex - ar[i]` to `res[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, and `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element was initially `n - ar[i]` and other elements are `None`.

After executing the line `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`, the `i`-th element of `res` changes from `n - ar[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `mex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is now `mex - ar[i]` and other elements are `None`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `mex` is unchanged.**
