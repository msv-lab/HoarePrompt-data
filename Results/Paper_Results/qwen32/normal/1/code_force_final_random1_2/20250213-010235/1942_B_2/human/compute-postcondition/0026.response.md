The code assigns the value of `mex - ar[i]` to `res[i]`. Given that `mex` is initially `n`, and `ar[i]` is the last element of the list `ar`, the value of `res[i]` will be `n - ar[i]`.

Here is the updated state:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `ar` remains the list of integers obtained from the input.
- `res` now has its `i`-th element set to `n - ar[i]`, while other elements remain `None`.
- `mex` remains `n`.
- `i` remains `len(ar) - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `n - ar[i]` and other elements are `None`, `mex` is `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`.**
