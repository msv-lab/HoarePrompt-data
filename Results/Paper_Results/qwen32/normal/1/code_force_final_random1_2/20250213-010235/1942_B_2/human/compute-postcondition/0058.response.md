To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `res` and `mex`.

The loop iterates over the list `ar` in reverse order (from the last element to the first). For each element `ar[i]` in `ar`, it calculates `mex - ar[i]` and assigns it to `res[i]`. If `mex - ar[i]` is less than `mex`, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the loop's effect on the variables:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `n` `None` values.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop starts from the last index (`len(ar) - 1`) and goes to the first index (`0`).
   - For each index `i`, it computes `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`.
   - If `mex - ar[i] < mex`, it updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]`.

After all iterations, `res` will contain the computed values for each index, and `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `ar` after considering the subtractions.

**Final Output State**:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `ar` remains unchanged.
- `res` will be a list where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` at the time of computation, and `mex` is updated accordingly during each iteration.
- `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that has not been "used" in the sense that no element in `ar` can reduce `mex` further.

Given the above logic, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list of `n` values where each `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` at the time of computation, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the transformed list `ar` after the loop.**

In simpler terms, `res` contains the differences between `mex` and each element of `ar` in reverse order, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been "used" up by any subtraction during the loop.
