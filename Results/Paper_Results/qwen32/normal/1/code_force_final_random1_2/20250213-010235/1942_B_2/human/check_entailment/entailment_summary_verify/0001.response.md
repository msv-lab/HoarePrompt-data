To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the logic and compare it with the problem requirements and the given function summary.

### Problem Recap:
We need to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The `MEX` function returns the smallest non-negative integer not present in the given set.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program iterates through the array `a` in reverse order and constructs the permutation `p` using the formula `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`. It also updates the `mex` value accordingly.

#### Key Points:
1. **Reverse Iteration**: The program processes the array `a` from the last element to the first. This approach is based on the idea that the `mex` value for the entire permutation can be determined by the end of the array, and then we can work backward.
2. **Updating `mex`**: The `mex` variable is initialized to `n` (the maximum possible value of `mex` for a permutation of size `n`). As we construct the permutation from the end, we update `mex` to be the minimum value that hasn't been used yet.
3. **Constructing `p`**: For each element in `a`, the corresponding element in `p` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`. This ensures that the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` is satisfied.

### Verification:
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `n=5`, `a=[1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
   - Output: `p=[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`
   - Verification:
     - `a_5 = MEX([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2` (but actually `a_5 = 2`)
     - `a_4 = MEX([0, 1, 4, 2]) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1`
     - `a_3 = MEX([0, 1, 4]) - 4 = 2 - 4 = -2`
     - `a_2 = MEX([0, 1]) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`
     - `a_1 = MEX([0]) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1`
   - The output satisfies the conditions.

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `n=5`, `a=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Output: `p=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Verification:
     - `a_5 = MEX([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1`
     - `a_4 = MEX([0, 1, 2, 3]) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1`
     - `a_3 = MEX([0, 1, 2]) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1`
     - `a_2 = MEX([0, 1]) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`
     - `a_1 = MEX([0]) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1`
   - The output satisfies the conditions.

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `n=3`, `a=[-2, 1, 2]`
   - Output: `p=[2, 0, 1]`
   - Verification:
     - `a_3 = MEX([2, 0, 1]) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`
     - `a_2 = MEX([2, 0]) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1`
     - `a_1 = MEX([2]) - 2 = 0 - 2 = -2`
   - The output satisfies the conditions.

### Detailed Reasoning:
The program uses a reverse iteration approach to construct the permutation `p`. The key idea is to start with the highest possible `mex` value (`n`) and work backward, ensuring that the `mex` value is correctly updated as elements of `p` are assigned. The formula `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` ensures that the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` holds true.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic. The program does not ensure that the `mex` value is correctly updated after assigning each element of `p`. Specifically, the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]:` is incorrect and does not properly update the `mex` value. Instead, the program should maintain a set of used numbers and find the smallest unused number (i.e., the `mex`) after each assignment.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve maintaining a set of used numbers and finding the smallest unused number (i.e., the `mex`) after each assignment. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            used.add(res[i])
        
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for updating the `mex` value. The provided function summary does not fully capture this issue, leading to an inaccurate assessment.

Final: **False**
