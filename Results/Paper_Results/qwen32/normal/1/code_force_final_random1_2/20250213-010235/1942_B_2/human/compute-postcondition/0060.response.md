To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `ar` of `n` integers. It then computes a result list `res` where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`, and `mex` is updated accordingly.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, `mex` is initialized to `n`.
2. **Processing**: The loop iterates over the array `ar` from the last element to the first. For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`. If `mex - ar[i]` is less than the current `mex`, it updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]`.
3. **Output**: After processing all elements in `ar`, the result list `res` is printed.

After all `t` test cases are processed, the final output state will consist of the results of each test case printed one after another.

### Final Output State Description
The final output state is a series of lines, each corresponding to the result list `res` for each test case. Each line contains `n` space-separated integers representing the computed values of `res[i]` for that particular test case.

### Final Output State Format
Output State: **Each line corresponds to the result list `res` for each test case, with each element separated by a space.**

This means that after all iterations, the output will be a sequence of lines, each containing the results of the computations for a single test case.

### Example
If there are two test cases with inputs:
- Test Case 1: `n = 3`, `ar = [1, 2, 3]`
- Test Case 2: `n = 4`, `ar = [0, 1, 2, 3]`

The output would look like:
```
2 1 0
4 3 2 1
```

This output indicates the results of the computations for each test case, with each line corresponding to one test case.

Thus, the final output state is described as follows:
Output State: **Each line corresponds to the result list `res` for each test case, with each element separated by a space.**
