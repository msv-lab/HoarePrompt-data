The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates over the indices of the list `ar` in reverse order, starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (this does not change as it is not part of the loop head).
- `n` is the input integer (this does not change as it is not part of the loop head).
- `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input (this does not change as it is not part of the loop head).
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise it remains `None` (this does not change as it is not part of the loop head).
- `i` is `len(ar) - 2` (this needs to be adjusted).
- `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]` (this does not change as it is not part of the loop head).

Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `len(ar) - 3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise it remains `None`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, and `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`**.
