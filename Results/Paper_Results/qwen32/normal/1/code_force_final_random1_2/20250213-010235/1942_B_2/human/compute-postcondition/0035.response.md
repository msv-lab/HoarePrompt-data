The code snippet assigns the value `mex - ar[i]` to `res[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is specifically `len(ar) - 3`. Therefore, the `i`-th element of `res` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`.

If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, the condition holds true because subtracting a positive number (`ar[i]`) from `mex` will always make `mex - ar[i]` smaller than `mex`. Hence, `res[i]` will be set to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`.

The value of `mex` is not updated in this code snippet, so it remains the same. The value of `ar` and `n` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element (specifically `res[len(ar) - 3]`) is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, and `mex` is unchanged.**
