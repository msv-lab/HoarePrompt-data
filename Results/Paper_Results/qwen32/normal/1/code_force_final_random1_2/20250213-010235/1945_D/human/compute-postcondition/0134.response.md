Output State: **`c` is `c + 2`, `cases` is greater than `c + 2`, `na_frente` is an integer from the input that must be at least 1, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a new list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers from the input, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged except for `total`, which now includes the additional cost specified by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The condition for updating `best` remains the same, meaning `best` will either stay the same or be updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` depending on the comparison.
