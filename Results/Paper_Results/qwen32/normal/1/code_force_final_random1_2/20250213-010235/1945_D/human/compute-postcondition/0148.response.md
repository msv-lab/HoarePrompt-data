Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, and `custo` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `max_p` is updated to the integer value of `nf[1]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
