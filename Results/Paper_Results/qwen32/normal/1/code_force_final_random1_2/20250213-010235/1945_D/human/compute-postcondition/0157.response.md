To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop processes each element in the list `a`. The loop iterates over each element `y` in the list `a`, converts it to an integer, and appends it to the list `a_values`. 

Given the pattern observed in the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue this process until all elements in `a` have been processed. Therefore, after all iterations, `a_values` will contain all the integer values from the list `a`.

Here's the final output state:

- `i` is incremented by 1 (remains incremented as per the initial state description).
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`.
- `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`.
- `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`.
- `b_values` remains an empty list.
- `nf` is a list of substrings from the input.
- `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
- `b` is a list of substrings from the new input.
- `custo` remains 0.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, and `custo` is 0.**
