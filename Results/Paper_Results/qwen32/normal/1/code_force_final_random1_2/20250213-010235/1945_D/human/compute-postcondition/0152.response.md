The code appends the integer value of `y` to the list `a_values`. Since `a_values` was initially an empty list, it now contains one element, which is the integer value of `y`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer value of `y`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, and `custo` is 0.**
