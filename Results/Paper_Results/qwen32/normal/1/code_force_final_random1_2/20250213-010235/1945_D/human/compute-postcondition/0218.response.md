Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (with `m` â‰¤ `n`), and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates a cost based on specific conditions involving the elements of `a` and `b`, and prints the calculated cost.**
