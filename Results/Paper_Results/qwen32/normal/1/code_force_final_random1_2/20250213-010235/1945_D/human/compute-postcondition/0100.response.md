Output State: **`c` is `c + 2`, `cases` is greater than `c + 2`, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a new list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers from the input, `total` is the accumulated sum of the smallest costs, `best` is the minimum cost found when `v <= pos_final`.**

Explanation: The only change is that `pos_final` has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
