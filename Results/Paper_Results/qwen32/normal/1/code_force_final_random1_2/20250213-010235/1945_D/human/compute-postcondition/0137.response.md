Output State: **`c` is `c + 2`, `cases` is greater than `c + 2`, `na_frente` is an integer from the input that must be at least 1, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a new list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers from the input, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The value of `total` is updated by adding the element at index `v` (which is `na_frente - 2`) from the list `custo_pra_passar_b`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
