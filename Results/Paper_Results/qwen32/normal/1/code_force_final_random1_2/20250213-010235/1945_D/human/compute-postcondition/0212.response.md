The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which iterates over the elements of the list `custos`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `custos` and how the loop progresses.

Given:
- `custos` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer.
- `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `x` remain unchanged.

At the end of the previous iteration, `c` would have taken the value of the last element that was processed from `custos`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `custos` to process.

Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `c` took the value of the first element in `custos`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `c` should take the value of the second element in `custos`.

State: **`custos` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `x` remain unchanged, `c` is the second element in `custos`**
