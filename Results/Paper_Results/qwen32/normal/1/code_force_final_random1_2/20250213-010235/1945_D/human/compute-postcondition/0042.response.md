Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is greater than or equal to 1; `na_frente` is an integer read from the input minus 1 (ensuring `na_frente` is at least 0); `pos_final` is an integer read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input; `v` is `v - 1`; `total` is `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `total` has been updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to it. All other variables retain their initial values.
