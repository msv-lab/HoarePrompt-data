Output State: **`c` is `c + 1`, `cases` is greater than `c + 1`, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1 (and is at least 0), `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it. All other variables retain their previous values.
