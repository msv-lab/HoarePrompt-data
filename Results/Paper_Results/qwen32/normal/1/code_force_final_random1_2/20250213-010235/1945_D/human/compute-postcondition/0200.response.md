The given code snippet increments the `custo` variable by the value of `b_values[y]`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `custo`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, `custo` is incremented by `b_values[y]`, and `y` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration + 1.**

In simpler terms, `custo` has been increased by the value of `b_values[y]`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
