To determine what will be printed by the `print(best)` statement, we need to know the value or definition of the variable `best` from the initial state. However, the provided initial state does not include any information about the variable `best`.

Given the lack of information about the variable `best`, it is impossible to determine its exact value or definition. Therefore, the most precise description we can provide is that the print statement will output whatever value `best` holds.

Output: **best (where best is the value of the variable best)**
