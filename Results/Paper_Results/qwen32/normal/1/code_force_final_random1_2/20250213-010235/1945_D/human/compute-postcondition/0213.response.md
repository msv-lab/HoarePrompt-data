Given the initial state, we know that `custos` is a list of integers with at least two integers. The variable `c` is explicitly defined as the second element in the `custos` list. This means `c` holds the value of `custos[1]`.

Since the exact values of the integers in the `custos` list are not specified, we cannot determine the precise numerical value of `c`. However, we know that `c` is the second element of the `custos` list.

Therefore, the `print(c)` statement will output the second element of the `custos` list.

Output: **c (where c is the second element of the custos list)**
