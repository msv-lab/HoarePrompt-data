Output State: **`custos` is a list of integers that must have `x` integers, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `x` remain unchanged, `c` is the last element in `custos`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `custos` list will have printed all its elements one by one, from the first to the last. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `x` will remain unchanged as they were before the loop started. The variable `c` will hold the value of the last element in the `custos` list at the end of the loop's execution.
