The only object in the loop head is the variable `c`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `custos`. If the list has at least 3 integers, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `custos` has at least 2 integers, and `c` is the second element in `custos`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `custos` must have at least 3 integers, and `c` should be the third element in `custos`.

State: **`custos` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `x` remain unchanged, `c` is the third element in `custos`**
