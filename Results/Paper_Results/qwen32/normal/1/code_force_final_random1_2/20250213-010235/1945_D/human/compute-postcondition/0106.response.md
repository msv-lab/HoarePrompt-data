Output State: **`c` is `c + 2`, `cases` is greater than `c + 2`, `na_frente` is an integer from the input that must be at least 1, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a new list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers from the input, `total` is 0, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. Additionally, `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `best` has been updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
