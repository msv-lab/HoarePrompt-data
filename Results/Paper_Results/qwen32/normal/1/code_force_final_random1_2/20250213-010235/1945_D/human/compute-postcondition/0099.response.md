The code snippet `na_frente -= 1` decrements the value of `na_frente` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is `c + 2`, `cases` is greater than `c + 2`, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a new list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers from the input, `total` is the accumulated sum of the smallest costs, `best` is the minimum cost found when `v <= pos_final`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `na_frente` is reduced by 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
