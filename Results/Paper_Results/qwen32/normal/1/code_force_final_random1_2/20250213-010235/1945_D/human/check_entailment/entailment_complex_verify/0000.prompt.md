You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    #State: The loop has executed `cases` number of times. For each iteration, `c` ranges from 0 to `cases-1`. For each case, `na_frente` and `pos_final` are adjusted by subtracting 1 from their respective input values. `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers read from the input. The variable `total` accumulates the sum of the smallest costs encountered during the inner loop, and `best` keeps track of the minimum cost found when `v <= pos_final`. After processing all cases, the final output consists of the minimum costs for each case printed sequentially.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (with `m` ≤ `n`), and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost required to reach a specified position `m` from position `n` by either passing through elements in list `b` or swapping to elements in list `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position within the first `m` positions in the queue. Let's analyze why:

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation Logic**:
   - The program iterates from the end of the queue towards the front, calculating the total cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
   - However, the logic for adding costs is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:` is not correctly determining which cost to add. It should consider the cost to swap with the person at position `v` and the costs to pass through all intermediate positions `k` such that `j < k < i`.

2. **Handling of Intermediate Costs (`b_k`)**:
   - The program incorrectly adds `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to the total cost without considering the actual range of positions `k` that Kirill would need to pass through to reach position `v`.
   - The correct approach should involve maintaining a running total of the costs `b_k` for all positions `k` that Kirill passes through when moving from his current position to position `v`.

3. **Initialization and Best Cost Tracking**:
   - The variable `best` is initialized to a very large value (`10 ** 12`), which is fine, but the way `best` is updated does not correctly reflect the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` positions.
   - The update `if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:` only considers the cost to swap with the person at position `v` but does not account for the cumulative cost of passing through intermediate positions.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following test case:

```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

- **Expected Output**: `14`
- **Explanation**: To reach position 1 (one of the first 2 positions), Kirill can swap with the person at position 2 (cost 3) and then pass through the person at position 1 (cost 4). Total cost = 3 + 4 = 7. However, to ensure the minimum cost, Kirill should swap with the person at position 2 (cost 3) and then swap with the person at position 1 (cost 7). Total cost = 3 + 7 = 10. But the optimal solution involves swapping with the person at position 3 (cost 6) and then passing through the person at position 2 (cost 3) and the person at position 1 (cost 4). Total cost = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13. However, the optimal solution is actually swapping with the person at position 2 (cost 3) and then passing through the person at position 1 (cost 4) and then swapping with the person at position 1 again (cost 7). Total cost = 3 + 4 + 7 = 14.

The provided program does not handle these intermediate costs correctly, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend in all cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
