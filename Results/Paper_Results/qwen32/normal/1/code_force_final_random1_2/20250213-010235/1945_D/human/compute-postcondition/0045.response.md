Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` is greater than or equal to 1; `na_frente` is an integer read from the input minus 1 (ensuring `na_frente` is at least 0); `pos_final` is an integer read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input; `v` is `v - 1`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; otherwise, `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. Additionally, if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is greater than the current `best`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; otherwise, `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
