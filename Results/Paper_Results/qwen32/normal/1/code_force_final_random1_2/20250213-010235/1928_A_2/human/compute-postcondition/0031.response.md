Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, and `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1. Regardless of the values of `a` and `b`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

This postcondition captures the fact that the value of `i` is always incremented by 1 after the execution of the if-else block, while the values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
