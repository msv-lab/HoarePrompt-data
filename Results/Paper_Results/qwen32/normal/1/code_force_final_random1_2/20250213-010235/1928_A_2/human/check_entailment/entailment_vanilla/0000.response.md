Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob starts with a rectangle of dimensions \(a \times b\) and wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles such that he can rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one (considering rotations).

#### Key Observations:
1. **If either dimension is 1**: It's impossible to form a new rectangle since cutting a \(1 \times n\) rectangle results in two \(1 \times m\) rectangles, which can only form a \(1 \times (n+m)\) rectangle (which is essentially the same as the original).
2. **If both dimensions are even**: Cutting an even-by-even rectangle always results in two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
3. **If one dimension is odd and the other is even**: This can also result in a new rectangle being formed.
4. **If both dimensions are odd**: Cutting an odd-by-odd rectangle results in two rectangles that can only form the same original rectangle when rearranged.

### Program Analysis:
Let's look at the provided code and see if it aligns with the above observations:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Condition for Both Dimensions Even**:
   ```python
   if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   This part is correct according to our analysis.

2. **Condition for One Dimension Odd and the Other Even**:
   ```python
   elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
       print('no')
   ```
   This condition is incorrect. It seems to be trying to check if one dimension is twice the other, but the logic is flawed. This condition should actually check if one dimension is odd and the other is even, which would result in a 'yes'.

3. **Condition for Difference in Dimensions**:
   ```python
   elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   This condition is also incorrect. It checks if the difference between dimensions is non-zero, which is not the right way to determine if a new rectangle can be formed.

4. **Default Case**:
   ```python
   else:
       print('no')
   ```
   This default case is incorrect. It should handle the scenario where both dimensions are odd, which should result in a 'no'.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach should be:
- If either dimension is 1, print 'no'.
- If both dimensions are even, print 'yes'.
- If one dimension is odd and the other is even, print 'yes'.
- If both dimensions are odd, print 'no'.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the provided code, it is clear that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

**Correctness: False**
