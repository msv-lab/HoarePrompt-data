Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after making a cut. Let's analyze the code and identify issues:

1. **Logic for Even Dimensions**:
   ```python
   if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   This part seems correct. If both dimensions are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form another rectangle.

2. **Logic for Identical Dimensions**:
   ```python
   elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
       print('no')
   ```
   This condition is incorrect. It seems like an attempt to check if `a` and `b` are equal, but the syntax is wrong and the logic doesn't make sense. The correct condition would be `elif a == b:`.

3. **Logic for Odd Differences**:
   ```python
   elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   This condition is also incorrect. It checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, but the logic is flawed. The correct condition should be checking if the difference is non-zero and one of the dimensions is divisible by 2.

4. **Default Case**:
   ```python
   else:
       print('no')
   ```
   This default case is too broad and doesn't cover all scenarios correctly.

Let's consider a few test cases to demonstrate the issues:

- **Test Case**: `a = 3, b = 2`
  - Expected Output: `Yes`
  - Actual Output: `Yes` (This seems correct based on the current logic, but let's verify further)
  
- **Test Case**: `a = 5, b = 5`
  - Expected Output: `No`
  - Actual Output: `no` (This is correct, but the logic is wrong as explained above)

- **Test Case**: `a = 4, b = 3`
  - Expected Output: `Yes`
  - Actual Output: `yes` (This seems correct based on the current logic, but let's verify further)

- **Test Case**: `a = 7, b = 3`
  - Expected Output: `Yes`
  - Actual Output: `yes` (This seems correct based on the current logic, but let's verify further)

- **Test Case**: `a = 1, b = 1`
  - Expected Output: `No`
  - Actual Output: `no` (This is correct, but the logic is wrong as explained above)

However, the logic for the general case is flawed. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

- If `a == b`, output `No`.
- If either `a` or `b` is even, output `Yes`.
- Otherwise, output `No`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a == b:
            print('no')
        elif a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

# This corrected version should handle all edge cases correctly.
```

Since the original program does not handle all cases correctly, the correctness is **False**.
