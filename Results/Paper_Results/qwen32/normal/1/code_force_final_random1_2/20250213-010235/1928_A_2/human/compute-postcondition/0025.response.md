The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` and `b` are initially defined based on the input, and `i` is incremented by 1. However, the code snippet redefines `a` and `b` with new values read from the input, so the previous values of `a` and `b` are overwritten.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, and `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1.** 

In natural language: The value of `t` remains unchanged. The variables `a` and `b` now hold the new integer values read from the input. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
