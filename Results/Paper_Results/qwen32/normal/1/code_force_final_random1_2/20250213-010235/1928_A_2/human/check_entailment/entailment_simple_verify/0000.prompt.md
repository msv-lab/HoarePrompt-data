You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases and printed 'yes' or 'no' for each pair of integers `(a, b)` based on the given conditions.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after making a cut. Let's analyze the code and identify issues:

1. **Logic for Even Dimensions**:
   ```python
   if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   This part seems correct. If both dimensions are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form another rectangle.

2. **Logic for Identical Dimensions**:
   ```python
   elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
       print('no')
   ```
   This condition is incorrect. It seems like an attempt to check if `a` and `b` are equal, but the syntax is wrong and the logic doesn't make sense. The correct condition would be `elif a == b:`.

3. **Logic for Odd Differences**:
   ```python
   elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   This condition is also incorrect. It checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, but the logic is flawed. The correct condition should be checking if the difference is non-zero and one of the dimensions is divisible by 2.

4. **Default Case**:
   ```python
   else:
       print('no')
   ```
   This default case is too broad and doesn't cover all scenarios correctly.

Let's consider a few test cases to demonstrate the issues:

- **Test Case**: `a = 3, b = 2`
  - Expected Output: `Yes`
  - Actual Output: `Yes` (This seems correct based on the current logic, but let's verify further)
  
- **Test Case**: `a = 5, b = 5`
  - Expected Output: `No`
  - Actual Output: `no` (This is correct, but the logic is wrong as explained above)

- **Test Case**: `a = 4, b = 3`
  - Expected Output: `Yes`
  - Actual Output: `yes` (This seems correct based on the current logic, but let's verify further)

- **Test Case**: `a = 7, b = 3`
  - Expected Output: `Yes`
  - Actual Output: `yes` (This seems correct based on the current logic, but let's verify further)

- **Test Case**: `a = 1, b = 1`
  - Expected Output: `No`
  - Actual Output: `no` (This is correct, but the logic is wrong as explained above)

However, the logic for the general case is flawed. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

- If `a == b`, output `No`.
- If either `a` or `b` is even, output `Yes`.
- Otherwise, output `No`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a == b:
            print('no')
        elif a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

# This corrected version should handle all edge cases correctly.
```

Since the original program does not handle all cases correctly, the correctness is **False**.
