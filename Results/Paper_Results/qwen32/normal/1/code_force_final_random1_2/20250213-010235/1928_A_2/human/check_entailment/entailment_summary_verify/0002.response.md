Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size `a x b` can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then reassembled into a different rectangle. Here are the key points:

1. If both `a` and `b` are even, it's possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and reassemble them into a different rectangle.
2. If either `a` or `b` is odd, the difference between `a` and `b` must be even to form a new rectangle.
3. If `a == b`, no new rectangle can be formed since the only possible cuts would result in squares, which are essentially the same rectangle rotated.

### Program Analysis
Let's examine the given code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`**: This condition is incorrect. It is comparing a tuple with a boolean value, which doesn't make sense. It should check if `a == b` instead.
2. **Condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`**: This condition is always true for any non-zero `a - b`. The correct condition should check if the absolute difference is even, indicating that the smaller rectangles can be rearranged into a new rectangle.
3. **Handling `a == b`**: The code does not correctly handle the case where `a == b`. It should explicitly check for this condition and return 'no' in such cases.

### Corrected Logic:
- If `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`, print 'yes'.
- If `a == b`, print 'no'.
- If `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0` and not both `a` and `b` are odd, print 'yes'.
- Otherwise, print 'no'.

### Revised Code:
Based on the corrected logic, the revised code should look like this:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a == b:
            print('no')
        elif a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment
The original assessment correctly identifies several issues in the provided code:
1. The condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` is incorrect.
2. The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always true for non-zero differences.
3. The case `a == b` is not handled correctly.

However, the original assessment suggests a different set of conditions for the corrected logic, which can be simplified further as shown above.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified and the corrected logic, the original program is indeed incorrect. The original assessment is accurate in identifying these issues.

Final: **False**
