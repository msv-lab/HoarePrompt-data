Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer read from the input, and `b` is the second integer read from the input. At least one of `a` or `b` is odd. Additionally, either `a - b == -a` and `a` is the current value, or `b - a == -b` and `b` is the current value.**
