Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, and `i` is incremented by 1. The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always true since it checks if `a - b` is non-zero, which means `i` is incremented regardless of whether the if or else part is executed.**
