To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and how it affects the output.

Here's the loop again for reference:

```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
        print('yes')
    elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
        print('no')
    elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')
```

### Explanation of the Loop Logic:
1. **Reading Input:** For each iteration, the loop reads two integers `a` and `b`.
2. **Condition Checks:**
   - If both `a` and `b` are even, it prints 'yes'.
   - The condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` seems incorrect due to the tuple syntax, but assuming it was meant to check if `a - b == -a` or `b - a == -b`, which simplifies to checking if `a == 0` or `b == 0`, but given the context, it doesn't seem relevant since `a` and `b` are within 1 to 10^9. Hence, this part can be ignored or considered always false.
   - If the difference `(a - b)` is non-zero (either positive or negative), it prints 'yes'.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'no'.

### Simplified Conditions:
- If both `a` and `b` are even, print 'yes'.
- If `a` and `b` are not both even and their difference is non-zero, print 'yes'.
- If `a` and `b` are equal and both are odd, print 'no'.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the loop will have processed all `t` test cases and printed 'yes' or 'no' for each pair of integers `(a, b)` based on the above logic. The variable `i` will have reached the value `t` (since it increments by 1 in each iteration).

### Conclusion:
The final output state is simply that the loop has processed all `t` test cases and printed the appropriate 'yes' or 'no' for each pair of integers `(a, b)`.

Output State: **The loop has processed all `t` test cases and printed 'yes' or 'no' for each pair of integers `(a, b)` based on the given conditions.**
