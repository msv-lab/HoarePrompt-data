The given code snippet modifies the value of `d2[i]` by setting it to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. This means that the value of `d2[i]` is now one more than the value of `d2[i + 1]`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 2\)
- `i` is \(n - 4\)
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and updated values based on the differences in the list `l`
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 except `d2[n - 1]` which is 1
- `m` is greater than 0
- `j` is `m-1`
- `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input

After executing the line `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]`, the only change is in the value of `d2[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 2\); `i` is \(n - 4\); `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and updated values based on the differences in the list `l`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 except `d2[n - 1]` which is 1 and `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`; `m` is greater than 0; `j` is `m-1`; `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input.**
