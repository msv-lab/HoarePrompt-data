Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 where `d1[2]` and subsequent entries are updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and `d2[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, specifically `d2[n-1]` is 1, and for each `i` from `n-2` down to 1, `d2[i]` is either `1 + d2[i + 1]` or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` depending on the condition, `m` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if y > x:
        print(d1[y] - d1[x])
    else:
        print(d2[y] - d2[x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 where `d1[2]` and subsequent entries are updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and `d2[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, specifically `d2[n-1]` is 1, and for each `i` from `n-2` down to 1, `d2[i]` is either `1 + d2[i + 1]` or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` depending on the condition, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer. If `y` is greater than `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 where `d1[2]` and subsequent entries are updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and `d2[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, specifically `d2[n-1]` is 1, and for each `i` from `n-2` down to 1, `d2[i]` is either `1 + d2[i + 1]` or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` depending on the condition, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input, and `j` is 1. The state of the variables remains unchanged regardless of whether `y > x` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 where `d1[2]` and subsequent entries are updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and `d2[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, specifically `d2[n-1]` is 1, and for each `i` from `n-2` down to 1, `d2[i]` is either `1 + d2[i + 1]` or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` depending on the condition, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input, and `j` is 2. The state of the variables remains unchanged regardless of whether `y > x` or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
