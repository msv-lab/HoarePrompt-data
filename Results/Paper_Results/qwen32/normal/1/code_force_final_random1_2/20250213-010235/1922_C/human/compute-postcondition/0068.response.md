To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state was:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 1
- `n` is at least 2
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and it has specific entries based on the condition
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 (and no specific entries)
- `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0
- `j` is `m-1`
- `x` and `y` are input values for each iteration

Since the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-2`, we need to increment `i` by 1 to get the state at the start of the next iteration.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

- `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.
- `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

No other variables in the loop head (`n`) need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 (and no specific entries), `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, and no further changes to `x` and `y` as they are input values for each iteration**.
