You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

It has also processed all `m` queries for each test case, printing the appropriate distance difference for each query pair `(x, y)`. The variables `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, `j`, `x`, and `y` reflect the state after processing the last test case and its queries.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of city coordinates and a series of queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the distance difference based on predefined rules involving the closest cities relative to the midpoint between the queried cities.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities based on the problem description. Specifically, the logic for calculating the cost using dictionaries `d1` and `d2` is flawed. The dictionaries are supposed to store the cumulative cost to reach each city from the start or end, but they are incorrectly updated and used.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initialization and Update Logic**:
   - `d1` is supposed to store the cumulative cost to reach each city from the start. However, the initialization `d1[2] = 1` is incorrect because it assumes the cost to reach the second city from the first is always 1, which is not true.
   - Similarly, `d2` is supposed to store the cumulative cost to reach each city from the end, but `d2[n - 1] = 1` is incorrect for the same reason.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation inside the loops is incorrect. For example, `d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]` assumes that the cost to move to the next city is always 1 if the next city is closer, which is not the case. The cost should be the actual distance if the next city is not the closest.
   - The same issue applies to `d2`.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - When handling queries, the program uses the cumulative costs stored in `d1` and `d2`. However, these cumulative costs are not correctly computed, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the program, we need to correctly compute the closest city for each city and then use dynamic programming or another approach to compute the minimum cost to travel between any two cities.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Determine the closest city for each city
        closest_left = [-1] * n
        closest_right = [-1] * n
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if i == 1 or l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i] - l[closest_left[i - 1]]:
                closest_left[i] = i - 1
            else:
                closest_left[i] = closest_left[i - 1]
        
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if i == n - 2 or l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[closest_right[i + 1]]:
                closest_right[i] = i + 1
            else:
                closest_right[i] = closest_right[i + 1]
        
        # Precompute the minimum cost to travel between any two cities
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        for i in range(n):
            j = closest_right[i]
            while j != -1:
                dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i][closest_right[j]]
                j = closest_right[j]
            
            j = closest_left[i]
            while j != -1:
                dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i][closest_left[j]]
                j = closest_left[j]
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], abs(l[j] - l[i]))
                dp[j][i] = dp[i][j]
        
        m = int(input())
        for _ in range(m):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            print(dp[x - 1][y - 1])

func()
```

This corrected version properly determines the closest city for each city and precomputes the minimum cost to travel between any two cities, ensuring that the solution works correctly for all possible inputs.
