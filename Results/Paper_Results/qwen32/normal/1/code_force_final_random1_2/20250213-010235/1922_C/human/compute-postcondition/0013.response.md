The code snippet updates the value of `d1` at the key `i + 2`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the key `i + 2` evaluates to 3. The new value for `d1[3]` is set to `1 + d1[2]`. Since `d1` is a defaultdict with a default integer value of 0, `d1[2]` is initially 0. Therefore, `d1[3]` is set to `1 + 0`, which is 1.

The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, and `d2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 except `d1[3]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0**.
