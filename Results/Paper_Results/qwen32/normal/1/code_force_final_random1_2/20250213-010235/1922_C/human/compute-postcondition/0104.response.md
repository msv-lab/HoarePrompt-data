To determine what will be printed by the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i`: Initialized to 0.
- `n`: Greater than 2.
- `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
- `d1`: A `defaultdict` with keys from 2 to `n` updated based on conditions in the loop.
- `d2`: A `defaultdict` with a default integer value of 0, and values from `d2[1]` to `d2[n - 1]` updated based on conditions in the loop.
- `m`: Greater than 0.
- `j`: Initialized to `m`.
- `x` and `y`: Two new integers read from the input. It is given that `y > x`.

### Key Points:

- `d2` is a dictionary where the keys range from 1 to `n - 1`, and the values are integers (initialized to 0 by default).
- The values in `d2` are updated based on some conditions inside a loop, but the specific updates are not detailed here.
- The print statement computes the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x`.

### Calculation of the Output:

Given the initial state, the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement will output the difference between the values stored in `d2` at keys `y` and `x`.

Since the exact values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are not provided, we can only express the output in terms of these values.

### Final Output:

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] and d2[x] are the values in the defaultdict d2 at keys y and x respectively)**
