Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `m`, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 (and no specific values from `d2[1]` to `d2[previous `n` - 1]` as they are reset), `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input.**

In natural language: The value of `d1[2]` has been updated to 1. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
