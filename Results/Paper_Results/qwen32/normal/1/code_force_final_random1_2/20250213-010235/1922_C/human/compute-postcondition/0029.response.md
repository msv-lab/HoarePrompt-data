The code snippet provided updates the value of `d2[i]`. According to the code, `d2[i]` is set to `1 + d2[i + 1]`.

Given the initial state, `d2[i]` could have been either `2` (if `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`) or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` (otherwise). However, after executing the provided line of code, `d2[i]` is explicitly set to `1 + d2[i + 1]`.

Therefore, the only change is in the value of `d2[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is n - 3, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 where `d1[2]` and subsequent entries are updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is 1. `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`.**
