Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each query, x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Additionally, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    d1 = defaultdict(int)
    d2 = defaultdict(int)
    d1[2] = 1
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
            d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
        else:
            d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]
    d2[n - 1] = 1
    for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
        if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]:
            d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]
        else:
            d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]
    m = int(input())
    for j in range(m):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        if y > x:
            print(d1[y] - d1[x])
        else:
            print(d2[y] - d2[x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 where `d1[2]` and subsequent entries are updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and `d2[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, specifically `d2[n-1]` is 1, and for each `i` from `n-2` down to 1, `d2[i]` is either `1 + d2[i + 1]` or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` depending on the condition, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, and no further changes to `x` and `y` as they are input values for each iteration.`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 2 to `n` updated based on the conditions in the loop, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and values from `d2[1]` to `d2[n - 1]` updated based on the conditions in the loop, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input. The loop has completed all `m` iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 2\), `i` is 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and updated values based on the differences in the list `l`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 except `d2[n - 1]` which is 1 and other values calculated according to the loop logic, `m` is an integer input from the user such that \(m \geq 1\), `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input. If `y` is greater than `x`, then `y` is indeed greater than `x`. Otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`. The loop has executed `m` times.`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
