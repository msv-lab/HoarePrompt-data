The code updates the value in the `d1` dictionary at the key `i + 2` to be one more than the value at the key `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 2, this means `d1[4]` is set to `1 + d1[3]`.

Since no other variables are modified, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[4]` is `1 + d1[3]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0**.
