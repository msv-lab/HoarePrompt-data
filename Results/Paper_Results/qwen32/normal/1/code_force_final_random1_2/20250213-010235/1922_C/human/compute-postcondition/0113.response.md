The given code snippet reads a new value for `n` from the input, which means the previous value of `n` is replaced by this new value. All other variables retain their previous values unless they are directly affected by the new value of `n`. Since no other variables are modified in the provided code snippet, only `n` changes.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `m`, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 2 to the previous `n` updated based on the conditions in the loop, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and values from `d2[1]` to `d2[previous `n` - 1]` updated based on the conditions in the loop, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input. The loop has completed all `m` iterations.**
