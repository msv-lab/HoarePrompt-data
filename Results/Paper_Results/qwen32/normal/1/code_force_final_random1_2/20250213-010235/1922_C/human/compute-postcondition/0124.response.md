The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `m`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be within the range `[1, n-1)`.

So, `i` should be `m + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Since `m` is greater than 0 and `n` is greater than 2, `i` being `m + 1` will still satisfy the condition `1 <= i < n - 1` as long as `m + 1 < n - 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `m + 1`, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input.**
