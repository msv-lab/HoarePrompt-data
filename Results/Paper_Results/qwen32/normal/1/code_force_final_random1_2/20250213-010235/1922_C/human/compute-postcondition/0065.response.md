Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and an entry `{2: 1}`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 (and no specific entries), `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, and no further changes to `x` and `y` as they are input values for each iteration. Additionally, `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is greater than or equal to `l[i] - l[i - 1]`.**
