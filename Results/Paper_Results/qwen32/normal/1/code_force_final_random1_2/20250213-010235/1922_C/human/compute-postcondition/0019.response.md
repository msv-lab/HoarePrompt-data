Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0. If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[4]` is `1 + d1[3]`. Otherwise, `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`.**
