To determine what will be printed by the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

### Initial State Breakdown
1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i`: Initialized to 0.
   - `n`: Greater than 2.
   - `l`: A list of integers.
   - `d1`: A `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0. Entries starting from `d1[2]` are updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`.
   - `d2`: Another `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0. Specifically:
     - `d2[n-1]` is set to 1.
     - For each `i` from `n-2` down to 1, `d2[i]` is calculated as either `1 + d2[i + 1]` or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` depending on the condition.
   - `m`: An input integer that must be greater than 0.
   - `x` and `y`: Two integers read from the input.
   - `j`: Initialized to 2.

### Calculation of `d2`
The `d2` dictionary is constructed in a specific manner:
- `d2[n-1]` is set to 1.
- For each `i` from `n-2` down to 1, the value of `d2[i]` is determined by the following logic:
  - If a certain condition holds, `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]`.
  - Otherwise, `d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.

### The Print Statement
The statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` will output the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x`.

### Explanation of the Output
Given the construction of `d2`, the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` depend on the specific values in the list `l` and the conditions used to update `d2`. Since the exact list `l` and the conditions are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these values.

### Final Output
The print statement will output the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] and d2[x] are values determined by the updates based on the list l and the conditions specified)**
