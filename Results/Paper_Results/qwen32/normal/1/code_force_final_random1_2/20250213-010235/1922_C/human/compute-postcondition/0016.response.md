The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and the list `l`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 2
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0
- The condition `if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` determines whether `d1[3]` is set to 1 or `d1[i + 2]` is updated.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (as per the `range(1, n - 1)`). Thus, `i` should now be 2.

Since `n` is greater than 2, it remains unchanged as it is a boundary condition for the loop.

The list `l` does not need to be modified because it is used for comparison and indexing within the loop body, but its values are not altered by the loop header itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0**.
