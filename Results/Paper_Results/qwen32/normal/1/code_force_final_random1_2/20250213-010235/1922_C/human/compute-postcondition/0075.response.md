Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 4, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[4]` is set to 1 if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, otherwise `d1[4]` is set to `l[3] - l[2]`. Additionally, `d1[5]` is set to `1 + d1[4]` if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, otherwise `d1[5]` is set to `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`. `d2` remains a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no specific entries. `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, and no further changes are made to `x` and `y` as they are input values for each iteration.**
