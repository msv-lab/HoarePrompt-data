Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 (and no specific entries), `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, and no further changes to `x` and `y` as they are input values for each iteration. If the difference between `l[i+1]` and `l[i]` is less than the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i-1]`, then `d1` has entries `{2: 1, 3: 2}`. Otherwise, `d1` has entries `{2: 1, 3: l[2] - l[1] + 1}`.**
