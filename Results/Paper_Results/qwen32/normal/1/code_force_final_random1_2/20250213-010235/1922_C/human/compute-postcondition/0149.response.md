The code snippet provided is:

```python
m = int(input())
```

This line of code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `m`. The new value of `m` is the integer input by the user. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `j`, `x`, and `y` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 2\); `i` is `0`; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and updated values based on the differences in the list `l`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 except `d2[n - 1]` which is 1 and other values calculated according to the loop logic; `m` is the integer input from the user; `j` is `m-1`; `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input.**
