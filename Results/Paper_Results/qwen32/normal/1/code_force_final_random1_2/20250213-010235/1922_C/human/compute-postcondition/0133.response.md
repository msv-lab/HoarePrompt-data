The code snippet `d2[n - 1] = 1` updates the defaultdict `d2` by setting the value associated with the key `n - 1` to 1. This means that the value of `d2` at the index `n - 1` is now 1, while all other values in `d2` remain unchanged.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` remains `n - 1`.
- `n` remains the new input integer.
- `l` remains the new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `d1` remains a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and updated values based on the differences in the list `l`.
- `d2` now has its value at the key `n - 1` set to 1.
- `m` remains greater than 0.
- `j` remains `m-1`.
- `x` and `y` remain the last pair of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and updated values based on the differences in the list `l`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 except `d2[n - 1]` which is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input.**
