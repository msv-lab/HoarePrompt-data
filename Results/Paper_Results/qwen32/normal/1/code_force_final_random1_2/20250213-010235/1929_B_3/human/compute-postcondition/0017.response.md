Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 999; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. The condition `4 * n - 2 == k` is evaluated. If the condition is true, then the condition remains true. If the condition is false, then the condition remains false.**

This postcondition summarizes that after executing the if-else block, the variable `t` still satisfies the condition 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 999, and the relationship between `n` and `k` (whether `4 * n - 2 == k` holds true or false) remains unchanged as it was before the execution of the if-else block.
