To determine what will be printed by the `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\). This variable does not directly affect the calculation of `ceil(k / 2)`, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
   - There is a condition: if \(4 \cdot n - 2 = k\), then the condition is true; otherwise, it is false. This condition does not directly affect the calculation of `ceil(k / 2)` either, but it provides a relationship between `n` and `k`.

2. **Expression Analysis:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `ceil(k / 2)`.
   - `ceil(x)` is a function that returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x`.
   - Therefore, `ceil(k / 2)` will return the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(k / 2\).

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - Since `k` is an integer, \(k / 2\) could be an integer or a half-integer (e.g., 3.5).
   - If `k` is even, \(k / 2\) is an integer, and `ceil(k / 2)` will simply be \(k / 2\).
   - If `k` is odd, \(k / 2\) is a half-integer, and `ceil(k / 2)` will be the next integer above \(k / 2\).

Given these points, the output of the print statement depends on the value of `k`. Here's how we can describe it precisely:

- If `k` is even, `ceil(k / 2)` will be `k / 2`.
- If `k` is odd, `ceil(k / 2)` will be `(k + 1) / 2`.

However, since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where ceil(k / 2) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k / 2)**
