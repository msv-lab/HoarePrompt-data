The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 999; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. The condition `4 * n - 2 == k` is evaluated. If the condition is true, then the condition remains true. If the condition is false, then the condition remains false.**
