Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, for each test case, if the conditions on `n` and `k` are met (with `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2`), the function computes and returns a specific value or result.**
