Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999. However, `t` does not directly influence the output of the print statement.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- There is a condition: If `4 * n - 2` equals `k`, then the condition is true; otherwise, the condition is false. This condition affects the relationship between `n` and `k` but does not directly affect the output of the print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The expression `k // 2 + 1` involves integer division (`//`) and addition.
- `k // 2` performs integer division of `k` by 2, which means it divides `k` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
- Adding 1 to the result of `k // 2` shifts the result up by one.

### Output:
The output will be the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`. Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified, we cannot compute a specific numerical value. However, we can describe the output precisely in terms of `k`.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is an integer read from the input)**
