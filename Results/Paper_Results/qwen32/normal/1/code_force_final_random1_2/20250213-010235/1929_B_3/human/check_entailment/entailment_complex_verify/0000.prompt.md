You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))



- Annotated Code: 
from math import ceil

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and k where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, printing `t` values based on the condition `4 * n - 2 == k`. Each value is either `k // 2 + 1` if the condition is true, or `ceil(k / 2)` if the condition is false.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on whether `k` equals `4 * n - 2`. If `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, it prints `k // 2 + 1`; otherwise, it prints the ceiling of `k / 2`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.
- For each test case, we need to output the minimum number of cells that need to be colored.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases \( t \). For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and then computes the minimum number of cells to color using the following logic:
- If \( 4n - 2 = k \), it prints \( k // 2 + 1 \).
- Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify if this logic holds for different scenarios.

#### Case 1: \( 4n - 2 = k \)
If \( k = 4n - 2 \), it means we need to color cells in all diagonals. The formula \( k // 2 + 1 \) does not seem correct here. For example, if \( n = 3 \), then \( 4n - 2 = 10 \). According to the problem, we need to color cells in all 10 diagonals. However, the formula gives \( 10 // 2 + 1 = 6 \), which is incorrect. The correct answer should be \( n \), which is 3 in this case because we can color the main diagonal and anti-diagonal to cover all 10 diagonals.

#### Case 2: \( 4n - 2 > k \)
For \( k < 4n - 2 \), the formula \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) seems more plausible. However, we need to ensure it works for all values of \( k \).

### Testing Specific Cases:
Let's test some specific cases manually:

1. **Case 1: \( n = 3, k = 4 \)**
   - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
   - Expected minimum cells: 2 (coloring the main diagonal and one cell in the anti-diagonal)
   - Program output: \( \lceil 4 / 2 \rceil = 2 \) (correct)

2. **Case 2: \( n = 3, k = 3 \)**
   - Total diagonals: 10
   - Expected minimum cells: 2 (coloring the main diagonal and one cell in the anti-diagonal)
   - Program output: \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \) (correct)

3. **Case 3: \( n = 3, k = 10 \)**
   - Total diagonals: 10
   - Expected minimum cells: 3 (coloring the main diagonal and anti-diagonal)
   - Program output: \( k // 2 + 1 = 10 // 2 + 1 = 6 \) (incorrect, should be 3)

4. **Case 4: \( n = 3, k = 9 \)**
   - Total diagonals: 10
   - Expected minimum cells: 3 (coloring the main diagonal and anti-diagonal)
   - Program output: \( k // 2 + 1 = 9 // 2 + 1 = 5 \) (incorrect, should be 3)

5. **Case 5: \( n = 4, k = 7 \)**
   - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 4 - 2 = 14 \)
   - Expected minimum cells: 4 (coloring the main diagonal and anti-diagonal)
   - Program output: \( \lceil 7 / 2 \rceil = 4 \) (correct)

6. **Case 6: \( n = 7, k = 11 \)**
   - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 7 - 2 = 26 \)
   - Expected minimum cells: 6 (coloring the main diagonal and anti-diagonal)
   - Program output: \( \lceil 11 / 2 \rceil = 6 \) (correct)

7. **Case 7: \( n = 2, k = 3 \)**
   - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 2 - 2 = 6 \)
   - Expected minimum cells: 2 (coloring the main diagonal and anti-diagonal)
   - Program output: \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \) (correct)

From these cases, it is clear that the program fails for cases where \( k = 4n - 2 \). Specifically, the formula \( k // 2 + 1 \) does not yield the correct result in these scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where \( k = 4n - 2 \) correctly. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
