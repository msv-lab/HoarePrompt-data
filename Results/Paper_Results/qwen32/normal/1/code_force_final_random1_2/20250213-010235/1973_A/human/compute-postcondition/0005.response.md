The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables in the given context. It is typically used within loops to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop structure provided in the code snippet, the `continue` statement here has no effect on the variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, `resultats` is a list containing the single element `-1`, `total_points` is `p_1 + p_2 + p_3` from the first tuple in `cas_de_test`. The current value of `total_points` is odd.**
