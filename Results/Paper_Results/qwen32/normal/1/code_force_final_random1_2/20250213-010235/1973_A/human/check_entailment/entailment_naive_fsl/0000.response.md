Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness according to the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` such that `p1 <= p2 <= p3`. The total points from all games must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (if there's a winner and a loser) or 2 points (if it's a draw).

### Provided Program Analysis

Here's the provided program:

```python
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats
```

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Test Case in Input**:
   - The test case `(0, 2, 3)` is invalid because `p2` should always be greater than or equal to `p1` and `p3` should always be greater than or equal to `p2`. Hence, this test case should be `(0, 0, 3)` or `(0, 2, 2)` or something similar to be valid.
   
2. **Logic Errors**:
   - The condition `total_matchs > 3` is incorrect. The maximum number of matches is not limited to 3. For example, if `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 0`, and `p3 = 6`, the maximum number of matches is 6.
   - The calculation of `egalites` seems incorrect. The formula used doesn't accurately reflect the maximum number of draws possible.

### Correctness Check

Given these issues, let's verify if the program works correctly for valid test cases:

- **Test Case (0, 0, 0)**: Correct, no games played, so 0 draws.
- **Test Case (0, 1, 1)**: Correct, one draw between the second and third player.
- **Test Case (1, 1, 2)**: Correct, two draws.
- **Test Case (3, 3, 3)**: Incorrect, the program returns `-1` but it's possible to have 3 draws.
- **Test Case (3, 4, 5)**: Incorrect, the program returns `6` which is not possible.
- **Test Case (1, 1, 10)**: Incorrect, the program returns `2` which is not possible.
- **Test Case (0, 0, 6)**: Incorrect, the program returns `-1` but it's possible to have 6 draws.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program does not handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly handles several test cases and has logical errors in calculating the maximum number of draws.
