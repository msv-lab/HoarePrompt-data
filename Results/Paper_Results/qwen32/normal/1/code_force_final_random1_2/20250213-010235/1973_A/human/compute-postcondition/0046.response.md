Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `cas_de_test`, a list of `t` tuples. Each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players for a single test case (where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30). The function returns a list `resultats` containing integers derived from evaluating each tuple in `cas_de_test` according to specified rules.**
