The only variables in the loop head are `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, which come from the tuples in the `cas_de_test` list. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to reflect the next tuple in the list.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `(p1, p2, p3)` is the next tuple in `cas_de_test`. This means that for the next iteration, we should take the next tuple from `cas_de_test`.

Since the problem specifies that `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple (excluding the one just processed), we can assume that there is indeed another tuple available.

Let's denote the next tuple in `cas_de_test` as `(p1_next, p2_next, p3_next)`. The state needs to be updated to reflect this new tuple.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple (excluding the one just processed). `(p1, p2, p3)` is the next tuple in `cas_de_test`, which is `(p1_next, p2_next, p3_next)`. `total_points` is equal to `p1_next + p2_next + p3_next`, and `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3_next - p2_next) - 2 * (p3_next - p1_next)`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` now includes `-1` as its last element. `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`. If `total_matchs > 3` or `p3_next > total_matchs`, the conditions remain as specified. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` includes `-1` as its last element. Otherwise, `resultats` includes `egalites // 2` as its last element.**

In simpler terms, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple (excluding the one just processed). `(p1, p2, p3)` is the next tuple in `cas_de_test`.**
