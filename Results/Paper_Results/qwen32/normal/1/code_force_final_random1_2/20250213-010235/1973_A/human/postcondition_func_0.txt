The function takes an integer `t` and a list of tuples `cas_de_test`. Each tuple contains three integers representing scores of three players. It evaluates each tuple based on specific rules and returns a list of integers, where each integer corresponds to the result of evaluating one tuple. If the conditions are not met for a tuple, it appends `-1` to the result list; otherwise, it calculates and appends the number of equal matches.
