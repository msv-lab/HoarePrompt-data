The code initializes an empty list named `resultats`. No changes are made to the variables `t` or `cas_de_test`. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the new variable `resultats`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30; `resultats` is an empty list.**
