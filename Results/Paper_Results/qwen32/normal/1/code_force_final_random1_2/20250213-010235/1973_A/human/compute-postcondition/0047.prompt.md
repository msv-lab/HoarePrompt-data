You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and cas_de_test is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. Each tuple represents the scores of the three players for a single test case.
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
        
    #State: `resultats` is a list of integers derived from evaluating each tuple in `cas_de_test` according to the specified rules.
    return resultats
    #The program returns the list `resultats` which contains integers derived from evaluating each tuple in `cas_de_test` according to the specified rules.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `cas_de_test`, a list of `t` tuples. Each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players for a single test case (where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30). The function returns a list `resultats` containing integers derived from evaluating each tuple in `cas_de_test` according to specified rules.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `resultats` which contains integers derived from evaluating each tuple in `cas_de_test` according to the specified rules.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
