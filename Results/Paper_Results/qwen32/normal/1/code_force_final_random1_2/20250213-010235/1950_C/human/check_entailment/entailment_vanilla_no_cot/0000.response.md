Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The function `func_1()` is defined but never called, so the code inside it will not execute.
2. The logic for converting hours from 24-hour format to 12-hour format is incorrect. Specifically, the handling of the hour '12' and the conversion of hours greater than 12 is flawed.
3. The formatting of the hour in the output is incorrect. For example, when converting hours greater than 12, the code attempts to prepend a '0' to the hour, which can result in incorrect formatting (e.g., '013' instead of '01').

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input().strip()
        h, m = s.split(':')
        h = int(h)
        
        if h == 0:
            h_12 = 12
            period = 'AM'
        elif h < 12:
            h_12 = h
            period = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            h_12 = 12
            period = 'PM'
        else:
            h_12 = h - 12
            period = 'PM'
        
        print(f"{h_12:02}:{m} {period}")

func_1()
```

In this corrected version:
- The function `func_1()` is called at the end to ensure the code executes.
- The logic correctly handles the conversion of hours from 24-hour to 12-hour format.
- The `f-string` formatting ensures that the hour is always printed with two digits, preserving leading zeros where necessary.
