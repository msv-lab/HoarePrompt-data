Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts. There are two pricing options:
- Buy one yogurt for `a` burles.
- Buy two yogurts for `b` burles (promotion).

The goal is to find the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

### Logic to Solve the Problem:
1. **If the regular price for two yogurts (`2 * a`) is less than the promotional price (`b`)**, then it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually. Therefore, the total cost would be `n * a`.
2. **Otherwise**, we should consider using the promotion as much as possible:
   - If `n` is even, then all yogurts can be bought in pairs, and the total cost would be `(n / 2) * b`.
   - If `n` is odd, then `(n - 1)` yogurts can be bought in pairs, and the remaining one yogurt can be bought individually. The total cost would be `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

- **First Condition (`if B * 2 < C`)**:
  - This checks if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion. If true, it prints `A * B` (which should be `n * a`).
  
- **Second Condition (`elif A % 2 == 0`)**:
  - This checks if `n` (stored as `A` in the code) is even. If true, it prints `int(A * C / 2)` (which should be `(n / 2) * b`).
  
- **Else Block**:
  - If `n` is odd, it calculates the cost as `X * C + B`, where `X` is `A // 2`. This means it buys `(n - 1)` yogurts in pairs and one yogurt individually. The cost calculation here is correct as well.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the program is correct. It handles both scenarios (even and odd `n`) and considers whether the promotion is beneficial.

**Correctness:** **True**
