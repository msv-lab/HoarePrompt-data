You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.

        elif A % 2 == 0:

        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price of two yogurts under promotion is `b` burles.
- Determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost based on the following logic:
1. If the cost of two yogurts (`b`) is less than twice the cost of one yogurt (`2*a`), it would be cheaper to buy yogurts individually. Therefore, the total cost is `n * a`.
2. If `n` is even, the optimal strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs, so the total cost is `(n/2) * b`.
3. If `n` is odd, the optimal strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible and one yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `(n//2) * b + a`.

### Edge Cases:
- When `n` is 1, the program should simply return `a` because buying one yogurt individually is the only option.
- When `b >= 2*a`, the program should always buy yogurts individually.
- When `b < 2*a`, the program should buy as many pairs as possible and handle the remaining yogurt(s) appropriately.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider the provided examples and some additional edge cases:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Output: `9` (buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price)
   - Expected: `9`
   
2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Output: `14` (buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price and 1 yogurt individually)
   - Expected: `14`
   
3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Output: `15` (buy 3 yogurts individually)
   - Expected: `15`
   
4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Output: `20` (buy 4 yogurts individually)
   - Expected: `20`

5. **Additional Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 5 9`
   - Output: `5` (buy 1 yogurt individually)
   - Expected: `5`
   
6. **Additional Case 2:**
   - Input: `5 5 8`
   - Output: `20` (buy 2 pairs and 1 yogurt individually)
   - Expected: `20`
   
7. **Additional Case 3:**
   - Input: `6 5 8`
   - Output: `24` (buy 3 pairs)
   - Expected: `24`

### Conclusion:
The program handles the provided examples and additional edge cases correctly. It considers both scenarios where buying in pairs is beneficial and where buying individually is necessary. There are no apparent issues with the logic or implementation.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts by considering whether it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually or in pairs, and it handles both even and odd values of `n` appropriately.
