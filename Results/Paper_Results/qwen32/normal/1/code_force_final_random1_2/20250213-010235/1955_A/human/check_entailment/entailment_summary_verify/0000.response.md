Let's carefully analyze the program and its logic to ensure it aligns with the problem description and the provided function summary.

### Problem Recap:
- Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price of two yogurts under promotion is `b` burles.
- Determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and calculates the minimum cost based on the following logic:
1. If the cost of two yogurts (`b`) is less than twice the cost of one yogurt (`2*a`), it would be cheaper to buy yogurts individually. Therefore, the total cost is `n * a`.
2. If `n` is even, the optimal strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs, so the total cost is `(n/2) * b`.
3. If `n` is odd, the optimal strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible and one yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `(n//2) * b + a`.

### Issues in the Program:
Upon closer inspection, we notice that the condition `if B * 2 < C` is incorrect. The condition should actually check if `b` (the promotion price for two yogurts) is greater than or equal to `2*a` (the price for two yogurts bought individually). If `b` is greater than or equal to `2*a`, it would be cheaper to buy yogurts individually.

Here's the corrected condition:
- If `b >= 2*a`, then it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually, so the total cost is `n * a`.
- Otherwise, if `n` is even, the optimal strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs, so the total cost is `(n/2) * b`.
- If `n` is odd, the optimal strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible and one yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `(n//2) * b + a`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b >= 2 * a:
            print(n * a)
        elif n % 2 == 0:
            print((n // 2) * b)
        else:
            X = n // 2
            print(X * b + a)
```

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the corrected program with the provided examples and additional edge cases:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Output: `9` (buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price)
   - Expected: `9`
   
2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Output: `14` (buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price and 1 yogurt individually)
   - Expected: `14`
   
3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Output: `15` (buy 3 yogurts individually)
   - Expected: `15`
   
4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Output: `20` (buy 4 yogurts individually)
   - Expected: `20`

5. **Additional Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 5 9`
   - Output: `5` (buy 1 yogurt individually)
   - Expected: `5`
   
6. **Additional Case 2:**
   - Input: `5 5 8`
   - Output: `20` (buy 2 pairs and 1 yogurt individually)
   - Expected: `20`
   
7. **Additional Case 3:**
   - Input: `6 5 8`
   - Output: `24` (buy 3 pairs)
   - Expected: `24`

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error in the condition checking whether to buy yogurts individually or in pairs. The corrected program handles all the provided examples and additional edge cases correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The original program incorrectly checks the condition `if B * 2 < C`. It should check `if b >= 2 * a` to determine whether it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually or in pairs.

Final: **False**
