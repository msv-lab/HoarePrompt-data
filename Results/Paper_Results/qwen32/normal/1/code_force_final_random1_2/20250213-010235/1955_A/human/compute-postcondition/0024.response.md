Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are the positive integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1; `X` is `A // 2`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `X` is now set to the integer division of `A` by 2. The values of `A`, `B`, `C`, and the fact that `i` is incremented by 1 remain unchanged.
