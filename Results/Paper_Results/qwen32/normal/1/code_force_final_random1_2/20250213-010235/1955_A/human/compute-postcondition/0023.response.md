Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- **Initial State:**
  - `A`, `B`, and `C` are positive integers read from the input.
  - `i` is incremented by 1. However, the variable `i` is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.

- **Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  print(int(A * C / 2))
  ```

### Explanation:
- The expression inside the `print` statement is `int(A * C / 2)`.
- Here, `A` and `C` are positive integers.
- The expression `A * C` multiplies these two integers.
- The result of `A * C` is then divided by 2.
- The `int()` function converts the result of the division into an integer, effectively performing integer division (which discards any fractional part).

### Output:
Given the initial state, the output will be the integer result of the expression `int(A * C / 2)`. Since the exact values of `A` and `C` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A and C are positive integers read from the input)**
