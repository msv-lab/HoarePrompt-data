You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())

            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: The loop has processed `n` sets of `(A, B, C)` and printed the corresponding results based on the conditions provided. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
- **Objective:** Determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts.
- **Prices:**
  - Single yogurt costs `a` burles.
  - Two yogurts together cost `b` burles.
- **Approach:**
  - If buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`) is cheaper than the promotion (`b`), then buy all yogurts individually.
  - Otherwise, buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible using the promotion.
  - If there is an odd number of yogurts, buy the remaining one individually.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the code logic:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

1. **Loop through Test Cases:**
   - The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

2. **Read Input Values:**
   - For each test case, read `A` (number of yogurts), `B` (price of one yogurt), and `C` (price of two yogurts).

3. **Determine Minimum Cost:**
   - **Condition 1:** If `2 * B < C`, it means buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion. Therefore, the total cost is `A * B`.
   - **Condition 2:** If `A` is even, the best strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs, so the total cost is `(A * C) / 2`.
   - **Condition 3:** If `A` is odd, buy as many pairs as possible (`A // 2` pairs) and pay `C` for each pair. Then, buy the remaining yogurt individually at price `B`. Thus, the total cost is `(A // 2) * C + B`.

### Verification Against Example:
Let's verify the code against the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1:** `2 5 9`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`, so buy 2 yogurts with the promotion.
   - Cost: `9`.

2. **Test Case 2:** `3 5 9`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`, so buy 2 yogurts with the promotion and 1 yogurt individually.
   - Cost: `9 + 5 = 14`.

3. **Test Case 3:** `3 5 11`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`, so buy all 3 yogurts individually.
   - Cost: `3 * 5 = 15`.

4. **Test Case 4:** `4 5 11`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`, so buy all 4 yogurts individually.
   - Cost: `4 * 5 = 20`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices and conditions.

**Correctness:** **True**
