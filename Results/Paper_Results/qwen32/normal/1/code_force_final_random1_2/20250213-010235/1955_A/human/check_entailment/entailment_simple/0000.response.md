### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program to determine if it correctly computes the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `A` (number of yogurts), `B` (price of one yogurt), and `C` (price of two yogurts with promotion).

2. **Logic to Determine Minimum Cost:**
   - **Condition 1:** If the cost of buying two yogurts individually (`B * 2`) is less than the promotional price (`C`), it means buying them individually is cheaper. Therefore, the total cost is simply `A * B`.
   - **Condition 2:** If `A` (the number of yogurts) is even, the most cost-effective way is to buy all yogurts in pairs using the promotion. Thus, the total cost is `(A * C) / 2`.
   - **Condition 3:** If `A` is odd, the program calculates the cost for the maximum possible pairs (`X = A // 2`), and then adds the cost of one additional yogurt (`B`). This is done by calculating `X * C + B`.

3. **Verification Against Example:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `n=2, a=5, b=9`
     - Since `2*5 < 9`, the cost is `2*5 = 10`. However, since buying two yogurts in a pair is cheaper (`9`), the output is `9`.
   - **Test Case 2:** `n=3, a=5, b=9`
     - Here, `3*5 = 15` and `2*9 + 5 = 23`. The best option is to buy two yogurts in a pair and one individually, so the cost is `9 + 5 = 14`.
   - **Test Case 3:** `n=3, a=5, b=11`
     - Here, `3*5 = 15` and `2*11 + 5 = 27`. The best option is to buy all three yogurts individually, so the cost is `15`.
   - **Test Case 4:** `n=4, a=5, b=11`
     - Here, `4*5 = 20` and `2*11 = 22`. The best option is to buy all yogurts in pairs, so the cost is `22`.

The program seems to correctly handle these scenarios and aligns with the expected outputs.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
