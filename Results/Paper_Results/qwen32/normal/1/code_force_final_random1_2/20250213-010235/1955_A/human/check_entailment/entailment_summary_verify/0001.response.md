Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment based on the problem description and function summary.

### Problem Breakdown:
- **Objective:** Determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts.
- **Prices:**
  - Single yogurt costs `a` burles.
  - Two yogurts together cost `b` burles.

### Program Analysis:
The provided code is as follows:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Loop through Test Cases:**
   - The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

2. **Read Input Values:**
   - For each test case, read `A` (number of yogurts), `B` (price of one yogurt), and `C` (price of two yogurts).

3. **Determine Minimum Cost:**
   - **Condition 1:** If `2 * B < C`, it means buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion. Therefore, the total cost is `A * B`.
   - **Condition 2:** If `A` is even, the best strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs, so the total cost is `(A * C) / 2`.
   - **Condition 3:** If `A` is odd, buy as many pairs as possible (`A // 2` pairs) and pay `C` for each pair. Then, buy the remaining yogurt individually at price `B`. Thus, the total cost is `(A // 2) * C + B`.

### Verification Against Example:
Let's verify the code against the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1:** `2 5 9`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`, so buy 2 yogurts with the promotion.
   - Cost: `9`.

2. **Test Case 2:** `3 5 9`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`, so buy 2 yogurts with the promotion and 1 yogurt individually.
   - Cost: `9 + 5 = 14`.

3. **Test Case 3:** `3 5 11`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`, so buy all 3 yogurts individually.
   - Cost: `3 * 5 = 15`.

4. **Test Case 4:** `4 5 11`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`, so buy all 4 yogurts individually.
   - Cost: `4 * 5 = 20`.

### Issues in the Code:
Upon closer inspection, we notice that the first condition is incorrect. The condition `if B * 2 < C` should actually be `if B * 2 <= C`. This is because if the cost of buying two yogurts individually (`2 * B`) is equal to the promotion price (`C`), it is still more economical to use the promotion.

Let's correct this and re-evaluate:

1. **Corrected Condition 1:** If `2 * B <= C`, it means buying two yogurts individually is not cheaper than the promotion. Therefore, the total cost should be calculated based on the promotion.
2. **Condition 2:** If `A` is even, the best strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs, so the total cost is `(A * C) / 2`.
3. **Condition 3:** If `A` is odd, buy as many pairs as possible (`A // 2` pairs) and pay `C` for each pair. Then, buy the remaining yogurt individually at price `B`. Thus, the total cost is `(A // 2) * C + B`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 <= C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Verification Against Example with Corrected Code:
1. **Test Case 1:** `2 5 9`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`, so buy 2 yogurts with the promotion.
   - Cost: `9`.

2. **Test Case 2:** `3 5 9`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`, so buy 2 yogurts with the promotion and 1 yogurt individually.
   - Cost: `9 + 5 = 14`.

3. **Test Case 3:** `3 5 11`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`, so buy all 3 yogurts individually.
   - Cost: `3 * 5 = 15`.

4. **Test Case 4:** `4 5 11`
   - `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`, so buy all 4 yogurts individually.
   - Cost: `4 * 5 = 20`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect due to the flawed condition `if B * 2 < C`. The corrected condition `if B * 2 <= C` ensures that the promotion is used whenever it is not more expensive than buying two yogurts individually.

**Final:** **False**
