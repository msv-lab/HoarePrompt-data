Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list `a`, `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `cnt` is updated by adding the floor division of `x` by 2 to it. The list `a` and its third element `x` remain unchanged.
