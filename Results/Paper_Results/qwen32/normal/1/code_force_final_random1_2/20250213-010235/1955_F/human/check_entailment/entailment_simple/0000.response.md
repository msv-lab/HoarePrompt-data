### Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to understand how the bitwise XOR operation works and how it affects the sequence of numbers. The key insight is that the XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even. Since the numbers in the sequence are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can analyze their binary representations:

- 1: 001
- 2: 010
- 3: 011
- 4: 100

For Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be zero. This means that the count of numbers contributing a '1' to each bit position must be even.

The strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins involves removing numbers in such a way that the remaining numbers have an even count of '1's in each bit position as often as possible.

Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

Here's what the code does:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
3. It adjusts each count to the nearest even number using `int(x) - int(x) % 2`.
4. It calculates the number of Bob's wins:
   - `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If they are, Bob can win once more by removing one of these numbers, making all counts even.
   - `sum(p) // 2` counts the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed while keeping the XOR zero. Each pair contributes to one win for Bob.

However, the code logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the optimal removal strategy for all scenarios. Specifically, it does not consider the interaction between the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s properly.

For example, in the second test case (`1 0 1 2`):
- The counts are adjusted to `[0, 0, 0, 2]`.
- The condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` evaluates to `False` because there are no odd counts among 1s, 2s, and 3s.
- `sum(p) // 2` evaluates to `1`, but this is incorrect because Eve can remove one 1 and one 3 to make the counts even, allowing Bob to win once.

Thus, the provided code does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win for all test cases.

### Correctness: **False**
