In this case, the loop head only contains the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The underscore `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the program, so it doesn't need to be adjusted. The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0.

Since the loop head does not include `a`, `cnt`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, or `p_4`, these variables do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The only thing that matters for the continuation of the loop is the value of `int(input())`.

However, since we don't have control over the input, we can only describe the state based on the given information. The state of `a` and `cnt` remains unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is a list containing the four non-negative integers `[p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4]`; `cnt` is its initial value plus `math.floor(p_1 / 2)` plus `math.floor(p_2 / 2)` plus `math.floor(p_3 / 2)` plus `math.floor(p_4 / 2)`**
