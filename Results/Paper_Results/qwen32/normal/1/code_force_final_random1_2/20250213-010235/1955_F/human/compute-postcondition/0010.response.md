Functionality: **The function accepts four non-negative integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence, respectively. It processes these counts for each of the up to 10,000 test cases provided. The function returns a result based on these counts for each test case.**
