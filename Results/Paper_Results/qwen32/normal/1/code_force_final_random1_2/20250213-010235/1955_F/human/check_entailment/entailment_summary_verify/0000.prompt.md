You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four non-negative integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on these counts. Specifically, it checks if exactly three of the first three counts are odd and adds this boolean condition (1 for true, 0 for false) to half the sum of all four counts rounded down to the nearest even number.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is zero.
- Eve removes one number at a time from the sequence.
- We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

### Key Points:
1. XOR properties:
   - XOR of two identical numbers is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.
   
2. Strategy for Bob to win:
   - Bob wins when the XOR of the remaining numbers is 0.
   - To achieve this, Eve needs to remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers becomes 0.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The provided program processes each test case by reading four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. It then modifies these counts by making them even and calculates the result based on the modified counts.

Here is the provided code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Modification of Counts**: The code makes the counts of ones, twos, and threes even by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2. However, this modification does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize Bob's wins by optimally removing numbers.
   
2. **Logic for Bob's Wins**: The logic `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2` does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Specifically:
   - `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3` checks if exactly three out of the first three counts (ones, twos, threes) are odd. This condition alone does not guarantee that Bob can win.
   - `sum(p) // 2` adds half of the total count of numbers (after making them even), which is not a valid strategy to determine Bob's wins.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, we need to consider the following:
- The XOR of the sequence is zero if and only if the counts of numbers contributing to each bit position (in binary representation) are even.
- For numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, their binary representations are:
  - 1: `001`
  - 2: `010`
  - 3: `011`
  - 4: `100`
- We need to ensure that the counts of numbers contributing to each bit position are even after each removal.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the provided code and the need for a more sophisticated approach to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, the provided program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. It incorrectly modifies the counts and uses a flawed condition to calculate the result.
