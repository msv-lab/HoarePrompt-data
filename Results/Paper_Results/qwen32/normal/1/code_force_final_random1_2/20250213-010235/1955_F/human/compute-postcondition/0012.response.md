To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the initial conditions and how the loop modifies the variable `cnt` based on the elements of the list `a`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `a` is a list containing four non-negative integers: `[p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4]`.
- `cnt` is initially set to 1 if `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are equal and odd; otherwise, `cnt` is 0.

### Loop Execution:
The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a` and updates `cnt` as follows:
```python
for x in a:
    cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
```
This means that for each element `x` in the list `a`, `cnt` is incremented by the integer division of `x` by 2 (`math.floor(x / 2)`).

### Iteration Details:
- **After 1st iteration (x = p_1)**: `cnt` becomes `cnt + math.floor(p_1 / 2)`
- **After 2nd iteration (x = p_2)**: `cnt` becomes `cnt + math.floor(p_2 / 2)`
- **After 3rd iteration (x = p_3)**: `cnt` becomes `cnt + math.floor(p_3 / 2)`
- **After 4th iteration (x = p_4)**: `cnt` becomes `cnt + math.floor(p_4 / 2)`

### Final Output State:
After all four iterations, the final value of `cnt` will be the sum of the integer divisions of each element in the list `a` by 2, added to the initial value of `cnt`.

Thus, the final `cnt` can be expressed as:
\[ \text{final\_cnt} = \text{initial\_cnt} + \left(\left\lfloor \frac{p_1}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{p_2}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{p_3}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{p_4}{2} \right\rfloor \right) \]

Where `initial_cnt` is either 1 or 0 based on the condition described above.

### Final Output State in Specified Format:
Output State: **`a` is a list containing the four non-negative integers `[p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4]`; `cnt` is its initial value plus `math.floor(p_1 / 2)` plus `math.floor(p_2 / 2)` plus `math.floor(p_3 / 2)` plus `math.floor(p_4 / 2)`**

In natural language, the final output state is that `cnt` is the initial value of `cnt` (which is 1 if `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are equal and odd, otherwise 0) plus the sum of the integer divisions of each element in the list `a` by 2. The list `a` remains unchanged.
