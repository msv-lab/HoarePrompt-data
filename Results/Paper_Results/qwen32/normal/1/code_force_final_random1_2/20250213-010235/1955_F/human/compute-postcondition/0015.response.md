The given code snippet reassigns the variable `a` to a new list of integers obtained from the input. This means the original list `a` containing the four non-negative integers `[p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4]` is replaced with whatever integers are provided in the input.

Since `a` is reassigned, the initial values `[p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4]` are no longer valid, and the new values of `a` are determined by the input. The variable `cnt` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt` is its initial value plus `math.floor(p_1 / 2)` plus `math.floor(p_2 / 2)` plus `math.floor(p_3 / 2)` plus `math.floor(p_4 / 2)`.**
