Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements where `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]` and `a[0] % 2 == 1`.
- `x` is `a[1]`.

Code Snippet:
```python
cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
```

Since `x` is `a[1]` and `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]`, we know `x` is an odd integer (because `a[0] % 2 == 1`).

Let's denote `a[0]` (and thus `x`) as `k`, where `k` is an odd integer. The operation `math.floor(x / 2)` will compute the floor division of `k` by 2. Since `k` is odd, `k / 2` will result in a non-integer, and `math.floor(k / 2)` will give us the largest integer less than or equal to `k / 2`. For example, if `k` is 5, `5 / 2` is 2.5, and `math.floor(2.5)` is 2.

Therefore, `cnt` will be incremented by `math.floor(k / 2)`, where `k` is the value of `a[0]` (or `a[1]` or `a[2]`).

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements where `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]` and `a[0] % 2 == 1`; `x` is `a[1]`; `cnt` is incremented by `math.floor(a[0] / 2)`**.

In simpler terms, `cnt` is increased by half of `a[0]` (rounded down), and all other conditions about `a` and `x` remain the same.
