Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input values, `i` is `k + 4` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that the program exits the most internal loop or if statement.
