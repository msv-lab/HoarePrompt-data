Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string. If the current index `i` satisfies either `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the loop or if statement continues to execute.**
