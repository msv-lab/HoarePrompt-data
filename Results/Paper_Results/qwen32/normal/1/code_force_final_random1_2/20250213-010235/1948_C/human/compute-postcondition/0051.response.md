Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is set to 1.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 5.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is an input string.
- `i` is set to 5.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet directly outputs the string `'No'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`) mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'No'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
