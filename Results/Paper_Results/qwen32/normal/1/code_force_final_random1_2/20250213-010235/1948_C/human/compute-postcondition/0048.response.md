Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `break` statement is that it exits the most internal loop or if statement.
