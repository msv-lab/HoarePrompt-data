### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given rules. However, the logic implemented in the code does not correctly address the problem requirements.

The program iterates through the columns of the grid starting from the second column (index 1) and checks for specific patterns involving '<' characters in the two rows. Specifically, it checks if there is any position `i` such that:
- `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or
- `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`

If such a pattern is found, it concludes that the robot cannot reach the target cell and prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

However, this logic is insufficient and incorrect for determining if the robot can reach the target cell. The robot's movement depends on a sequence of valid moves that involve both manual moves (up, down, left, right) and following the arrows. The program does not simulate these movements and instead relies on a flawed condition that does not cover all possible scenarios.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) based on the problem's rules. It needs to simulate the robot's movements according to the specified rules rather than relying on the presence of specific patterns in the grid.
