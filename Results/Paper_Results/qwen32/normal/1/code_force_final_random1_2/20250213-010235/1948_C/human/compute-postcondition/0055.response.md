To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the provided code snippet. The code processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two strings `a` and `b` of equal length `n`, and checks if certain conditions are met for each pair of characters at specific positions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Loop Structure**:
   - The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the inner loop iterates over the indices of the strings `a` and `b` starting from index 1 and incrementing by 2 each time (i.e., it checks every second character starting from the second character).

2. **Condition Check**:
   - Inside the inner loop, it checks if either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`.
   - If any of these conditions are true, it prints "No" and breaks out of the inner loop for that test case.
   - If none of these conditions are true for any iteration of the inner loop, it prints "Yes" after the inner loop completes.

3. **Output States**:
   - After the first iteration, the loop printed "Yes", indicating that the condition was not met for the first test case.
   - After the second iteration, it again printed "Yes", indicating the same for the second test case.
   - After the third iteration, it printed "Yes" as well, indicating the same for the third test case.

Given this pattern, we can infer that for all `t` test cases, the condition inside the inner loop was never met, leading to "Yes" being printed for each test case.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop would be a series of "Yes" outputs, one for each test case.

**Output State: **Yes Yes ... Yes** (repeated `t` times)**

In natural language, this means that for each of the `t` test cases, the code did not find any pair of characters that violated the specified condition, resulting in "Yes" being printed for each test case.
