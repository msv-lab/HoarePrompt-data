The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. It only exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed within. Since no changes are made to the variables, their states remain as they were initially described.

Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input values, `i` is `k + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
