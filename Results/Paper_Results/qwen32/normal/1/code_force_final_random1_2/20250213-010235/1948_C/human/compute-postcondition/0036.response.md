To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the provided information step-by-step.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n` with a step of 2 (`for i in range(1, n, 2)`).
- During each iteration, the loop checks two conditions:
  1. `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'`
  2. `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`
- If either condition is true, it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
- If none of the conditions are met during any iteration, it prints "Yes" after the loop completes.

### Initial State and Iterations:
- **Initial State:** `t` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are input values.
- **After 1st Iteration:** `i = 1`, no break, `t` is incremented by 1.
- **After 2nd Iteration:** `i = 3`, no break, `t` is incremented by 1.
- **After 3rd Iteration:** `i = 5`, no break, `t` is incremented by 1.

### Final Iteration:
- The loop will continue iterating as long as `i < n` and `i` increments by 2 each time.
- Since the loop did not break after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` and `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` were not met for `i = 1`, `i = 3`, and `i = 5`.
- This pattern will continue until `i` reaches a value where `i >= n`.

### Conclusion:
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it means none of the specified conditions were met for any `i` in the range.
- Therefore, the loop will print "Yes" after completing all iterations.

### Output State:
- `t` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, so if there are `m` iterations, `t` will be incremented by `m`.
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop, which they are not.

Given the pattern of the loop and the initial conditions, the final output state is:

Output State: **t is incremented by the number of iterations, and the loop prints "Yes".**
