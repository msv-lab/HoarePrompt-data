The initial state provides us with several variables and conditions, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables directly. The statement simply prints the string `'No'`.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `a` and `b` are input strings with specific conditions about their characters.

However, none of these variables or conditions affect the `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **No**
