Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The loop `for i in range(1, n, 2):` only checks every second column starting from the second column. This means it skips checking some columns and does not cover all possible paths the robot can take.
2. **Incorrect Condition**: The condition inside the loop `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':` is flawed. It does not properly check if the robot can move from one cell to another according to the rules specified in the problem statement.
3. **No Proper Path Checking**: The program does not simulate the robot's movement step-by-step to see if it can reach the target cell (2, n).

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the robot's movement step-by-step. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        
        # Starting position
        x, y = 1, 1
        
        # Simulate the robot's movement
        while (x, y) != (2, n):
            if x == 1:
                if a[y-1] == '>':
                    y += 1
                else:
                    x = 2
            else:
                if b[y-1] == '<':
                    y -= 1
                else:
                    x = 1
            
            # Check if the robot is out of bounds
            if y < 1 or y > n:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**: The robot starts at position (1, 1).
2. **Simulation Loop**: The robot moves according to the arrows in the grid until it either reaches (2, n) or goes out of bounds.
3. **Boundary Checks**: The program checks if the robot's position is within the grid boundaries after each move.
4. **Output**: If the robot reaches (2, n), it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

This corrected program ensures that all possible movements are considered and accurately determines if the robot can reach the target cell.
