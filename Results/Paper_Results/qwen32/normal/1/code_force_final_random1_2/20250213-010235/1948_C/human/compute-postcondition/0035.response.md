Postcondition: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input values, `i` is `k + 4`. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
