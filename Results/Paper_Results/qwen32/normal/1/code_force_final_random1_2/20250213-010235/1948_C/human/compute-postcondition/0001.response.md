To determine the necessary adjustments for the given loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, the critical variable to consider is `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.

Since `t` is already constrained to be within a valid range (1 to 10^4), no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1, which is already guaranteed by the problem statement.

Thus, the state before the loop starts does not need to be modified further regarding the loop's execution condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**
