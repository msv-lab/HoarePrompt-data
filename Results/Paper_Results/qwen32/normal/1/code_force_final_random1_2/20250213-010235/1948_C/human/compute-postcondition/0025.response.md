Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is incremented by 1 (This detail does not affect the print statement directly).
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` and `b` are input values.
- Either `a[i]` equals `b[i + 1]` and both equal `<` with `i + 1 < n`, or `a[i]` equals `b[i - 1]` and both equal `<`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is `'No'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
