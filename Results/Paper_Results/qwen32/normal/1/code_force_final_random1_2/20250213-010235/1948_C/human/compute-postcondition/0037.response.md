In this case, the loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use inside the loop. The loop runs `t` times, and based on the information provided, `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration (since it's described as "t is incremented by the number of iterations" in a way that suggests it's counting down).

Given that the loop prints "Yes" during each iteration, we need to ensure that there is still one more iteration left for the loop to execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was such that the loop ran.
2. Since the loop runs `t` times, and we just completed one iteration, `t` must have been decremented by 1.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be 1 (since if `t` were 0 or less, the loop would not execute).

State: **`t` is 1**
