Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list at index `i` contains all the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i`. `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes as computed by the BFS algorithm. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `i`. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing `b` followed by `n`. `n` is the predecessor of `path_ba[-2]` in the shortest path from node `0` to `path_ba[-2]`. The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
