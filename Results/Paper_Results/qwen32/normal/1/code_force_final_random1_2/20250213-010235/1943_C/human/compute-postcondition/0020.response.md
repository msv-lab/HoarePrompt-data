To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `u2vs` list based on the given inputs.

### Initial State:
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists.
- `n` is the integer input by the user.

### Loop Execution:
For each iteration of the loop:
1. Two integers `u` and `v` are read from the input.
2. Both `u` and `v` are decremented by 1 (to convert them into zero-based indices).
3. The value `v` is appended to the list at index `u` in `u2vs`.
4. The value `u` is appended to the list at index `v` in `u2vs`.

### Final Output State:
After `n-1` iterations, the `u2vs` list will represent an adjacency list of an undirected graph with `n` nodes. Each node (represented by an index in `u2vs`) will have a list of its neighboring nodes.

#### Description in Natural Language:
- `u2vs` will be a list of `n` lists.
- Each inner list at index `i` will contain all the indices (nodes) that are directly connected to node `i` in the graph.
- The connections are bidirectional, meaning if node `u` is connected to node `v`, then node `v` will also be connected to node `u`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state of `u2vs` will be an adjacency list representing the connections between nodes as specified by the input pairs.

**Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list at index `i` contains all the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i`. The connections are bidirectional.**
