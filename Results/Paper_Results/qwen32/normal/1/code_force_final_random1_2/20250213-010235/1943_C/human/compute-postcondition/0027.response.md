The given code snippet assigns the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` to the variable `n`. This means that `n` will now hold the predecessor of the last element in the `path_ba` list in the shortest path from node `0` to that node.

Given the initial state:
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list at index `i` contains all the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i`.
- `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes as computed by the BFS algorithm.
- `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `i`.
- `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `path_ba` is a list containing `b`.

After executing the line `n = previous[path_ba[-1]]`, the variable `n` is updated to the predecessor of the last element in `path_ba`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list at index `i` contains all the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i`; `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes as computed by the BFS algorithm; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `i`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing `b`; `n` is the predecessor of `path_ba[-1]` in the shortest path from node `0` to `path_ba[-1]`.**
