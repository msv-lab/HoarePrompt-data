The value of `v` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n+1` lists, where the list at index `v` contains the value `v` and the new value `u`; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1; `n` is increased by 1.**
