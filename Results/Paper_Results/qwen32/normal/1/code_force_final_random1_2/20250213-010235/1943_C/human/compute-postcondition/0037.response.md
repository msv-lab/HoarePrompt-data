In this case, the `while` loop is `while True:`, which means the loop will continue indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement inside the loop body. Since the loop condition is always `True`, no adjustments to the program state are necessary to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

Therefore, the state remains the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list at index `i` contains all the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i`. `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes as computed by the BFS algorithm. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `i`. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing `b`, `n`, and the newly appended `n`. `n` is the predecessor of `path_ba[-2]` in the shortest path from node `0` to `path_ba[-2]`.**
