The code snippet appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `c1` is calculated as `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`, and `i` is not defined in the initial state, so it must be assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code. Since `i` is not specified, we'll keep it as `i`.

The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `c2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, `d` is a list of shortest distances, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of predecessors, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and its predecessors with a length of at least 3, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c1, i)`, `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, `c1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`**.
