The code snippet assigns the list containing the single element `b` to the variable `path_ba`. This means `path_ba` now holds a list with `b` as its only element. The values of `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list at index `i` contains all the indices of nodes directly connected to node `i`; `d` is a list of shortest distances from node `0` to all other nodes as computed by the BFS algorithm; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path from node `0` to node `i`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing `b`.**
