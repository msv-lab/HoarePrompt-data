The code appends a new tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. The values of `c1` and `i` remain unchanged, and the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, `d` is a list of shortest distances, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is a list of predecessors, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and its predecessors with a length of at least 3, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` and the newly appended tuple `(c1, i)`, `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, `c1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`, `i` is `i + 2`.**
