The code appends the value `u` to the list located at index `v` in the list `u2vs`. Given the initial state, the list at index `v` originally contains the values `[v, v]`. After appending `u`, the list at index `v` will contain `[v, v, u]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n+1` lists, where the list at index `u` contains the value `u`, the original value `v`, and the newly appended value `v`; the list at index `v` now contains `[v, v, u]`; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1; `n` is increased by 1.**
