The code appends a `BalanceInfo` object to the `balance_info` list with the current values of `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`. Given the initial state, `balance` is 0, `i` is 0, and `s[i]` is the first character of the string `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing one `BalanceInfo` object with `balance` as 0, `i` as 0, and `s[i]` as the first character of `s`; `balance` is 0; `i` is 0**.
