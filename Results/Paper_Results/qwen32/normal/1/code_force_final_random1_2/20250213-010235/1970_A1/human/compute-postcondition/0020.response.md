Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing `n` `BalanceInfo` objects, each representing the balance, index, and character at that index in the string `s`; `balance` is 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `balance_info` will contain a `BalanceInfo` object for every character in the string `s`. Each `BalanceInfo` object will store the balance at that point in the string, the index of the character, and the character itself. Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the final value of `balance` will be 0, indicating that the number of opening and closing parentheses are equal and properly nested.
