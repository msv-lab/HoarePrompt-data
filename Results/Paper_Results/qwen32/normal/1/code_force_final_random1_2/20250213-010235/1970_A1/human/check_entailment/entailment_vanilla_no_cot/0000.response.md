To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its components and logic step-by-step against the problem requirements.

### Analysis:

1. **Data Structure `BalanceInfo`**: 
   The code references a `BalanceInfo` class which is not defined in the provided snippet. This class should store three attributes: `balance`, `position`, and `character`. Since the class is not defined, we assume it exists and works as intended.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function seems to compare two instances of `BalanceInfo` based on their `balance` attribute. If the balances are different, it returns the difference. If they are the same, it returns the negative difference of their `position` attributes.
   - This comparison aligns with the sorting criteria described in the problem statement: sort by `balance` in ascending order and by `position` in descending order when balances are equal.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It calculates the balance of the prefix for each character in the input string `s`.
   - It creates a list of `BalanceInfo` objects containing the balance, position, and character for each position in the string.
   - It sorts this list according to the criteria specified in `func_1`.
   - Finally, it constructs the resulting string by joining the `character` attributes of the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects and prints the result.

### Verification:

- **Sorting Criteria**: The sorting key used in `func_2` (`key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position)`) matches the criteria mentioned in the problem statement.
- **Result Construction**: The final result is constructed by concatenating the characters from the sorted list, which should give the correct balanced shuffle as per the problem definition.

### Conclusion:

Given the assumptions about the `BalanceInfo` class and the logical alignment of the provided functions with the problem statement, the program appears to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation.

Therefore, the response is:

**Correctness: True**
