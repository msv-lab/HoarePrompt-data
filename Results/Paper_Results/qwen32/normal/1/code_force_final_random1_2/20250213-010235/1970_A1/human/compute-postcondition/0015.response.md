To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `balance_info` is a list containing two `BalanceInfo` objects.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

The loop iterates over the range of `n`, meaning it will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Increment `i`:** Since the loop increments `i` at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

2. **Check `n`:** The variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop iterations as it represents the length of the string `s`.

3. **Adjust `balance_info`:** The `balance_info` list is updated based on the character at the current position `i` in the string `s`. However, since `balance_info` is not part of the loop head, we do not need to adjust it here. It will be recalculated within the loop body.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the increment of `i`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing two `BalanceInfo` objects; `i` is `i + 1`.** 

Since we need to specify the exact state, let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing two `BalanceInfo` objects; `i` is `i + 1`.**

For clarity, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing two `BalanceInfo` objects; `i` is 3.**

Generalizing this, if `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing two `BalanceInfo` objects; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing two `BalanceInfo` objects; `i` is `i + 1`.**
