#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is an integer representing the position of the character in the sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between `infoA.balance` and `infoB.balance`. Since `infoA.balance` is not equal to `infoB.balance`, the result will be a non-zero integer.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is an integer representing the position of the character in the sequence. Additionally, the balance of infoA is equal to the balance of infoB.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two objects, `infoA` and `infoB`, each with `balance` and `position` attributes. It returns the difference between `infoA.balance` and `infoB.balance` if they are not equal, otherwise, it returns 0.

        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing `n` `BalanceInfo` objects, each representing the balance, index, and character at that index in the string `s`; `balance` is 0.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: s (where s is the original balanced parentheses sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and prints the same string `s`.
