Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing two `BalanceInfo` objects, the first one from the initial state and the second one with the arguments `balance + 1`, `i`, and `s[i]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `balance` is incremented by 1. The values of `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `balance_info` list now includes a new `BalanceInfo` object with the updated `balance` value and the current `i` and `s[i]`.
