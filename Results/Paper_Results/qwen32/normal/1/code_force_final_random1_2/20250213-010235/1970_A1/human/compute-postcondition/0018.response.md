The code snippet provided decrements the value of `balance` by 1. Given the initial state, the only variable affected by this operation is `balance`. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `balance_info`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing three `BalanceInfo` objects (two from the initial state plus the newly appended one); `i` is `i + 1`; `balance` is decreased by 1.**
