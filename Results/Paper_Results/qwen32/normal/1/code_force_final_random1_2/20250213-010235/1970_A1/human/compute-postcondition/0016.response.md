The code appends a new `BalanceInfo` object to the `balance_info` list with the arguments `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before this operation, but since the increment happens before the code snippet provided, we consider the current value of `i` for the `BalanceInfo` object.

After the operation, `balance_info` will contain one more element, and `i` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing three `BalanceInfo` objects (two from the initial state plus the newly appended one); `i` is `i + 1`.**
