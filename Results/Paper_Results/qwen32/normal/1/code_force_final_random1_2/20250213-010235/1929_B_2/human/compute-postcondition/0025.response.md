To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This variable represents the number of test cases, but it is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
   - `s` is the next line from the input file. This line contains two space-separated integers.
   - `n` and `k` are integers obtained from splitting and mapping the string `s`. Specifically, `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer from the line `s`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2 * n)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet multiplies the integer `n` by 2 and prints the result.
   - Since `n` is derived from the input line `s`, we cannot determine its exact value without knowing the specific input. However, we know that `n` is an integer.

4. **Output Description:**
   - The output will be twice the value of `n`.

Given this analysis, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **2 * n (where n is the first integer obtained from splitting and mapping the string s)**
