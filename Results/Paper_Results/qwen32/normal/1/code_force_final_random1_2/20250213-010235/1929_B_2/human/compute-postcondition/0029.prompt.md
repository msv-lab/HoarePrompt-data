Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    n, k = map(int, s.split())
    if k <= 4 * n - 4:
        print(math.ceil(k / 2))
    elif k == 4 * n - 3:
        print(2 * n - 1)
    elif k == 4 * n - 2:
        print(2 * n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), and there are at least \(t\) lines of input following the first line, each containing two integers \(n\) and \(k\) such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2\). If \(k \leq 4n - 4\), no additional changes are made to the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. If \(k = 4n - 3\), no additional changes are made to the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. If \(k = 4n - 2\), a specific condition for \(k\) is met; otherwise, no additional changes are made to the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from splitting and mapping the string `s`; `s` is no longer relevant. If `k` is less than or equal to \(4 \times n - 4\), the condition is satisfied. If `k` equals \(4 \times n - 3\) or \(4 \times n - 2\), the condition is satisfied. For all other values of `k`, the condition is not satisfied.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `s` is the next line from the input file; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from splitting and mapping the string `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to \(4 \times n - 4\), no further action is taken. If `k` equals \(4 \times n - 3\) or \(4 \times n - 2\), no further action is taken. Otherwise, no further action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
