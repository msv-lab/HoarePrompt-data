To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each input pair `(n, k)` and prints a result based on the value of `k` relative to `n`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. The loop iterates over `t` lines of input, where each line contains two integers `n` and `k`.
2. For each pair `(n, k)`, the code checks the value of `k` and prints a corresponding result:
   - If `k <= 4 * n - 4`, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
   - If `k == 4 * n - 3`, it prints `2 * n - 1`.
   - If `k == 4 * n - 2`, it prints `2 * n`.

After processing all `t` lines, the loop ends, and no further changes are made to `t`, `n`, or `k` outside the loop.

### Final Output State:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the total number of input pairs processed.
- The variables `n` and `k` will hold the values of the last processed input pair after the loop finishes.

However, since the question asks for the output state after all iterations, we focus on the printed results rather than the final values of `n` and `k`.

### Human-readable Explanation:
The final output state consists of `t` printed lines, each corresponding to the result of processing one input pair `(n, k)` according to the specified conditions. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` themselves do not change outside the loop, but the printed results reflect the outcomes of all iterations.

### Final Output State Format:
Output State: **t lines of printed results, each determined by the conditions on k relative to n.**

This means that after all iterations, the output will be a series of `t` lines, each line being the result of the computation based on the respective `n` and `k` values from the input.
