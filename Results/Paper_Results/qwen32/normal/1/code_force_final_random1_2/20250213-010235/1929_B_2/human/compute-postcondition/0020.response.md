Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on whether `k` equals `4 * n - 2`. If `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, it prints `k // 2 + 1`; otherwise, it prints the ceiling of `k / 2`.**
