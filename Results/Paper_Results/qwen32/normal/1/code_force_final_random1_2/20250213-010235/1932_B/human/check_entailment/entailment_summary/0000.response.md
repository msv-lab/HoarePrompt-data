### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program and see if it aligns with the problem requirements.

The problem states that the signs must occur sequentially, meaning that after the i-th sign occurs in year `x`, the tribe waits for the (i+1)-th sign to occur strictly after year `x`. Specifically, the (i+1)-th sign must occur in the smallest year `y > x` such that `y` is a multiple of `a_(i+1)`.

The program uses the following logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs:
- It initializes `year` to 0.
- For each sign's periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, it updates `year` using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.

This expression can be broken down as follows:
- `year % ai` computes the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`.
- If `year % ai` is not zero, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, and we need to find the next multiple of `ai` after `year`. This is done by adding `ai - (year % ai)` to `year`. However, the expression `year % ai or ai` simplifies this to just adding `ai` because `year % ai` being non-zero will make the `or` statement evaluate to `year % ai`, and thus `year + year % ai` effectively skips to the next multiple of `ai`.
- If `year % ai` is zero, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so the next occurrence of the sign is exactly at `year + ai`.

Thus, the expression `year += year % ai or ai` correctly updates `year` to the next occurrence of the sign according to its periodicity `ai`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, and hence the year when the apocalypse will happen.

Correctness: **True**
