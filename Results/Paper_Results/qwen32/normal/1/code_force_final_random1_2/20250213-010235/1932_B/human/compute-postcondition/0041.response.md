Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where the first two tuples have non-empty lists as their second elements, `results` is a list containing one element which is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`, `test` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and is a non-empty list, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `ai` is `a[j+1]`. If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.**
