Functionality: **The function takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the integers in each tuple's list and returns a list of these LCMs.**
