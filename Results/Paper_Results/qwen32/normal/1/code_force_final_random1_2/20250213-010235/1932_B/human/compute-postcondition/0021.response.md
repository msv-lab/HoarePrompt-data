To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `ai` and `a`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `year` was updated to `year + (year % ai or ai)`, and `ai` was the second element of the list `a`.
- The list `a` must contain at least two elements.

Since `ai` is the loop variable, it will take the value of the next element in the list `a` during the next iteration. Given that `ai` was the second element in the previous iteration, it will now take the value of the third element in the list `a` (if it exists).

Let's update the state accordingly:

- `ai` will be the third element of the list `a`.
- `a` remains the same as it is the list being iterated over.

State: **`year` is `year + (year % ai or ai)`, `a` is a list of integers that must contain at least two elements, `ai` is the third element of the list `a`**.

Note: We don't need to specify the exact value of `year` since it is dependent on the current value of `ai` and the previous value of `year`. The important part is that `ai` is now the third element of the list `a`.
