### Reasoning:

The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Calculating the Year for Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes a variable `year` to 0, which keeps track of the current year.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, it calculates the next occurrence of the sign using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.
     - This expression ensures that the next occurrence of the sign happens at the next multiple of `ai` after the current `year`.
     - If `year % ai` is not zero, it means the current `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, so we need to add the difference to reach the next multiple of `ai`. This is done by `year + (ai - year % ai)`, which is equivalent to `year + ai - year % ai`.
     - If `year % ai` is zero, it means the current `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so the next occurrence is simply `year + ai`.
     - The expression `year % ai or ai` effectively captures this logic in a concise manner. If `year % ai` is non-zero, it uses `year % ai`; otherwise, it uses `ai`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the final `year` value, which represents the year when the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the first example provided:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
  - Calculation:
    - Start with `year = 0`.
    - First sign: `year = 0 + 3 = 3` (next multiple of 3 after 0).
    - Second sign: `year = 3 + 1 = 4` (next multiple of 2 after 3).
    - Third sign: `year = 4 + 4 = 8` (next multiple of 4 after 4).
    - Fourth sign: `year = 8 + 2 = 10` (next multiple of 5 after 8).
    - Fifth sign: `year = 10 + 8 = 18` (next multiple of 9 after 10).
    - Sixth sign: `year = 18 + 18 = 36` (next multiple of 18 after 18).
  - Output: `36`

The program correctly computes the year for each test case as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year when the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
