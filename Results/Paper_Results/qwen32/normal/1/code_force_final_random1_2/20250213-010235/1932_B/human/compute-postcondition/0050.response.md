Output State: **`current_year` is 0, `results` now includes the LCM of all elements in `a` as its last element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases` and has at least two elements where the second element (`a`) is a non-empty list, `n` is the first element of `test`, `a` is the second element of `test` and has at least one element, and `current_year` is divisible by `ai`; `next_year` is `ai`.**

Explanation: The value of `next_year` is calculated as `current_year + ai`, which simplifies to `ai` since `current_year` is 0. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
