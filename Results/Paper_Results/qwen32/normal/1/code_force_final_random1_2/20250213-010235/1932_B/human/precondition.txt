t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case and contains an integer n followed by a list of n integers representing the periodicities of the signs.
