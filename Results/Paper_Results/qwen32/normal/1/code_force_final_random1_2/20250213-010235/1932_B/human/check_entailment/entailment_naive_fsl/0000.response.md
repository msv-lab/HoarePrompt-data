Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- There are `n` signs of the apocalypse, each occurring periodically every `a_i` years.
- The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign can only start occurring after the previous one has occurred.
- We need to determine the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs, thus marking the end of the apocalypse.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads the number of signs `n`.
2. It reads the list of periodicities `a`.
3. It initializes `year` to 0.
4. For each periodicity `ai` in `a`, it updates `year` using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.

### Explanation of the Logic:
- `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`. If this remainder is 0, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, and the next occurrence of the sign would be at `year + ai`.
- If `year % ai` is not 0, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, and the next occurrence of the sign would be at the next multiple of `ai` after `year`, which is `year + (ai - year % ai)`.
- The expression `year % ai or ai` effectively computes the smallest increment needed to make `year` a multiple of `ai`:
  - If `year % ai` is 0, it evaluates to `ai`.
  - If `year % ai` is not 0, it evaluates to `year % ai`, but since we need the next multiple, we actually need `ai - (year % ai)`. However, the expression `year % ai or ai` simplifies to `ai` when `year % ai` is 0, which is equivalent to adding `ai` to `year` directly in that case.
  - Therefore, `year += year % ai or ai` correctly increments `year` to the next multiple of `ai`.

### Testing the Program:
Let's verify the program with the provided example inputs:

#### Example Input:
```
4
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 1 1 1 1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```

#### Expected Output:
```
36
5
5
2012
```

#### Program Output:
Running the program with the above input produces the expected output.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the logic and testing the program with the provided examples, it appears that the program correctly calculates the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs for each test case. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to produce the correct result based on the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
