To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element.
- `ans` is a list containing `arr[i]` and `tem`.
- `tem` is `arr[i] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`.
- `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.

Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, we need to decrement `i` by 1 to get the state at the start of the next iteration.

Let's calculate the new value of `i`:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `len(arr) - 2`.
- At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `len(arr) - 3`.

The other variables (`arr`, `ans`, `tem`) are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone. However, if the loop body modifies these variables, their values would change accordingly during the execution of the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `ans` is a list containing `arr[i]` and `tem`; `tem` is `arr[i] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`; `i` is `len(arr) - 3`.**

Note: The values of `ans` and `tem` are dependent on the current value of `i` and the contents of `arr`, but since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, we leave `ans` and `tem` as described.
