The value of `tem` is updated by multiplying its current value with `arr[i]`. Given that `tem` was initially `arr[i] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`, after the operation `tem *= arr[i]`, `tem` becomes `arr[i] * arr[len(arr) - 2] * arr[i]`, which simplifies to `arr[i]**2 * arr[len(arr) - 2]`.

The values of `arr`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `ans` is a list containing `arr[i]` and `tem`; `tem` is `arr[i]**2 * arr[len(arr) - 2]`; `i` is `len(arr) - 3`.**
