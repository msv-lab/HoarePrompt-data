Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not contain any implementation for solving the problem described. It only includes several utility functions (`func_1` through `func_9`) that perform various operations like reading input, mapping input to integers, sorting lists, and calculating cumulative products. None of these functions address the core problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array.

To solve the problem, we need to implement a function that processes each test case, calculates the optimal permutation to add to the array, and determines the maximum frequency of any element in the modified array. The current code does not provide this functionality, hence it is incorrect according to the problem description.
