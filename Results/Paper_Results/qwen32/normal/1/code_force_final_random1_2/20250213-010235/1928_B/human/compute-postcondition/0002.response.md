To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):`, which involves the variable `i` and the length of `arr`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop iterates from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0` (inclusive). This means that `i` will take on values starting from the last index of `arr` and decrementing until it reaches `0`.
   
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, `len(arr)` must be greater than `0`. If `arr` is empty (`len(arr) == 0`), the loop will not execute because the range would be `range(-1, -1, -1)`, which is empty.

3. **Adjustments Needed**: To ensure the loop executes, `arr` must contain at least one element. The initial value of `i` should be set to `len(arr) - 1`, but since this is determined by the length of `arr` at the start of the loop, we don't need to explicitly set `i`. However, we do need to ensure `arr` has at least one element.

4. **Other Variables**: The variables `ans` and `tem` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. They can remain as they are.

Given these points, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `ans` is an empty list; `tem` is 1**.
