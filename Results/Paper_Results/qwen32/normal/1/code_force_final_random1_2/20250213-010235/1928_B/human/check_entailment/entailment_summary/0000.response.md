### Reasoning:

To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum frequency of any element in the array after adding a permutation of numbers from 1 to n to the array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach used in the code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1()` is used to read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `func_1()` reads the size of the array `n`.
   - `func_3()` reads the array `arr` of `n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The array `arr` is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then sorted.
   - `m` is set to the maximum value in the sorted array, although it is not used further in the logic.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the maximum frequency of any element after the permutation addition.

3. **Finding Maximum Frequency:**
   - For each unique element `arr[i]` in the sorted array, the code calculates the position `a` where `arr[i] + n` would fit in the sorted array using `bisect_left`.
   - The difference `d` between `a` and `i` gives the count of elements that can be transformed to `arr[i] + k` (where `k` ranges from 1 to `n`) such that they become equal to some element in the array.
   - `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `d`.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the maximum frequency `ans` is printed.

### Analysis of Provided Functions:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Reads an integer from the input.
- **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: Reads a space-separated list of integers from the input.
- The rest of the functions (`func_2`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, `func_8`, `func_9`) are not used in the provided code snippet and thus do not affect the correctness of this specific implementation.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum frequency of any element in the array after adding a permutation. It efficiently uses the `bisect_left` function to calculate the number of elements that can be transformed to match another element in the array. Therefore, the program meets the problem requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
