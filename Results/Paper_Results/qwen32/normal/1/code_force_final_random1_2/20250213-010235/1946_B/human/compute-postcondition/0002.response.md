The code snippet `b = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
