Postcondition: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`; `smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], suf[2], ..., suf[n])]`; `sm` is `suf[2] - smin[2]` if `suf[2] - smin[2] > sm` or `sm == -111`, otherwise `sm` remains unchanged; `j` is `j + n`; `t` remains the same; `b` is a list of substrings from the input; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `k` is `int(b[1])`; `l` is a list of integers from the input; `i` is 2`.**
