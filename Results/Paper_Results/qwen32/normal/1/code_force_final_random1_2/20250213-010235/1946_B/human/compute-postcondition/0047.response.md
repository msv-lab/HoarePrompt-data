Output State: **`suf` is a list `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`; `smin` is a list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`; `sm` is `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)` and is less than 0; `a` is `-sm // (10 ** 9 + 7)`**

Explanation: The value of `sm` is updated by adding `(a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
