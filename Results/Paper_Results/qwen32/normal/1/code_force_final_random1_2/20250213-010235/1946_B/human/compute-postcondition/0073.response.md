To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop is `for i in range(n):`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `j + n - 1` (since `j` is incremented by `n` in each iteration).
- `n` remains unchanged.

Since `i` is the variable being iterated over, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. 

Let's break it down:

1. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l)]`
   - `smin` is `[0, suf[i + 1]]` if `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`, otherwise `smin` is `[0, 0]`
   - `sm` is calculated based on the final `suf[n]`
   - `j` is `j + n`
   - `t` remains the same
   - `b` is a list of strings from the input
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0
   - `k` is `int(b[1])`
   - `l` is a list of integers from the input
   - `i` is `j + n - 1`

2. **Adjustments needed for the start of the next iteration:**
   - Since `i` is the loop variable, it needs to be incremented by 1.
   - All other variables (`suf`, `smin`, `sm`, `j`, `t`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`suf` is [0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l)], `smin` is [0, suf[i + 1]] if suf[i + 1] < smin[i], otherwise `smin` is [0, 0], `sm` is calculated based on the final suf[n], `j` is j + n, `t` remains the same, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is int(b[1]), `l` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is j + n**
