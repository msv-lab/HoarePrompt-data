Postcondition: **`suf` is [0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l)], `smin` is [0, suf[i + 1]] if suf[i + 1] < smin[i], otherwise `smin` is [0, 0], with an additional element `suf[j + n + 1]` appended if `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`, otherwise `smin[j + n]` is appended, `sm` is calculated based on the final suf[n], `j` is j + n, `t` remains the same, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is int(b[1]), `l` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is j + n`.**
