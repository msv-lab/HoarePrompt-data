The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0. Since the loop iterates over `range(n + 1)`, the next value for `i` should be 1.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.

Other variables (`suf`, `smin`, `sm`, `j`, `t`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`) are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

State: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], suf[2], ..., suf[n])]`, `sm` is `0` if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm` is `-111`, `j` is `j + n`, `t` remains the same, `b` is a list of substrings from the input, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is `int(b[1])`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1**
