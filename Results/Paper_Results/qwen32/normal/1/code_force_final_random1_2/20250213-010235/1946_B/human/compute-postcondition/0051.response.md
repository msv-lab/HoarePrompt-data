To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the calculation of `sm`.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`suf` List Construction:**
   - `suf` is constructed such that each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of list `l`.
   - For example, if `l = [1, 2, 3]`, then `suf = [0, 1, 3, 6]`.

2. **`smin` List Construction:**
   - `smin` is constructed such that each element at index `i` is the minimum of the corresponding element in `suf` and the previous element in `smin`.
   - For example, if `suf = [0, 1, 3, 6]`, then `smin = [0, 0, 0, 0]`.

3. **Calculation of `sm`:**
   - If `sm < 0`, then `sm` is calculated as `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10`.
   - Otherwise, `sm` is calculated as `(2 + suf[n]) % (10`.

### Key Points:

- `suf[n]` is the last element of the `suf` list, which is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- The exact value of `a` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot compute the exact value of `sm` if it were negative.
- Since `suf[n]` is a sum of non-negative numbers (assuming `l` contains non-negative numbers), `suf[n]` is non-negative.
- Therefore, `sm` will always be calculated as `(2 + suf[n]) % 10`.

### Conclusion:

Given that `suf[n]` is the sum of all elements in `l` and assuming `l` contains non-negative numbers, `suf[n]` will be non-negative. Thus, `sm` will be calculated as `(2 + suf[n]) % 10`.

Output: **(2 + suf[n]) % 10 (where suf[n] is the sum of all elements in list l)**
