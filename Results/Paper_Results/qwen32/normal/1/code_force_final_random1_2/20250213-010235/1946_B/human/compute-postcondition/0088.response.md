Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `suf` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 up to the sum of list `l`.
- `smin` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding element in `suf` and the previous element in `smin`.
- `sm` is the maximum difference between elements in `suf` and `smin`.
- `j` is incremented by `n`.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `b` is a list of strings from the input.
- `n` is an integer from `b[0]` and must be at least 0.
- `k` is an integer from `b[1]`.
- `l` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is `(j + n) + 1`.

Code Snippet:
```python
sm = suf[i] - smin[i]
```

Impact:
- The value of `sm` is updated to the difference between `suf[i]` and `smin[i]`.

Output State:
- `suf` remains the same.
- `smin` remains the same.
- `sm` is updated to `suf[i] - smin[i]`.
- `j` remains the same.
- `t` remains the same.
- `b` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.
- `l` remains the same.
- `i` remains the same.

Output State: **`suf` is [0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l)], `smin` is [0, suf[1] if suf[1] < smin[0] else smin[0], suf[2] if suf[2] < smin[1] else smin[1], ..., suf[n] if suf[n] < smin[n-1] else smin[n-1]], `sm` is suf[i] - smin[i], `j` is j + n, `t` remains the same, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is an integer from b[0] and must be at least 0, `k` is an integer from b[1], `l` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is (j + n) + 1**.
