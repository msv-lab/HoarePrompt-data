Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `suf` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum up to that point in the list `l`.
- `smin` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the current cumulative sum (`suf[i]`) and the previous minimum (`smin[i-1]`).
- `sm` is calculated as `2 + suf[n]`, and it is given that `sm` is less than 0.
- We are tasked with executing the line `a = abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

### Calculation:
- Since `sm` is less than 0, `abs(sm)` will convert `sm` to its positive equivalent.
- The expression `abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)` computes the integer division of the absolute value of `sm` by `10 ** 9 + 7`.

### Output State:
- `suf` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code snippet.
- `smin` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code snippet.
- `sm` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code snippet.
- `a` is newly introduced and is assigned the value of `abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`suf` is [0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l)], `smin` is [0, suf[1] if suf[1] < smin[0] else smin[0], suf[2] if suf[2] < smin[1] else smin[1], ..., suf[n] if suf[n] < smin[n-1] else smin[n-1]], `sm` is 2 + suf[n] and `sm` is less than 0, `a` is abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)**

In natural language, the output state means that `suf`, `smin`, and `sm` retain their initial values, while a new variable `a` is introduced with the value of the absolute value of `sm` divided by `10 ** 9 + 7`.
