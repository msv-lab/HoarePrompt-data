The given code snippet modifies the variable `sm` by adding the value of `suf[n]` to it. Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], suf[2], ..., suf[n])]`, `sm` is `(2 + suf[n])`**

In natural language, the output state is: `suf` remains the same list of cumulative sums, `smin` remains the same list starting with 0 followed by the minimum of the elements from `suf[1]` to `suf[n]`, and `sm` is now equal to its previous value (which was 2) plus the value of `suf[n]`.
