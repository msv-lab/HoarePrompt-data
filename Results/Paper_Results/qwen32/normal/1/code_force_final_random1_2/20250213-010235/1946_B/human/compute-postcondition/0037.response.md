The code snippet updates the value of `sm` to be the difference between `suf[i]` and `smin[i]`. The values of `suf` and `smin` remain unchanged, and `i` is already incremented before the code snippet is executed.

Given that `sm` was previously the maximum of its previous value and `suf[i] - smin[i]`, after executing the code snippet, `sm` will be set to `suf[i] - smin[i]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
Output State: **`suf` is a list `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is a list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `sm` is `suf[i] - smin[i]`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. `i` is `i + 1`**.
