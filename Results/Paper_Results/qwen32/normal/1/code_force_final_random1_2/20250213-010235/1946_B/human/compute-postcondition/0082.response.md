Output State: **`suf` is [0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l)], `smin` is [0, suf[1] if suf[1] < smin[0] else smin[0], suf[2] if suf[2] < smin[1] else smin[1], ..., suf[n] if suf[n] < smin[n-1] else smin[n-1]], `sm` is -111, `j` is j + n, `t` remains the same, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is int(b[0]), `k` is int(b[1]), `l` is a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The value of `sm` has been changed to `-111`. All other variables remain unchanged.
