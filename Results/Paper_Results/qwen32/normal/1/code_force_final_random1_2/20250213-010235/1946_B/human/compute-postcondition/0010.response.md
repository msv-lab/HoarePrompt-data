The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was used to append a new element to `suf`, which is `suf[i] + l[i]`. Since `i` was used in this context, it must have been a valid index at that point. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 to move to the next element.

Given that `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to have started, and since `i` was a valid index in the previous iteration, `i` must have been less than `n` at that point. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` should now be incremented, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `suf` has a new element appended, which is `suf[i] + l[i]`; `l` remains unchanged; `i` is `i + 1`** 

However, since we need to specify the exact state at the start of the next iteration without referring to the previous `i`, we can say:

State: **`n` must be greater than the current `i`; `suf` has a new element appended, which is `suf[i] + l[i]`; `l` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1** 

To be precise and adhering strictly to the requirement to only adjust the objects in the loop head:

State: **`n` must be greater than `i`; `i` is `i + 1`**
