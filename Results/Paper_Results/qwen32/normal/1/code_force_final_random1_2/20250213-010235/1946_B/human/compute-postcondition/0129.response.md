The code appends `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. This means the last element of `smin` will now be `suf[i + 1]`.

Given the initial state, `smin` was defined as `[0, min(suf[i + 1], smin[i]), ..., min(suf[i + 1], smin[i])]`. After appending `suf[i + 1]`, the new `smin` will include this additional element at the end.

No other variables are modified by the given line of code.

Output State: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is `[0, min(suf[i + 1], smin[i]), ..., min(suf[i + 1], smin[i]), suf[i + 1]]`, `sm` is updated based on the given conditions, `j` is `j + n`, `t` remains the same, `b` is a list of substrings from the input, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is `int(b[1])`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `i + 1`**.
