Postcondition: **`suf` is `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is `[0, min(suf[1], suf[2], ..., suf[n])]`, `sm` is `0` if `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm` is `-111`, `j` is `j + n`, `t` remains the same, `b` is a list of substrings from the input, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is `int(b[1])`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 0**.
