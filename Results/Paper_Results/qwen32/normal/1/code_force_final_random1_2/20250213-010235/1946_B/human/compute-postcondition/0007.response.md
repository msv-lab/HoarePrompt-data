The code appends the integer `0` to the list `suf`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of `b[0]`, `k` is the integer value of `b[1]`, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping the split input to integers, `suf` is a list containing the single element `[0]`.**
