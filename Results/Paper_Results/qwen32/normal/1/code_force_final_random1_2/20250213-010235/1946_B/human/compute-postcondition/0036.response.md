The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_prev`) and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `i_prev + 1`. The value of `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`suf` is a list `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is a list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `suf[i] - smin[i]`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`suf` is a list `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is a list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `suf[i] - smin[i]`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Given the previous iteration ended with `i` being some value, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1`.

State: **`suf` is a list `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is a list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `suf[i] - smin[i]`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. `i` is `i + 1`**.

To be more specific, if `i` was 0 at the start of the first iteration, after the first iteration, `i` would be 1, and so on. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`suf` is a list `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is a list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `suf[i] - smin[i]`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. `i` is 4 (assuming the previous value of `i` was 3)**.

However, without knowing the exact previous value of `i`, the most accurate general form is:

State: **`suf` is a list `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is a list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `suf[i] - smin[i]`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. `i` is `i + 1`**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`suf` is a list `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is a list `[0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]`, `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `suf[i] - smin[i]`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. `i` is `i + 1`**.
