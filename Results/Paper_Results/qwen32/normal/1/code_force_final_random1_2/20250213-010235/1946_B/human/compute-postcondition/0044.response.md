The value of `sm` is incremented by `suf[n]`. Given the initial state, `sm` was 2, and after adding `suf[n]` to it, the new value of `sm` is `2 + suf[n]`. The other variables (`suf` and `smin`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`suf` is a list [0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]; `smin` is a list [0, min(suf[1], 0), min(suf[2], smin[1]), ..., min(suf[n], smin[n-1])]; `sm` is 2 + suf[n]**
