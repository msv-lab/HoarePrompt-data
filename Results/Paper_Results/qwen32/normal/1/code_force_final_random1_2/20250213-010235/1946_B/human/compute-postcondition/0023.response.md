The code appends `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Given that `i` is `n-1`, `suf[i + 1]` is `suf[n]`.

Since `suf` is defined as `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `suf[n]` is the sum of all elements in `l`, i.e., `l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]`.

Therefore, `smin` will now include this new element.

Output State: **`suf` is a list `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., l[0] + l[1] + ... + l[n-1]]`, `smin` is a list `[0, min(suf[i + 1], 0), suf[n]]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`**.
