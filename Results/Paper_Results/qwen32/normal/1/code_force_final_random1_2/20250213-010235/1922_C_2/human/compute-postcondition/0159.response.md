To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the relevant parts of the code.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`: An integer such that \(n \geq 2\).
   - `i`: Initialized to 0.
   - `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `d1`: A `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0, updated based on the differences in the list `l`.
   - `d2`: A `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0, except `d2[n - 1]` which is 1, and other values calculated according to the loop logic.
   - `m`: An integer input from the user such that \(m \geq 1\).
   - `j`: Initialized to 1.
   - `x` and `y`: The last pair of integers read from the input. If `y` is greater than `x`, then `y > x`; otherwise, `y <= x`.

2. **Relevant Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(d1[y] - d1[x])
   ```

### Understanding `d1`:
- `d1` is a `defaultdict` where the default value for any key is 0.
- It is updated based on the differences in the list `l`. This means that for each difference between consecutive elements in `l`, the count of that difference is stored in `d1`.

### Key Points:
- The specific values of `x` and `y` are given as the last pair of integers read from the input.
- The comparison `if y > x` tells us the relationship between `y` and `x`, but it doesn't affect the calculation of `d1[y] - d1[x]`.

### Calculation:
- `d1[y]` represents the count of occurrences of the difference `y` in the list `l`.
- `d1[x]` represents the count of occurrences of the difference `x` in the list `l`.
- The expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` calculates the difference between these two counts.

### Output:
Given the above understanding, the output of the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement will be the difference between the number of times `y` appears as a difference in the list `l` and the number of times `x` appears as a difference in the list `l`.

Thus, the output can be described as:
Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] is the count of occurrences of y as a difference in the list l, and d1[x] is the count of occurrences of x as a difference in the list l)**
