Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(n \geq 2\), `i` is 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and updated values based on the differences in the list `l`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 except `d2[n - 1]` which is 1 and other values calculated according to the loop logic, `m` is an integer input from the user such that \(m \geq 1\), `j` is 1, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input. If `y` is greater than `x`, then `y` is indeed greater than `x`. Otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.**
