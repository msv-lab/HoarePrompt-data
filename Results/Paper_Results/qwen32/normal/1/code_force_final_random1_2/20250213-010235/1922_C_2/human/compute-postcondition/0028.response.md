To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop's header, which are `i`, `n`, and implicitly the list `l` (though it's not directly modified in the loop header).

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is n - 2
- `n` is greater than 2
- `l` is a list of integers
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 where `d1[2]` and subsequent entries are updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is 1. If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is set to 2. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is set to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.

Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one less than its current value (`n - 2`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop header.
- `i` is now `n - 3`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `l` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop header.
- `d1` and `d2` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop header.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is n - 3, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 where `d1[2]` and subsequent entries are updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is 1. If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is set to 2. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is set to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**
