### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Input Parsing:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city positions `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.

#### Closest City Calculation:
- The function `func_1` is intended to compute the cost to move to the closest city for each city.
- The function iterates through the cities and determines whether moving to the next city (`forward`) or the previous city (`back`) is cheaper.
- If moving to the next city is cheaper, it assigns `1` to `prog_cities[i]`; otherwise, it assigns the distance to the next city.

However, there are issues with this logic:
1. The function only checks the forward direction and assigns the forward distance if the forward city is not closer. It does not correctly handle the case where the previous city might be closer.
2. The function should compare the distances to both the previous and next cities and choose the smaller one. If the closest city is within 1 unit of distance, it should assign `1` to `prog_cities[i]`.

#### Prefix Sum Calculation:
- Two prefix sum arrays, `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`, are calculated:
  - `pref_sum_f` accumulates the costs when moving forward from city 1 to city `n`.
  - `pref_sum_b` accumulates the costs when moving backward from city `n` to city 1.
- `pref_sum_b` is reversed to align with the forward direction.

The prefix sum arrays are built based on the incorrect values from `func_1`, leading to incorrect cumulative costs.

#### Query Processing:
- For each query `(a, b)`:
  - If `a < b`, the program calculates the cost as the difference between `pref_sum_f[b - 1]` and `pref_sum_f[a - 1]`.
  - If `a > b`, the program calculates the cost as the difference between `pref_sum_b[b - 1]` and `pref_sum_b[a - 1]`.

Given the incorrect values in `prog_cities`, the prefix sums are also incorrect, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

#### Example Analysis:
Given the input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The program's output is:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
3
8
1
1
14
```

This discrepancy arises because the program does not correctly identify the closest city for each city and thus does not compute the correct cost for moving to the closest city.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in determining the closest city and calculating the prefix sums.

#### Annotations:
The annotations correctly describe the state of the program and the purpose of `func_1`. However, they do not highlight the critical flaw in the logic of `func_1`, which is essential for the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
