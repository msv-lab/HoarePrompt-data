The code snippet initializes a new defaultdict named `d2` with default integer values of 0. This does not affect the existing variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, or `d1`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0.**
