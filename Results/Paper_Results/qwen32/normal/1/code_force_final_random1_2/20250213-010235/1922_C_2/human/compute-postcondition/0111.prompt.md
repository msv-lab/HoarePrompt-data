Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 2; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 2 to `n` updated based on the conditions in the loop; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and values from `d2[1]` to `d2[n - 1]` updated based on the conditions in the loop; `m` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0; `j` is `m-1`; `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are input values for each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if y > x:
        print(d1[y] - d1[x])
    else:
        print(d2[y] - d2[x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 2 to `n` updated based on the conditions in the loop, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and values from `d2[1]` to `d2[n - 1]` updated based on the conditions in the loop, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input. If `y` is greater than `x`, the condition `y > x` holds. Otherwise, the condition `y <= x` holds.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 2 to `n` updated based on the conditions in the loop, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and values from `d2[1]` to `d2[n - 1]` updated based on the conditions in the loop, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m`, `x` and `y` are the two new integers read from the input. If `y` is greater than `x`, the condition `y > x` holds. Otherwise, the condition `y <= x` holds.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 2 to `n` updated based on the conditions in the loop, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and values from `d2[1]` to `d2[n - 1]` updated based on the conditions in the loop, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are the two new integers read from the input. If `y > x`, the condition `y > x` holds. Otherwise, the condition `y <= x` holds.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
