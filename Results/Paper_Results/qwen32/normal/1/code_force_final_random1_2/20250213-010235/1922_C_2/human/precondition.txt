t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case is represented as a tuple (n, a, m, queries) where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, a is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order (0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9), m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and queries is a list of m tuples, each containing two integers x_i and y_i (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n; x_i != y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost is to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
