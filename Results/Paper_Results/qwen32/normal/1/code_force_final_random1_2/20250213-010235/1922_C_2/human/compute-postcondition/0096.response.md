Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 2 to `n` updated based on the conditions in the loop, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and values from `d2[1]` to `d2[n - 1]` updated based on the conditions in the loop, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input, and `y` is greater than `x`.**
