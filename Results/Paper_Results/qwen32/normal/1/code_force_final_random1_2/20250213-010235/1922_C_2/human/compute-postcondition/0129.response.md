The given code snippet modifies the value of `d1[i + 2]` by setting it to `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Here's the breakdown of the changes:

- `d1` is a defaultdict with a default integer value of 0, and initially `d1[2]` is 1.
- `i` is defined as `m + 2`.

After executing the line `d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]`, the value of `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the value of `d1[i + 1]`. Since the exact value of `i` (and thus `i + 1` and `i + 2`) is not specified, we can only express the new state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `m + 2`, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d1[2]` is 1, `d1[i + 2]` is `1 + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input.**
