Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and an entry `{2: 1}`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 (and no specific entries), `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, and no further changes to `x` and `y` as they are input values for each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
        d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
    else:
        d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 (and no specific entries), `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, and no further changes to `x` and `y` as they are input values for each iteration. If the difference between `l[i+1]` and `l[i]` is less than the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i-1]`, then `d1` has entries `{2: 1, 3: 2}`. Otherwise, `d1` has entries `{2: 1, 3: l[2] - l[1] + 1}`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 (and no specific entries), `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, and no further changes to `x` and `y` as they are input values for each iteration. If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[4]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `d1[4]` is set to `l[3] - l[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 4, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[4]` is set to 1 if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, otherwise `d1[4]` is set to `l[3] - l[2]`. Additionally, `d1[5]` is set to `1 + d1[4]` if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, otherwise `d1[5]` is set to `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`. `d2` remains a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no specific entries. `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, and no further changes are made to `x` and `y` as they are input values for each iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
