The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is `m + 1`
- `n` is greater than 2
- `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[2]` is 1
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0
- `m` is greater than 0
- `j` is `m-1`
- `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input
- If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[m + 3]` is `1 + d1[m + 2]`. Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.

Since the loop iterates over the range `1` to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 and it should still be within the range `[1, n-1)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `m + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `m + 2`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `m + 2`, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input**.
