To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how the variables `d1`, `x`, and `y` are defined and updated.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `d1` is a `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0, where `d1[2]` and subsequent entries are updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`.
- `d2` is a `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0, and it is updated based on specific conditions in a loop.
- `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
- `x` and `y` are two integers read from the input.
- `j` is initialized to 1.

### Analysis of `d1`:
The `d1` dictionary is updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of the list `l`. Specifically, `d1[2]` and subsequent entries are updated based on these differences. However, the exact values of `d1` depend on the contents of `l`, which are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]`.

### Analysis of `x` and `y`:
The values of `x` and `y` are integers read from the input. Since their exact values are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]`.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of specific values for `l`, `x`, and `y`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables. The expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` will yield a result based on the values stored in `d1` at indices `y` and `x`, which are determined by the differences in the list `l`.

Thus, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1 is a defaultdict with values based on differences between consecutive elements of the list l, and x and y are integers read from the input)**
