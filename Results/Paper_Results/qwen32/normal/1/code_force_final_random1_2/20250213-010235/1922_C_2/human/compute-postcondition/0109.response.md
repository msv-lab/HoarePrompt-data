To determine what will be printed by the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the context of the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `i`: Initialized to 0.
   - `n`: Greater than 2.
   - `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `d1`: A `defaultdict` with keys from 2 to `n` updated based on conditions in the loop.
   - `d2`: A `defaultdict` with a default integer value of 0. Values from `d2[1]` to `d2[n - 1]` are updated based on conditions in the loop.
   - `m`: Greater than 0.
   - `j`: Set to `m-1`.
   - `x` and `y`: Two new integers read from the input. If `y > x`, the condition `y > x` holds; otherwise, the condition `y <= x` holds.

2. **The `print` statement:**
   - The statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` calculates the difference between the values stored in `d2` at indices `y` and `x`.

Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `d2` is a `defaultdict` initialized with default integer values of 0.
- The values in `d2` from `d2[1]` to `d2[n - 1]` are updated based on some conditions within the loop (which are not detailed here).
- `x` and `y` are integers read from the input, and `y > x` or `y <= x`.

Since the specific updates to `d2` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `d2[x]` and `d2[y]`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these values.

**Output Description:**
The `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement will print the difference between the values stored in `d2` at indices `y` and `x`. Since the exact values of `d2[x]` and `d2[y]` depend on the updates within the loop, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2 is a defaultdict with values updated based on the loop conditions, x and y are integers read from the input, and y > x or y <= x)**
