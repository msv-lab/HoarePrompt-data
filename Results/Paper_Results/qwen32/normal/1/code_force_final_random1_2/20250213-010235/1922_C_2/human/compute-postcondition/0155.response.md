To determine what will be printed by the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the logic involved:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`: An integer such that \(n \geq 2\).
- `i`: Initialized to 0.
- `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
- `d1`: A `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0, updated based on the differences in the list `l`.
- `d2`: A `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0, except `d2[n - 1]` which is 1. Other values are calculated according to the loop logic.
- `m`: An integer input from the user such that \(m \geq 1\).
- `j`: Initialized to 0.
- `x` and `y`: The last pair of integers read from the input, where `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

### Key Points:
- `d2` is initialized such that `d2[n - 1] = 1` and all other keys have a default value of 0.
- The values of `d2` are updated in a loop based on the differences in the list `l`.
- The final `print` statement computes the difference between `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.

### Analysis:
Given that `y` is less than or equal to `x`, we need to consider the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` after the loop updates.

#### Case 1: `y == n - 1`
- If `y == n - 1`, then `d2[y] = 1` because `d2[n - 1]` is explicitly set to 1.
- The value of `d2[x]` depends on the loop updates. If `x` was never encountered in a way that changed its value from the default, `d2[x] = 0`.

#### Case 2: `y < n - 1`
- If `y < n - 1`, the value of `d2[y]` depends on the loop updates. If `y` was never encountered in a way that changed its value from the default, `d2[y] = 0`.
- Similarly, the value of `d2[x]` depends on the loop updates. If `x` was never encountered in a way that changed its value from the default, `d2[x] = 0`.

In both cases, the key point is that `d2[n - 1]` is explicitly set to 1, and all other values are either 0 or updated based on the loop logic.

### Conclusion:
Without specific values for `x` and `y` and the exact loop logic, we can only provide a general description of the output. However, based on the given information, the most precise description is:

- If `y == n - 1`, `d2[y] = 1` and `d2[x]` could be 0 or any value updated by the loop.
- If `y < n - 1`, both `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` could be 0 or any value updated by the loop.

Thus, the output of `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` will depend on the specific values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` after the loop updates.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] and d2[x] are values in the defaultdict d2 updated based on the loop logic)**
