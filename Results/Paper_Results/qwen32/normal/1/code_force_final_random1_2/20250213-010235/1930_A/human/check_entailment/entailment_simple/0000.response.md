### Reasoning:

The goal of the problem is to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the smaller integer of each pair to the score. The strategy to achieve this is to sort the list of integers and then always pick the smallest available integer as part of each pair. This ensures that we are always adding the smallest possible value to the score, thereby maximizing the score.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Scoring**: The program iterates through the sorted list, picking every second element starting from the first (i.e., elements at indices 0, 2, 4, etc.). These elements represent the smallest values in each pair when paired with their subsequent elements in the sorted list.
4. **Output**: The score for each test case is printed.

By sorting the list and summing the elements at even indices, the program effectively pairs the smallest possible integers together, ensuring that the score is maximized.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: Input `1`, `2 3`
  - Sorted List: `[2, 3]`
  - Score: `2` (sum of elements at even indices)
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 2**: Input `2`, `1 1 2 1`
  - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
  - Score: `1 + 1` (sum of elements at even indices)
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 3**: Input `3`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Score: `1 + 1 + 1` (sum of elements at even indices)
  - Output: `3`

All test cases match the expected outputs, confirming that the program correctly implements the optimal strategy.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score by sorting the list and summing the elements at even indices. Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified.
