The code snippet adds the element at index `i` (which is `2*(n-1)`) of the list `l` to the variable `score`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged, while `score` is updated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `score` is `l[2*(n-1)]`, `i` is 2*(n-1)**.
