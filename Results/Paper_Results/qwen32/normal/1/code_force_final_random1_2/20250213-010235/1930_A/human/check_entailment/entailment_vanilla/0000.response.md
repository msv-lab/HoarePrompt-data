### Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. The strategy to achieve the maximum score is to always pair the smallest available numbers together. This ensures that we are consistently adding the smaller value of each pair to the score, which maximizes the total score.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the provided solution:

1. **Reading Input**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Pairing and Scoring**: The program iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first (i.e., indices 0, 2, 4, ...). These elements represent the minimum values of each pair when the list is sorted.
4. **Summing Scores**: It adds these selected elements to the score.
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

This approach works because sorting the list ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together, thus maximizing the sum of the minimums of the pairs.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

- **First Test Case**: `n = 1`, List = `[2, 3]`
  - Sorted List: `[2, 3]`
  - Score: `2` (minimum of `[2, 3]`)

- **Second Test Case**: `n = 2`, List = `[1, 1, 2, 1]`
  - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
  - Score: `1 + 1` (minimums of `[1, 1]` and `[1, 2]`)

- **Third Test Case**: `n = 3`, List = `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Score: `1 + 1 + 1` (minimums of `[1, 1]`, `[1, 1]`, and `[1, 1]`)

The program correctly computes the maximum score for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the optimal strategy to maximize the score by always pairing the smallest available numbers together. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
