### Reasoning:
To solve the problem, we need to maximize the score by choosing pairs of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. The optimal strategy involves pairing the smallest numbers together because the minimum of a pair will be larger if both numbers are smaller.

Here's how the provided program works:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers.
4. It sums up the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2) and prints this sum as the score for that test case.

By sorting the list and summing the elements at even indices, the program effectively pairs the smallest numbers together, which maximizes the score. This aligns with the optimal strategy described above.

### Correctness:
Given the problem constraints and the logic used in the program, the approach is correct. Therefore, the program will produce the maximum final score for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
