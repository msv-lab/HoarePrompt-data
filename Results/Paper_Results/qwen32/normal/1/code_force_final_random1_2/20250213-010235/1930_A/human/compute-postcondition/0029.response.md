The code snippet `score += l[i]` adds the value of the first element in the sorted list `l` (since `i` is 0) to the `score`. The initial value of `score` is 0, and after this operation, `score` will be equal to `l[0]`.

Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is `l[0]`, `i` is 0**.
