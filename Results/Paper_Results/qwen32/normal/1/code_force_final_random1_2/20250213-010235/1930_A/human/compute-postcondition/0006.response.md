To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Here's the given information:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `2 * n` with a step of 2.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0.

For the loop to execute another iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 2 (as per the loop's step value). Therefore, `i` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

The variable `n` does not change within the loop head; it remains constant throughout the loop iterations.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is `l[0]`, `i` is 2**
