The code snippet reads an input string, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, creates a list from these integers, sorts the list, and assigns it to the variable `l`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `n` is an input integer

After executing the code:
- `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input.**
