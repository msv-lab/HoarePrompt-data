The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads a new integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` but does not affect the values of `t`, `l`, or `score`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the newly input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `score` is the sum of elements at even indices of `l` (i.e., `l[0] + l[2] + l[4] + ... + l[2*(n-1)]`)**
