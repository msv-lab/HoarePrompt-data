To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how many times the loop will execute based on the value of `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `2 * n` with a step of 2. This means it will execute `n` times because the range function will generate `n` even numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) `2 * n`.

Given the pattern from the first three iterations, the `score` accumulates every second element from the list `l` starting from index 0. Therefore, after `n` iterations, the `score` will be the sum of the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2(n-1).

Let's summarize the final state:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it defines the number of iterations.
- `l` remains unchanged as it is only read from within the loop.
- `score` will be the sum of the elements at even indices from the list `l`.
- `i` will be the last value it took in the loop, which is `2 * (n - 1)`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `score` is the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2(n-1) from `l`, `i` is 2*(n-1).**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, the `score` will be the sum of every second element from the list `l` starting from the first element, and `i` will be the last even index that was processed, which is `2 * (n - 1)`.
