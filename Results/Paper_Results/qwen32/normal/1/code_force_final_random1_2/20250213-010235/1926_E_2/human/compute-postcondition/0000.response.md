Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to be the integer value of the input. The constraints on `t` remain the same, and the conditions for `n` and `k` for each test case are still valid as they were not affected by this line of code.
