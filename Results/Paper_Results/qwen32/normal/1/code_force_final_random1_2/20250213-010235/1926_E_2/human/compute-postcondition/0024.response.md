The code snippet `pow *= 2` multiplies the current value of `pow` by 2. Given the initial state where `pow` is 1, after executing the code, `pow` will be 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 10, `n` is 0, `k` is 3, `L` is a list with at least one element (e.g., `[4]`), `pow` is 2, `tot` is `tot + a`.**
