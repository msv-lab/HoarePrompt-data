To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition `p <= i - 1`.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4;
- `n` is 8;
- `k` is 7;
- `s` is 8;
- `i` is 4;
- `d` is 0;
- `p` is 3;
- `g` is 6;
- `h` is 2;
- `y` is 2;
- `f` is not defined.

The loop condition is `p <= i - 1`. Substituting the current values of `p` and `i`:

- `p` is 3
- `i` is 4
- `i - 1` is 3

Currently, `p` (which is 3) is equal to `i - 1` (which is also 3), so the condition `p <= i - 1` is true, and the loop can execute one more time.

Since the loop condition is already satisfied, no further adjustments are needed to ensure the loop can execute again. We simply repeat the program state as it is at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` is 8; `k` is 7; `s` is 8; `i` is 4; `d` is 0; `p` is 3; `g` is 6; `h` is 2; `y` is 2; `f` is not defined.**
