Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The program attempts to determine the sequence of cards by calculating the number of odd multiples at each step and storing these counts in a list `L`. However, it does not actually generate the sequence of cards as described in the problem.

2. The program then tries to find the k-th card by iterating through the counts stored in `L` and calculating the corresponding card value. However, the calculation `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` does not correctly map to the intended sequence of cards.

3. The logic for generating the sequence of cards should involve iterating over multiples of odd numbers and collecting these multiples in the correct order until all cards up to `n` are used.

Here's a corrected version of the program that implements the correct logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        result = []
        
        # Collect all odd numbers
        odd_numbers = [i for i in range(1, n + 1, 2)]
        result.extend(odd_numbers)
        
        # Collect multiples of odd numbers
        multiplier = 2
        while len(result) < n:
            multiples = [multiplier * i for i in odd_numbers if multiplier * i <= n]
            result.extend(multiples)
            multiplier += 1
        
        # Output the k-th card (1-based index)
        print(result[k - 1])

func()
```

This corrected version generates the sequence of cards according to the problem statement and correctly outputs the k-th card for each test case.
