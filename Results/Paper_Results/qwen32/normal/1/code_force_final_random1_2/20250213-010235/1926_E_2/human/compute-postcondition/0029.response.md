The code snippet provided multiplies the variable `pow` by 2. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `tot`, `a`) are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 10
- `n` is 0
- `k` is 3
- `L` is a list with at least two elements
- `pow` is 2
- `tot` is `tot + L[1]`
- `a` is the second element of `L`
- The conditions `if tot < k and k <= tot + a` remain as specified

After executing `pow *= 2`, the value of `pow` changes from 2 to 4. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is 10, `n` is 0, `k` is 3, `L` is a list with at least two elements, `pow` is 4, `tot` is `tot + L[1]`, `a` is the second element of `L`. If `tot < k and k <= tot + a`, the conditions remain as specified.**
