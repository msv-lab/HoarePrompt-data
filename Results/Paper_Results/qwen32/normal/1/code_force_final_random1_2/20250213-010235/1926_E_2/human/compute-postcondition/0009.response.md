The code snippet provided does not actually change the value of `m` since `m` is already defined as `(n + 1) // 2` in the Initial State. Therefore, the value of `m` remains the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is the second integer read from the input; `L` is `[m]`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
