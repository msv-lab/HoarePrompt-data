To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case based on the given conditions. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. Depending on whether `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, it follows different paths to compute and print the result.

Let's analyze the provided output states for the first three iterations:

1. **First Iteration**:
   - If `k > (n + 1) // 2`, it calculates `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, and `y`.
   - Otherwise, it directly prints `2 * k - 1`.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - Similar to the first iteration, it recalculates `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, and potentially `y` based on the new `n` and `k`.
   - The specific values depend on the input for this iteration.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - Again, it recalculates `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, and potentially `y` based on the new `n` and `k`.
   - The specific values depend on the input for this iteration.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the state variables (`s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, `y`) are reinitialized at the start of each iteration, the final output state will be determined by the last test case processed.

Therefore, the final output state will reflect the result of the last test case processed by the loop. Let's denote the values of `n` and `k` for the last test case as `n_last` and `k_last`.

- If `k_last > (n_last + 1) // 2`, the final output will be calculated as described in the loop logic, resulting in some value `y_last`.
- Otherwise, the final output will be `2 * k_last - 1`.

Since the exact values of `n_last` and `k_last` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the final output. However, we can describe the final state in terms of these variables.

### Final Output State Description:
- If `k_last > (n_last + 1) // 2`, the final output will be `y_last`, which is calculated through the loop logic.
- Otherwise, the final output will be `2 * k_last - 1`.

Thus, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **The output of the last test case processed by the loop, which is either `2 * k_last - 1` if `k_last <= (n_last + 1) // 2`, or `y_last` calculated through the loop logic if `k_last > (n_last + 1) // 2`.**
