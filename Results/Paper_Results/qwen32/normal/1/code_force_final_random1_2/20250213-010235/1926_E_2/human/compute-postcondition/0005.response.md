The code assigns the value `(n + 1) // 2` to the variable `m`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `L` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` is a non-zero integer read from the input; `k` is the second integer read from the input; `L` is an empty list; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
