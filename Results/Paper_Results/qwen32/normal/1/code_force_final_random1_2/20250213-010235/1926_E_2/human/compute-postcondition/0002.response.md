The code reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input; `k` is the second integer read from the input.**
