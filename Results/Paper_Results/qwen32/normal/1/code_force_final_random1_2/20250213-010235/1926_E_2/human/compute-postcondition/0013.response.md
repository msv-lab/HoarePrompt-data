The given code snippet reassigns the value of `m` using the expression `(n + 1) // 2`. However, the initial state already defines `m` as `(n + 1) // 2`. Since the value of `m` is being reassigned to the same expression it was initially defined with, the value of `m` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the reassignment operation does not alter the value of `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is the second integer read from the input; `L` is `[m, m]`; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
