The code snippet `tot += a` increments the value of `tot` by the value of `a`. Given the initial state, `tot` is initially `a_next` and `a` is also `a_next`. Therefore, after executing the code, `tot` will be `a_next + a_next`, which simplifies to `2 * a_next`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `pow`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 9, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 2, `tot` is `2 * a_next`, `a` is `a_next`.**
