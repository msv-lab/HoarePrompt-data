To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to continue the process described in the loop until the condition `p <= i - 1` is no longer satisfied. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the loop progresses:

- **Initial State:** 
  - `p = 1`
  - `g = 0`
  - `h = 8`

- **After 1st Iteration:**
  - `g += (h + 1) // 2` → `g = 0 + (8 + 1) // 2` → `g = 4`
  - `h -= (h + 1) // 2` → `h = 8 - (8 + 1) // 2` → `h = 4`
  - `p += 1` → `p = 2`

- **After 2nd Iteration:**
  - `g += (h + 1) // 2` → `g = 4 + (4 + 1) // 2` → `g = 6`
  - `h -= (h + 1) // 2` → `h = 4 - (4 + 1) // 2` → `h = 2`
  - `p += 1` → `p = 3`

- **After 3rd Iteration:**
  - `g += (h + 1) // 2` → `g = 6 + (2 + 1) // 2` → `g = 7`
  - `h -= (h + 1) // 2` → `h = 2 - (2 + 1) // 2` → `h = 1`
  - `p += 1` → `p = 4`

- **After 4th Iteration:**
  - `g += (h + 1) // 2` → `g = 7 + (1 + 1) // 2` → `g = 8`
  - `h -= (h + 1) // 2` → `h = 1 - (1 + 1) // 2` → `h = 0`
  - `p += 1` → `p = 5`

At this point, `p` is 5, which is not less than or equal to `i - 1` (which is 3), so the loop terminates.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; n is 8; k is 7; s is 8; i is 4; d is 0; p is 5; g is 8; h is 0; y is 2; f is not defined.**

In simple terms, after all iterations, the value of `p` becomes 5, `g` becomes 8, and `h` becomes 0, while all other variables remain unchanged.
