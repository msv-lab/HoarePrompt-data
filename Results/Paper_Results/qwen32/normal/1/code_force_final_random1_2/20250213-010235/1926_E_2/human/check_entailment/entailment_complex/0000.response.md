To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the described algorithm for determining the k-th card Vladislav lays down.

### Algorithm Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the total number of cards) and `k` (the position of the card to find).
   - It initializes an empty list `L` to store intermediate results.
   - It enters a loop where it repeatedly calculates `m`, which is half of `n` rounded up (`(n + 1) // 2`). This value represents the number of odd-numbered cards that can be placed in the current step.
   - It subtracts `m` from `n` and appends `m` to the list `L`.
   - This process continues until `n` becomes 0.
3. **Determining the k-th Card**:
   - It initializes `tot` to 0 and `pow` to 1.
   - It iterates over the list `L`, and for each element `a` in `L`, it checks if `k` falls within the current segment defined by `tot` and `tot + a`.
   - If `k` is within this segment, it calculates the k-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` and prints it.
   - It updates `tot` by adding `a` and multiplies `pow` by 2 for the next iteration.

### Verification Against Example:
Let's verify the program with the first few test cases from the example:

- **Test Case 1 (n=7, k=1)**:
  - `L` will be `[4, 2, 1]` after processing `n`.
  - Iterating through `L`:
    - `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `a` is 4. Since `1` is within `[0, 4]`, the card is `1 * (2 * (1 - 0) - 1) = 1`.
  - Output: `1`.

- **Test Case 2 (n=7, k=2)**:
  - `L` is still `[4, 2, 1]`.
  - Iterating through `L`:
    - `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `a` is 4. Since `2` is within `[0, 4]`, the card is `1 * (2 * (2 - 0) - 1) = 3`.
  - Output: `3`.

- **Test Case 3 (n=7, k=3)**:
  - `L` is still `[4, 2, 1]`.
  - Iterating through `L`:
    - `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `a` is 4. Since `3` is within `[0, 4]`, the card is `1 * (2 * (3 - 0) - 1) = 5`.
  - Output: `5`.

- **Test Case 4 (n=7, k=4)**:
  - `L` is still `[4, 2, 1]`.
  - Iterating through `L`:
    - `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `a` is 4. Since `4` is within `[0, 4]`, the card is `1 * (2 * (4 - 0) - 1) = 7`.
  - Output: `7`.

- **Test Case 5 (n=7, k=5)**:
  - `L` is still `[4, 2, 1]`.
  - Iterating through `L`:
    - `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `a` is 4. Since `5` is not within `[0, 4]`, move to the next segment.
    - `tot` is 4, `pow` is 2, `a` is 2. Since `5` is within `[4, 6]`, the card is `2 * (2 * (5 - 4) - 1) = 2`.
  - Output: `2`.

This matches the expected output for these test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the described algorithm and produces the correct outputs for the provided examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
