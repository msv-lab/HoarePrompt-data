The code snippet `pow *= 2` multiplies the current value of `pow` by 2. Given that the initial state specifies `pow` is 2, after executing this line, `pow` will be 4.

No other variables in the initial state are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same for all other variables.

Output State: **`t` is 9, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 4, `tot` is `2 * a_next`, `a` is `a_next`.**
