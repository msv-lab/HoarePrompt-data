To solve the problem, let's first understand the operation being performed on `h`.

Given:
- Initial value of `h` is 2.

The operation is:
```
h -= (h + 1) // 2
```

Breaking down the operation:
- `(h + 1)` evaluates to `2 + 1` which is `3`.
- `(h + 1) // 2` performs integer division of `3` by `2`, resulting in `1`.
- `h -= 1` means `h` is updated to `h - 1`, so `h` becomes `2 - 1` which is `1`.

Therefore, the new value of `h` is `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` is 8; `k` is 7; `s` is 8; `i` is 4; `d` is 0; `p` is 3; `g` is 7; `h` is 1; `y` is 2; `f` is not defined.**
