Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is 9
- `n` is 0
- `k` is an input integer (its exact value is not specified)
- `L` is a list with at least one element (the specific elements are not provided)
- `pow` is 1
- `tot` is 0
- `tot` is less than `k` while `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a` (note that `a` is not defined in the initial state, but it seems to be related to elements in the list `L`)

### Print Statement:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables Involved**:
   - `pow`: This is explicitly given as 1.
   - `k`: This is an input integer, so its value is not fixed and depends on the input.
   - `tot`: This is explicitly given as 0.

2. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - Since `pow` is 1, the expression simplifies to `(2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - Given that `tot` is 0, the expression further simplifies to `(2 * k - 1)`.

### Final Expression:
The final expression to be evaluated is `2 * k - 1`.

### Output:
Since `k` is an input integer, the exact value of `k` is not provided. Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `k`. However, based on the given information, we can express the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is the input integer)**
