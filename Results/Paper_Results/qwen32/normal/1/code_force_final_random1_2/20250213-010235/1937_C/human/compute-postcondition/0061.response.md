To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) where the response was `<`, or 1 if no such response was received.
- `best` is initialized to 0.
- `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so it is unclear from the given information what its value is. However, since it is used in the print statement, we need to assume it has been defined somewhere in the preceding code.

Given this information, let's break down the `print` statement:

```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) where the response was `<`, or 1 if no such response was received.
- `best` is explicitly set to 0.
- `k` is repeated.
- `i` is an undefined variable in the initial state, but it must have a value for the print statement to execute correctly.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe it as `i`.

Putting it all together, the output will be:

Output: **? [k] 0 [k] [i] (where k is the largest index i from 2 to n-1 where the response was '<', or 1 if no such response was received, and i is the value of i)**
