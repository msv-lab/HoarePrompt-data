To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
2. `n` must be greater than 2.
3. `k` is set to 1.
4. `best` is the last index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the response was `'<'`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement outputs a formatted string with several values.
- The values being printed are:
  - `'?'`: This is a literal string.
  - `0`: This is a literal integer.
  - `k`: According to the initial state, `k` is 1.
  - `0`: This is another literal integer.
  - `i`: The variable `i` is used here, but it is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not defined, it would typically raise a `NameError` if this code were executed without `i` being defined elsewhere in the code. However, since the task is to determine what will be printed based on the given information, we'll assume `i` is intended to be used as per the context of the problem. Given the context, `i` should be the `best` index as per the initial state description.

### Conclusion:
Based on the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be:
- `'?'`: The literal string.
- `0`: The literal integer.
- `k`: Which is 1.
- `0`: Another literal integer.
- `i`: Assuming `i` is meant to be `best`, we describe it as the last index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the response was `'<'`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 1 0 best (where best is the last index i from 1 to n-1 where the response was '<')**
