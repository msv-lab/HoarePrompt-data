To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `res` is the new input string.
- `i` is `i + 2`.
- If `res` is `'<'`, then `k` is set to `i` and `best` is updated to `i`. Otherwise, `k` remains 1 and `best` retains its previous value.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- The first argument is a literal string `'?'`.
- The second argument is a literal integer `0`.
- The third argument is `k`.
- The fourth argument is a literal integer `0`.
- The fifth argument is `i`.

### Determining Values of `k` and `i`:
- `i` is described as `i + 2`. This means that `i` has been incremented by 2 from its previous value.
- `k` depends on the value of `res`:
  - If `res` is `'<'`, `k` is set to `i`.
  - Otherwise, `k` remains 1.

### Output Description:
Given the above analysis, the output will be:
- `'?'` (a literal string).
- `0` (a literal integer).
- `k` (which is either `i` if `res` is `'<'` or `1` otherwise).
- `0` (a literal integer).
- `i` (the current value of `i` after being incremented by 2).

Thus, the output can be described as:
Output: **? 0 k 0 i (where k is i if res is '<', otherwise k is 1, and i is the current value of i after being incremented by 2)**
