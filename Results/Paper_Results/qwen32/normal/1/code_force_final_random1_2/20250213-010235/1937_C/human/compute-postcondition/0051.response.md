The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `k`. This means that the value of `k` is now updated to whatever the current value of `i` is. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `i`, `best` is the last index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the response was `'<'`, `res` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`**.
