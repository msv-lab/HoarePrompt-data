Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the value of `t` converted from input(), `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) where the response was `'<'`, `best` is `i` if `res` is `'<'` and `i` is greater than the current `k`, otherwise `best` remains unchanged, `res` is the value of the user input, `i` is incremented by 1**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `res` is updated to the value of the user input. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `best`, and `i`) remain unchanged except that `i` is incremented by 1.
