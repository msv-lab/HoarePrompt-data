In the given task, the loop head only contains the underscore `_` and the `range(int(input()))` part. This means that the only variable directly influenced by the loop header is the implicit loop counter, which is represented by `_` and does not affect the state as it is not used within the loop body. The loop will iterate based on the number of times specified by `int(input())`.

However, since the loop variable `_` is not relevant to the state described, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the state description that might be affected by the loop's execution context, even though they are not directly part of the loop header.

Given the state description:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `n` is the value of `t` converted from `input()`
- `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) where the response was `'<'`, or 1 if no such index exists
- `best` is the last index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the response was `'<'`

None of these variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `best`) are directly modified by the loop header itself. The loop header simply dictates how many times the loop will run based on the input value.

Since the task specifies that we should only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head does not contain any variables that can be directly modified, the state remains unchanged in terms of the loop head's influence.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same as described:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the value of `t` converted from input(), `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) where the response was `'<'`, or 1 if no such index exists, `best` is the last index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the response was `'<'`**
