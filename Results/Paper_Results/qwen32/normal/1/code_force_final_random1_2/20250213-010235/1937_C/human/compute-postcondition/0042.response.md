To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

The given for loop is:
```python
for i in range(2, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For this loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. The `range(2, n)` must produce at least one value for `i`.
2. This means `n` must be greater than 2 because `range(2, n)` will only produce values if `n > 2`.

The other variables mentioned (`t`, `k`, `best`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is 1, `best` is the last index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the response was `'<'`**
