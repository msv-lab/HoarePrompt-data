The code snippet `res = input()` assigns the value of the user input to the variable `res`. This means that the value of `res` changes from its previous state (which was either '<' or some other string) to whatever the user inputs.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `best`, and `i`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `res` is the new input string, and if the new `res` is '<', then `best` is updated to the current index `i` (from 2 to n-1). Otherwise, `best` remains 0. `i` is incremented by 1.**
