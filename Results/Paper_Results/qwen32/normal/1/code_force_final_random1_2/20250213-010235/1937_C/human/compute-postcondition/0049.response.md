To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n`: An integer greater than 2.
   - `k`: This variable is set to `i` if `res` is `'<'`; otherwise, it remains 1.
   - `best`: The last index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the response `res` was `'<'`.
   - `res`: An input string (not explicitly defined what it contains, but it influences `k`).
   - `i`: An integer that increments by 1 (`i = i + 1`).

2. **Understanding the Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)`.
   - It prints a literal question mark `'?'`, followed by the values of `0`, `k`, `0`, and `i`.

3. **Determining the Values:**
   - The first and third arguments are both `0`, so these are straightforward.
   - `k` depends on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is `'<'`, then `k` is set to the current value of `i`.
     - Otherwise, `k` remains `1`.
   - `i` is an integer that is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

Given the above, the exact value of `k` cannot be determined without knowing the value of `res` at the point of execution. However, we can describe the output in terms of the current state of `k` and `i`.

**Output Description:**
- The output starts with a literal `'?'`.
- Followed by `0`.
- Then the value of `k`, which is either `i` if `res` is `'<'` or `1` otherwise.
- Another `0`.
- Finally, the current value of `i`.

Thus, the precise output can be described as:

Output: **? 0 [k] 0 [i] (where k is i if res is '<', otherwise k is 1, and i is the current value of i)**
