To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Here's the given for loop:
```python
for i in range(2, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The `range(2, n)` function generates numbers starting from 2 up to (but not including) `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 2 because if `n` is 2 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` is the value of `t` converted from input().
- `k` is 1.

Since `k` is not part of the loop head, we don't need to adjust it. The only variables we need to consider are `i` and `n`.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 2. The variable `i` does not need to be set before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function inside the loop.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is 1**
