The value of `k` is updated to the current value of `i`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `best`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is at least 3, `k` is `i`, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the response was '<', or 0 if no such response was received, `res` is the input string, `i` is incremented by 1.**
