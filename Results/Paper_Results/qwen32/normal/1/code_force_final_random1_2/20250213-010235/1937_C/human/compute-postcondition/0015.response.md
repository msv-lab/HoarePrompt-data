To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step-by-step.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`n` is greater than 2**: This tells us that `n` is an integer with a value of at least 3. However, the specific value of `n` is not directly used in the print statement.
2. **`i` is `i + 1`**: This indicates that `i` is being incremented by 1. However, the initial value of `i` is not specified, so we can only say that it will be one more than whatever its previous value was.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

- `'?'`: This is a literal string character.
- `0`: This is a literal integer.
- `k`: This variable is not defined in the initial state, so we don't know its value. We'll represent it as `k`.
- `0`: This is another literal integer.
- `i`: This variable is mentioned in the initial state as being incremented by 1. Since we don't know the initial value of `i`, we'll represent it as `i + 1`.

### Final Output Description:
Given the above analysis, the print statement will output the following sequence of values:
- The literal string `'?'`
- The literal integer `0`
- The variable `k` (whose value is unknown)
- The literal integer `0`
- The incremented value of `i` (which is `i + 1`)

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 0 k 0 i+1 (where k is the value of k and i+1 is the incremented value of i)**
