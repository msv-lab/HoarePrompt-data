The code snippet `best = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `best`. Given the initial state, `best` was initially 0. After the assignment, `best` now holds the value of `i`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the largest index i (from 2 to n-1) where the response was '<', or 1 if no such response was received, `best` is `i`, `res` is the input string, and `res` equals '<'.**
