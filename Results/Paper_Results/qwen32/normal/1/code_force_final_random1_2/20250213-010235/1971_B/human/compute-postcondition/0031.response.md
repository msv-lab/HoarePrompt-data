Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is a newly input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a set containing unique characters from the newly input `s`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'YES'`. None of the variables `t`, `s`, `n`, `a`, or `i` are used within this particular `print` statement. Therefore, the output does not depend on the values of these variables.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
