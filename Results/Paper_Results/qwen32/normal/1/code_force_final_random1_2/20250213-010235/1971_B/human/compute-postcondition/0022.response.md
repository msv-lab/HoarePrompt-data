The code snippet sorts the string `s` in reverse alphabetical order and assigns the result to the variable `c`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `a`, `i`, or `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the newly input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the newly input `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `b` is the string `s` sorted in alphabetical order, `c` is the string `s` sorted in reverse alphabetical order.**
