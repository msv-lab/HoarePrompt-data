The code snippet sorts the characters in the string `s` and assigns the sorted string to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `i` which is incremented by 1.

Given that `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, sorting `s` will result in a new string `b` where the characters are in alphabetical order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the newly input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the newly input `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `b` is the sorted version of `s`.**
