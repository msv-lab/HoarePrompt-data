The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase English letters. For each string, it checks if the string contains exactly two unique characters. If it does, it outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it outputs 'YES' and then prints the lexicographically smallest or largest version of the string, depending on whether the original string is already in lexicographically smallest order.
