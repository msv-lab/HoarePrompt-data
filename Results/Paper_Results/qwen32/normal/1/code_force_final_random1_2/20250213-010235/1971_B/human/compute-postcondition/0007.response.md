Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is a newly input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`.
- The number of unique characters in `a` is not equal to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The variables `t`, `s`, `n`, and `a` are described in the initial state but are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their specific values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
