The code appends the value of `missing` to the `results` list. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `freq`, and `missing` remain unchanged except for `results`, which now includes the newly appended `missing` value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, an integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `results` is a list containing the value of `missing`; `n` is the first element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`; `m` is the second element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`; `a` is the third element of the _th tuple in `test_cases`; `freq` is a list of 7 integers representing the frequency of characters 'A' to 'G' in the string `a`; `missing` is the sum of max(0, m - f) for each f in freq.**
