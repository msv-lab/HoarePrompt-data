Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, an integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 5, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `results` is a list containing the value of `missing` for each test case in `test_cases`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains the same as it was initially, representing the total number of test cases. The `test_cases` list also remains unchanged, still holding the tuples of `(n, m, a)` for each test case. The `results` list now contains the computed `missing` value for each of the `t` test cases, where `missing` is the sum of the maximum differences between `m` and the frequency of each character ('A' to 'G') in the corresponding string `a`.
