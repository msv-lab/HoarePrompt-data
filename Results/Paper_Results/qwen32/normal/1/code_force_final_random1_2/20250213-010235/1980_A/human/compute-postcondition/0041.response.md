Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `test_cases` containing `t` tuples. Each tuple consists of an integer `n`, an integer `m`, and a string `a` of length `n` with characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function calculates and returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case to ensure that each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') appears at least `m` times.**
