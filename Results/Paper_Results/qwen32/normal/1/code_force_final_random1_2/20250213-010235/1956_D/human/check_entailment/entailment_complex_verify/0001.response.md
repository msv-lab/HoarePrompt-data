### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- We have an array `a` of length `n`.
- We can perform an operation up to `5*10^5` times.
- The operation involves selecting a subarray from index `l` to `r`, computing the MEX (minimum non-negative integer not present in the subarray), and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the array and provide a sequence of operations achieving this sum.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **func_1(a, l, r, ops)**:
   - This function is intended to recursively process the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if the element at `l` is not `0`. If not, it sets it to `0` and records the operation. This logic is flawed because setting an element to `0` is not necessarily optimal for maximizing the sum.
   - Otherwise, it recursively processes the subarray from `l+1` to `r`.
   - After the recursive call, it checks if the element at `l` is not equal to `r-l+1`. If not, it sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r-l+1` and records the operation. This logic attempts to set the subarray to the MEX value but is incorrect because `r-l+1` is not the MEX of the subarray.

2. **func_2(a)**:
   - This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n-1)`.
   - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - However, `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, leading to a `NameError`.

3. **recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)**:
   - This function calculates the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - If the sum is less than or equal to `(r-l+1)*(r-l+1)`, it calls `func_1` and then sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r-l+1`. This logic is incorrect because `r-l+1` is not the MEX of the subarray.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and splits the subarray around this maximum element, recursively processing the left and right parts. This logic is also flawed because splitting around the maximum element does not necessarily align with maximizing the sum using MEX operations.

4. **func_3()**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.
   - Since `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum` have issues, this function will not produce the correct output.

#### Annotations:

The annotations describe the state of the program at key points but do not address the logical flaws in the code. Specifically:
- The annotations indicate that `func_1` sets elements to `r-l+1` if they are not already equal, but this is not the MEX of the subarray.
- The annotations also indicate that `recursive_maximize_sum` splits around the maximum element, but this does not align with the goal of maximizing the sum using MEX operations.

#### Conclusion:

The code has several issues:
- Missing parameter passing (`ops` list).
- Incorrect logic for setting subarrays to MEX values.
- Incorrect logic for splitting subarrays around the maximum element.
- Lack of proper handling of the MEX computation.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
Final: **False**
