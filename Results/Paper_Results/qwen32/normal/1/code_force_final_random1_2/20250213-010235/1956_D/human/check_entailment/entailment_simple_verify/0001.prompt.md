You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We have an array `a` of length `n`.
- We can perform an operation up to `5*10^5` times.
- The operation involves selecting a subarray from index `l` to `r`, computing the MEX (minimum non-negative integer not present in the subarray), and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the array and provide a sequence of operations achieving this sum.

### Code Analysis:
1. **func_1(a, l, r, ops)**:
   - This function seems to recursively process the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if the element at `l` is not `0`. If not, it sets it to `0` and records the operation.
   - Otherwise, it recursively processes the subarray from `l+1` to `r`.
   - After the recursive call, it checks if the element at `l` is not equal to `r-l+1`. If not, it sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r-l+1` and records the operation.
   - This part of the code seems to aim at setting the subarray to the MEX value but has some logical issues.

2. **func_2(a)**:
   - This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n-1)`.
   - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - However, `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, which will cause a `NameError`.

3. **recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)**:
   - This function calculates the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - If the sum is less than or equal to `(r-l+1)*(r-l+1)`, it calls `func_1` and then sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r-l+1`.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and splits the subarray around this maximum element, recursively processing the left and right parts.
   - There are several issues here:
     - `func_1` is called without passing the `ops` list.
     - The logic for splitting around the maximum element is not clearly aligned with maximizing the sum using MEX operations.

4. **func_3()**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.
   - Since `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum` have issues, this function will not produce the correct output.

### Conclusion:
The code has several issues:
- Missing parameter passing (`ops` list).
- Incorrect logic for setting subarrays to MEX values.
- Incorrect logic for splitting subarrays around the maximum element.
- Lack of proper handling of the MEX computation.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly solve the problem as described.
