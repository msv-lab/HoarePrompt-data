Correctness: **False**

The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Undefined Variables**: The variable `a` is used in `recursive_maximize_sum` without being passed as an argument. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect Function Calls**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called inside `func_2` but is not defined within its scope. Instead, `func_1` is defined but never used in the way intended.

3. **Logic Errors**: The logic for determining when to apply the MEX operation and how to update the array is flawed. The function `func_1` attempts to set elements to 0 when they are not already, which is not the correct approach to maximize the sum using the MEX operation.

4. **Operations List**: The `ops` list is not properly managed across different function calls. It needs to be passed consistently through the recursive calls to keep track of all operations performed.

5. **Output Formatting**: The output format for the operations is incorrect. The indices should be 1-based, but the current implementation does not adjust for this.

To fix these issues, a proper implementation would involve correctly calculating the MEX for each segment of the array and applying the operation to maximize the sum while keeping track of the operations performed. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def mex(arr):
    s = set(arr)
    i = 0
    while i in s:
        i += 1
    return i

def maximize_sum(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []
    
    def apply_mex(l, r):
        segment = a[l:r+1]
        x = mex(segment)
        if x > max(segment):
            ops.append((l, r))
            for i in range(l, r+1):
                a[i] = x
    
    # Try to maximize the sum by applying MEX operations
    for l in range(n):
        for r in range(l, n):
            apply_mex(l, r)
    
    return sum(a), len(ops), ops

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    s, m, ops = maximize_sum(a)
    print(s, m)
    for l, r in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version calculates the MEX for every possible subarray and applies the operation if it increases the maximum value in that subarray, thus potentially increasing the overall sum. The operations are tracked and printed in the required format.
