The only objects in the loop head are the tuple `(l, r)` from the list `ops`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state related to `ops` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple `(l, r)`, after the previous iteration, the current tuple `(l, r)` has already been processed. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another tuple `(l, r)` in the list `ops`.

Let's assume that after processing the current tuple `(l, r)`, there is still at least one more tuple in `ops`. This means `ops` should now contain at least two tuples, and the next tuple `(l, r)` should be the new one to be processed.

State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is the integer value provided by the input, `s` is the first return value of `func_2`, `m` is the second return value of `func_2`, `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples, and the next tuple `(l, r)` is the one to be processed**.
