### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its functions to see if they collectively solve the problem as described.

#### Function Analysis:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is supposed to modify the array `a` by setting certain subarrays to a specific value based on conditions and record these modifications in the list `ops`.
   - However, there is a critical issue: `func_1` is called recursively but does not pass the `ops` list correctly to the recursive calls. This means that the operations recorded in `ops` will not be updated properly across recursive calls.
   - Additionally, the base case for recursion seems incorrect. It checks if `a[l] != 0` and sets it to `0`, but this does not align with the goal of maximizing the sum of the array.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum`.
   - However, `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, which means that the operations performed will not be recorded.
   - The function returns the sum of the array, the length of the operations list, and the operations list itself. Given the issues in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum`, the operations list will be empty.

3. **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**:
   - This function is intended to modify the array `a` by potentially replacing elements within a specified range `[l, r]` with a uniform value if a certain condition is met.
   - The condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is checked, and if true, the subarray is modified to have all elements equal to `r - l + 1`.
   - If the condition is false, the function recursively processes sublists around the maximum element in the current sublist.
   - However, the `ops` list is not passed as an argument to this function, so no operations are recorded.

4. **Function 4 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results.
   - Given the issues in `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum`, the operations list will be empty, and the printed operations will not reflect any changes made to the array.

### Conclusion:

The provided code has several issues:
- The `ops` list is not properly managed across recursive calls.
- The logic for modifying the array to maximize the sum is not correctly implemented.
- The operations list is not populated, leading to incorrect output.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**False**
