To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:** It is either equal to the length of list `a` or not.
2. **Lists `a` and `b`:** These are lists of elements.
3. **List `new`:** This list is created only if `i` equals the length of `a`. Each element `new[j]` is the minimum of `a[j]` and `b[j]` for all `j` from `0` to `len(a) - 1`.
4. **List `new2`:** This list is also created only if `i` equals the length of `a`. Each element `new2[j]` is the maximum of `a[j]` and `b[j]` for all `j` from `0` to `len(a) - 1`.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
```
- This line of code joins the elements of the list `new` into a single string, where each element is converted to a string first.

### Conditions:
- If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new` is constructed as described above.
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the list `new` is not created, and the code would raise a `NameError` because `new` is referenced but not defined.

### Output Determination:
- Since the problem specifies the initial state such that `i` is either equal to the length of `a` or not, and the code snippet assumes `new` exists, we infer that `i` must be equal to the length of `a` for the code to run without errors.
- Therefore, `new` is a list where each element is the minimum of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`.
- The `print` statement will output these elements joined into a single string.

### Final Output:
Given that `new` contains the minimum values of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`, the output will be a string representation of these minimum values concatenated together.

Output: **a string of concatenated minimum values from corresponding elements of `a` and `b`** (where `new[j] = min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from `0` to `len(a) - 1`)
