The code reads an input, converts it into a list of integers, and assigns this list to the variable `b`. The variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, and `a` is a list containing the individual digits of `t` as integers; `b` is a list containing the individual digits of the input as integers.**
