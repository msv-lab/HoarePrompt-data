To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code execution:

### Initial State:
- `i` is either equal to the length of `a` or not.
- If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, then:
  - `a` and `b` are lists of elements.
  - `new[j]` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from `0` to `len(a) - 1`.
  - `new2[j]` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from `0` to `len(a) - 1`.
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the else part does not execute, and the state of `a`, `b`, `new`, and `new2` remains unchanged.

### Code Execution:
The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
```

This line of code converts each element in the list `new2` to a string and joins them together into a single string without any separators.

### Analysis:
- If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new2` is constructed such that `new2[j]` is the maximum of `a[j]` and `b[j]` for all `j` from `0` to `len(a) - 1`.
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the state of `new2` remains unchanged from whatever it was before this condition check.

Given that the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `i` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Output Description:
- If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, the output will be a concatenated string of the maximum values of corresponding elements from `a` and `b`.
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the output will be the current state of `new2` converted to a string.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `i` are not provided, the most precise description we can give is based on the conditions described.

Output: **''.join(str(x) for x in new2) (where new2[j] is max(a[j], b[j]) for all j from 0 to len(a) - 1 if i equals the length of a, otherwise new2 remains unchanged)**
