To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `i < len(a)`
2. `a[i] == b[i]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `i` is 1.
- `b` is a non-empty list of integers where `b[0]` equals `a[0]`.
- `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` is `a[0]`.
- `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` is `a[0]`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to verify and possibly adjust the values of `i`, `a`, and `b`:

1. **Condition `i < len(a)`**: Since `i` is currently 1, this condition will be true as long as `a` has at least two elements (because `len(a)` would be at least 2).

2. **Condition `a[i] == b[i]`**: Since `i` is 1, this condition requires that `a[1]` equals `b[1]`.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to ensure:
- `a` has at least two elements.
- `b` has at least two elements.
- `a[1]` equals `b[1]`.

No other states need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 1, `b` is a non-empty list of integers with at least two elements where `b[0]` equals `a[0]` and `b[1]` equals `a[1]`, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` is `a[0]`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` is `a[0]`**
