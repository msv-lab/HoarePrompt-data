Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `b` is a list of integers identical to `a`, `new` is a list of integers where `new[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`, `new2` is a list of integers where `new2[i]` is `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `new[i]` is updated to be the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Since `b` is identical to `a`, `min(a[i], b[i])` is simply `a[i]`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `new2` remain unchanged.
