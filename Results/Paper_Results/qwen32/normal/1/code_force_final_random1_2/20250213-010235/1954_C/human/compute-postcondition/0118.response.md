To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided information.

### Loop Behavior Recap:
1. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each iteration, two lists `a` and `b` are read as input.
3. The code compares corresponding elements of `a` and `b`:
   - If `a[i] == b[i]`, it sets `new[i]` to `max(a[i], b[i])` and `new2[i]` to `min(a[i], b[i])`.
   - If `a[i] != b[i]`, it sets `new[i]` to `max(a[i], b[i])` and `new2[i]` to `min(a[i], b[i])`, and for the remaining elements, it sets `new[j]` to `min(a[j], b[j])` and `new2[j]` to `max(a[j], b[j])`.
4. Finally, it prints `new` and `new2` as strings.

### Given Output States:
- After 1 iteration: The lists `new` and `new2` are either identical to `a` and `b` (if `a` and `b` are identical) or reflect the comparison results.
- After 2 iterations: Similar to the first iteration, but for a different pair of `a` and `b`.
- After 3 iterations: The lists `new` and `new2` are identical to `a` and `b` (implying `a` and `b` were identical).

### Generalization:
Since the loop runs `t` times and each iteration processes a different pair of `a` and `b`, the final output state will be determined by the last iteration's inputs. The state of `a`, `b`, `new`, and `new2` after the last iteration will be the final output state.

### Final Output State:
- After `t` iterations, the final `new` and `new2` will be determined by the last pair of `a` and `b` processed.
- If the last `a` and `b` are identical, `new` and `new2` will be identical to `a` and `b`.
- If the last `a` and `b` are different, `new` and `new2` will reflect the comparison results.

### Conclusion:
The final output state depends on the last pair of `a` and `b` processed in the loop. However, since the problem specifies the state after the first three iterations and implies that `a` and `b` were identical in the third iteration, we can infer that the final state will be similar if the last pair is also identical.

Output State: **The final `new` and `new2` lists are identical to the last `a` and `b` lists processed in the loop.**
