The code assigns `new2[i]` the value of `min(a[i], b[i])`. The previous values of `a`, `i`, and `new[i]` remain unchanged. The only new assignment is to `new2[i]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list, `i` is an integer such that the current value of `i` is not equal to the length of `a`; `new[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`; `new2[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`.**
