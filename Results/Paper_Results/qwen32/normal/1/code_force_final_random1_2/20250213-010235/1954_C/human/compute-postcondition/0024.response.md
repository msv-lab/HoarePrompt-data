Output State: **`i` is 0; `a` is a list of elements; `b` is a list of elements; `new[i-1]` is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`; `new2[i-1]` is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`; `new[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `i` remains 0. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The values of `new[i-1]` and `new2[i-1]` remain as `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])` and `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])` respectively. The new value of `new[i]` is set to `min(a[i], b[i])`.
