The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 2, so after the operation `i += 1`, `i` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a list containing the individual digits of `t` as integers with length greater than 2, `b` is a list where `b[0]` is equal to `a[0]`, `b[1]` is equal to `a[1]`, and `b[2]` is equal to `a[2]`, `new` is a list of length equal to `a` with `new[0]` set to `a[0]`, `new[1]` set to `max(a[1], b[1])`, and `new[2]` set to `a[2]`, `new2` is a list of length equal to `a` with `new2[0]` set to `a[0]` and `new2[1]` set to `min(a[1], b[1])` and `new2[2]` set to `a[2]`, `i` is 3**.
