To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions:

1. The loop continues as long as `i < len(a)` and `a[i] == b[i]`.
2. During each iteration, it sets `new[i]` to `max(a[i], b[i])` and `new2[i]` to `min(a[i], b[i])`, and then increments `i`.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue until it finds an index `i` where `a[i] != b[i]` or `i` reaches the length of `a`.

### Final Output State Analysis:
- The loop will stop when either `i` reaches the length of `a` or `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`.
- For each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`, `new[i]` will be set to `a[i]` (since `max(a[i], b[i])` is `a[i]` when they are equal), and `new2[i]` will also be set to `a[i]` (since `min(a[i], b[i])` is `a[i]` when they are equal).

Thus, the final state will be:
- `new` will have the values of `a` up to the point where `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]` or up to the end of the list if all elements are equal.
- `new2` will also have the values of `a` up to the point where `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]` or up to the end of the list if all elements are equal.
- `i` will be the index where the loop stopped, which is either the length of `a` if all elements are equal, or the first index where `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`.

### Conclusion:
If all elements of `a` and `b` are equal, `i` will be equal to `len(a)`, and both `new` and `new2` will be identical to `a`. If there is a mismatch at any point, `i` will be the index of that mismatch, and `new` and `new2` will contain the values up to that point.

Since the problem does not specify a mismatch, we assume the worst case where all elements are equal.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(a)`, `b` is a list of integers identical to `a`, `new` is a list of integers identical to `a`, `new2` is a list of integers identical to `a`.**

In simple terms: The loop runs until it checks all elements of `a` and `b`, and since all elements are equal, `i` becomes the length of `a`, and both `new` and `new2` become identical to `a`.
