Output State: **`a` is a list with length greater than 1, `i` is 1, `new[0]` is `min(a[0], b[0])`, `new2[0]` is `max(a[0], b[0])`, `new[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`**

This means that the list `a` remains unchanged, `i` remains 1, `new[0]` and `new2[0]` retain their initial values, and `new[1]` is now assigned the value of `min(a[1], b[1])`.
