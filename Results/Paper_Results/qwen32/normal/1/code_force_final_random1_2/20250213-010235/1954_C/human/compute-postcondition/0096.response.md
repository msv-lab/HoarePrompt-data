The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was 2, so now `i` is 3. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `new`, `new2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is 3, `b` is a non-empty list of integers with at least three elements where `b[0]` equals `a[0]`, `b[1]` equals `a[1]`, and `b[2]` equals `a[2]`, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` is `a[0]`, `new[1]` is `a[1]`, and `new[2]` is `max(a[2], b[2])`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` is `a[0]`, `new2[1]` is `a[1]`, and `new2[2]` is `a[2]`.**
