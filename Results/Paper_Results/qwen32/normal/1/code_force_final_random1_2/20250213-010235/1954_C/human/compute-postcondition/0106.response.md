To determine how to adjust the state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `i < len(a)`.

Given:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `i` is `len(a)`.
- `b` is a list of integers identical to `a`.
- `new` is a list of integers where `new[i]` is `a[i]`.
- `new2` is a list of integers where `new2[i]` is `a[i]`.

The loop condition `i < len(a)` checks if `i` is less than the length of list `a`. Since `i` is currently set to `len(a)`, the condition `i < len(a)` evaluates to `False`, and the loop does not execute.

To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` so that `i < len(a)` becomes `True`. The simplest way to do this is to decrement `i` by 1.

Therefore, the state should be modified as follows:
State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `b` is a list of integers identical to `a`, `new` is a list of integers where `new[i]` is `a[i]`, `new2` is a list of integers where `new2[i]` is `a[i]`**. 

This adjustment ensures that `i < len(a)` is `True`, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
