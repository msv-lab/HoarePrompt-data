The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `i` was 2, so now `i` is 3. All other variables (`a`, `new[0]`, `new2[0]`, `new[1]`, `new2[1]`, `new[2]`, `new2[2]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list with length greater than 2, `i` is 3, `new[0]` is `min(a[0], b[0])`, `new2[0]` is `max(a[0], b[0])`, `new[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `new2[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`, `new[2]` is `min(a[2], b[2])`, `new2[2]` is `max(a[2], b[2])`.**
