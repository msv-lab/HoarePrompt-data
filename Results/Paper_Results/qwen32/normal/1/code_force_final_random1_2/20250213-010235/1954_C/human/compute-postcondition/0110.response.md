To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop:

```python
while i < len(a):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop condition is `i < len(a)`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must be true. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `i` is `len(a)`.
- `b` is a list of integers identical to `a`.
- `new` is a list of integers where `new[i]` is `a[i]`.
- `new2` is a list of integers where `new2[i]` is `a[i]`.

Since `i` is currently `len(a)`, the condition `i < len(a)` evaluates to `False`, meaning the loop would not execute again with the current state.

To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` such that `i < len(a)` is `True`. The simplest way to do this is to decrease `i` by 1, making it `len(a) - 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only involves `i` and `len(a)`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `b` is a list of integers identical to `a`, `new` is a list of integers where `new[i]` is `a[i]`, `new2` is a list of integers where `new2[i]` is `a[i]`**
