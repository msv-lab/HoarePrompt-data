Postcondition: **`a` is a list, `i` is either equal to the length of `a` or not. If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, no changes are made to `new` and `new2`. If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new[j]` is set to `min(a[j], b[j])` and `new2[j]` is set to `max(a[j], b[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.**
