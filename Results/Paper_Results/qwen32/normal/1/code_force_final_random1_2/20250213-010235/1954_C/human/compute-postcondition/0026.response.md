The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `new`, `new2`) remain unchanged except for their indices which now reflect the new value of `i`. Specifically, the preconditions involving `i-1` and `i` now refer to different indices in the lists.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `a` is a list of elements; `b` is a list of elements; `new[0]` is `max(a[0], b[0])`; `new2[0]` is `min(a[0], b[0])`; `new[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`; `new2[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`**
