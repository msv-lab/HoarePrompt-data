Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is 1, `b` is a non-empty list of integers where `b[0]` equals `a[0]`, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` is `a[0]`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` is `a[0]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
