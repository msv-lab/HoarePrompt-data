In this task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). The loop variable `_` is used, indicating that the loop variable itself is not utilized within the loop body. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `t`.

To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. Given that the initial state already specifies that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

Thus, the state remains as provided, since it already meets the requirement for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000**
