To determine what will be printed by the `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 999. This implies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
   - The condition `4 * n - 2 == k` is evaluated. This means that if this equation holds true, `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`.

2. **Expression Analysis:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `ceil(k / 2)`. This means we need to divide `k` by 2 and then take the ceiling of the result, which rounds up to the nearest integer.

3. **Possible Values of `k`:**
   - If `4 * n - 2 == k`, then `k` is an even number because it is 2 less than a multiple of 4.
   - If `4 * n - 2 != k`, then `k` could be any integer, but we only need to consider the case where `k` is even for the condition to hold true, as the problem does not specify other constraints on `k`.

4. **Ceiling Calculation:**
   - If `k` is even, say `k = 4 * n - 2`, then `k / 2` is an integer `(2 * n - 1)`. Taking the ceiling of an integer does not change its value.
   - If `k` is odd, `k / 2` would be a non-integer, and taking the ceiling would round it up to the next integer.

Given the initial state, we know that `k` is defined by the condition `4 * n - 2 == k`, so `k` is always even and `k / 2` is an integer. Therefore, the ceiling function will not change the value.

**Final Output:**
The `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the integer value of `k / 2` since `k` is always even when the condition `4 * n - 2 == k` is true.

Output: **(2 * n - 1) (where k = 4 * n - 2)**
