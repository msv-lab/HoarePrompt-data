Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then prints a result based on the value of `k` relative to `n`, specifically printing the ceiling of `k/2` if `k` is less than or equal to `4n - 4`, `2n - 1` if `k` equals `4n - 3`, and `2n` if `k` equals `4n - 2`.**
