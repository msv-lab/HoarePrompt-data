The code snippet splits the string `s` into two parts and maps them to integers, assigning these integers to `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `s` is the next line from the input file; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from splitting and mapping the string `s`.**
