Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `n` is either 1 (if the original value of `n` was 1) or the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `n`. Additionally, `power` is either equal to `n` (if the initial condition `power == n` was true) or decreased by 1 (if the initial condition `power == n` was false).**
