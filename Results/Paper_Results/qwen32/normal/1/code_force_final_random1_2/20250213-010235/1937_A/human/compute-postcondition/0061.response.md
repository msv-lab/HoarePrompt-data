Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases) and `n` (an integer for each test case representing some value). For each test case, the function performs an operation based on the value of `n` and returns a result. Specifically, if `n` is within the range 1 to 10^9, the function returns a result determined by the unspecified logic within the function body. There are no specified error conditions or additional constraints on the return values other than those implied by the test case structure.**
