To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n_cases`.

Here's the analysis:

- The variable `i` is the loop counter that will iterate from 0 up to `n_cases - 1`.
- The variable `n_cases` determines how many times the loop will execute.

For the loop to execute at least once, `n_cases` must be greater than 0. The initial value of `i` before the loop starts should be 0 because the `range(n_cases)` function in Python starts counting from 0.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, this information is not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition. However, since `n_cases` is the integer read from the input representing the number of test cases, we need to ensure that `n_cases` is set correctly based on the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n_cases` is greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0**
