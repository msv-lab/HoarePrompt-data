Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` is the integer input by the user.
- `power` is set according to whether it was equal to `n` or not.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, `n`, `power`). It simply prints the integer `1`.

### Output:
The code will print the number `1`.

Output: **1**
