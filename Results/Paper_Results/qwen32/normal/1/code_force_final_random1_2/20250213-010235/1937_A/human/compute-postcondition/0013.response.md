The value of `power` is incremented by 1. Initially, `power` is 3, so after the operation, `power` becomes 4. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the original value of `n` must be greater than 4, `n` must be greater than 3, `power` is 4**.
