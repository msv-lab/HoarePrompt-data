Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is \(\log_2(t)\), `power` is \(\log_2(t) - 1\).**

Natural Language: The value of `power` has been decremented by 1, making it \(\log_2(t) - 1\). All other variables retain their initial values.
