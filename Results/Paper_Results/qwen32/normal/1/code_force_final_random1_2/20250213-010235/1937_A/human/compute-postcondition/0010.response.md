To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition:

```
while power < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we know that the loop will continue to execute as long as `power` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- The original value of `n` must be greater than 2
- `n` is log2(original value of n)
- `power` is 2

We need to ensure that `power < n` holds true for the loop to execute one more time. 

### Analysis:
- `power` starts at 2.
- `n` is calculated as the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `power` must be less than `n`.
- Since `power` is initially 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

Since `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the original value of `n`, and the original value of `n` must be greater than 2, `n` itself must be greater than 1 (because log2(2) = 1).

However, to ensure that `power < n` holds true and the loop can execute one more time, `n` should be greater than 2 (since `power` is 2).

### Adjustment:
- We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2.
- Given that `n` is log2(original value of n), the original value of `n` must be greater than 4 (since log2(4) = 2, and we need `n` to be greater than 2).

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time:
- The original value of `n` must be greater than 4.
- Consequently, `n` (which is log2(original value of n)) must be greater than 2.

No other states need to be adjusted as per the loop condition.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, the original value of `n` must be greater than 4, `n` is log2(original value of n) and must be greater than 2, `power` is 2**
