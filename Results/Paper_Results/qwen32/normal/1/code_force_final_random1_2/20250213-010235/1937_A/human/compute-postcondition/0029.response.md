To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop condition: `power` and `n`.

Given:
- `power` starts at 2.
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of an integer input by the user, where the integer is greater than 2.

The loop condition is `while power < n:`. For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `n`.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `power` is 2.
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of some integer greater than 2.

Since `n` is the base-2 logarithm of an integer greater than 2, `n` must be greater than 1. However, we need to ensure that `power` is still less than `n` for the loop to continue executing.

To guarantee that the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `power` remains less than `n`. Since `power` starts at 2, `n` must be greater than 2 to allow the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 2**
