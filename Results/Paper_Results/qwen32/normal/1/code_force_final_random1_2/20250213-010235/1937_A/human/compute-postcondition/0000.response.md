The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n_cases`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The value of `t` is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is the integer read from the input representing the number of test cases.**
