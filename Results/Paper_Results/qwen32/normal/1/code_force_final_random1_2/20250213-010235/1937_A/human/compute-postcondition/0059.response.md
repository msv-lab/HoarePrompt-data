Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `n` is the integer input by the user. If `n` is equal to 1, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `n` is set to \(\log_2(t)\) and `power` is either \(\log_2(t)\) if `power` equals `n`, or \(\log_2(t) - 1\) otherwise.**
