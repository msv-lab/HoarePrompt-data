To determine what will be printed by the `print(2 ** power)` statement, let's break down the given initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is defined as `log2(original value of n)`. However, there seems to be a confusion here because `n` is defined in terms of itself. We'll assume `n` is actually defined as `log2(some_value)` where `some_value` is a given integer.
- `power` is set to `n`, so `power` is also `log2(some_value)`.

Given this context, `power` holds the logarithm base 2 of some value. When we execute `print(2 ** power)`, we are essentially calculating \(2^{\log_2(\text{some\_value})}\).

By the properties of logarithms, \(2^{\log_2(\text{some\_value})} = \text{some\_value}\). Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the original value of `some_value` that was used to compute `n`.

However, since the exact value of `some_value` is not provided in the initial state, we can only express the output in terms of `some_value`.

Output: **some_value (where some_value is the original value used to compute n)**

But if we assume that `some_value` is the intended `n` from the initial state (which is not explicitly defined but implied), then the output would simply be the value of `n` if it were a power of 2.

Since the problem does not specify the exact `some_value`, the most precise answer based on the given information is:

Output: **2 ** power (where power is log2(some_value))**

However, if we assume `some_value` is indeed `n` and `n` is a power of 2, then the output simplifies to:

Output: **n (where n is the original value used to compute power)**

Given the ambiguity, the most accurate representation based on the provided information is:

Output: **2 ** power (where power is log2(some_value))**
