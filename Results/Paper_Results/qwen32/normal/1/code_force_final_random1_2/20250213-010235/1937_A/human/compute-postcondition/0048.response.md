To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `power` and `n`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that \(2 < t \leq 10^4\)
- `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0
- `i` is 2
- `n` is \(\log_2(t)\)
- `power` is 2

The loop condition is:
```
while power < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `power` is 2.

Let's analyze the values:
- Since \(2 < t \leq 10^4\), the value of `n` (\(\log_2(t)\)) ranges from slightly more than 1 (since \(2^1 = 2\)) up to 14 (since \(2^{14} = 16384\) which is greater than \(10^4\)).
- `power` is currently 2.

For the loop to continue executing, `power` must be less than `n`. Since `power` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, `n` should be adjusted to be greater than 2. Given that `n` is \(\log_2(t)\), `t` should be adjusted to be greater than \(2^2 = 4\).

No other states need to be adjusted as per the requirement to only change the states of objects in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(4 < t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is \(\log_2(t)\) where \(t > 4\), `power` is 2**
