To determine the final state of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and when it terminates. The loop increments `power` by 1 in each iteration until `power` is no longer less than `n`.

From the given information:
- After 1 iteration, `power` becomes 2, implying `n` must be greater than 2.
- After 2 iterations, `power` becomes 3, implying `n` must be greater than 3.
- After 3 iterations, `power` becomes 4, implying `n` must be greater than 4.

This pattern indicates that the loop will continue to run until `power` is equal to `n`. Therefore, the loop will terminate when `power` equals `n`.

Thus, the final state of the loop will be when `power` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the integer input by the user, `power` is equal to `n`.**

In simpler terms, the loop will keep running until `power` catches up with `n`, which is the base-2 logarithm of the user's input integer. At this point, `power` will be exactly equal to `n`, and the loop will stop executing.
