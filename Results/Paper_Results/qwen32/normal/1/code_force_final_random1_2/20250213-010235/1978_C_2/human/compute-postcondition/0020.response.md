To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the function call `l = func_3(c, l)`. However, the function `func_3` is not defined in the provided context. Without knowing what `func_3` does, we cannot definitively determine the new value of `l`.

Since the problem specifies that `l` was initially modified by `func_3(2, l)`, we can assume that `func_3` modifies the list `l` in some way. After the second call `l = func_3(c, l)`, where `c` is still 2, `l` will again be modified according to whatever logic `func_3` implements.

Given that we don't have the definition of `func_3`, we can only say that `l` will be updated to whatever `func_3` returns when called with `c` as 2 and the current `l`.

Therefore, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is not equal to 0; `l` is a list modified by `func_3(2, l)` twice; `c` is 2; `i` is 1.**

This means that `l` has been modified twice by the function `func_3` with `c` as 2, but the exact contents of `l` remain unknown without the function's definition.
