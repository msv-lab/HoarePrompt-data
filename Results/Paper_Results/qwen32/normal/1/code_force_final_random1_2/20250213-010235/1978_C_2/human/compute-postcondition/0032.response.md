Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact:

- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `i` has been incremented by 1.
- If `k` is 0, the program encounters an error because `l` is not defined.
- If `k` is not 0, `x` is assigned the last element of `l`, but since `l` is not defined, this assignment cannot occur.

The code snippet is:
```python
l.pop(-1)
```

Since `l` is not defined, executing `l.pop(-1)` will raise an error. However, based on the problem statement, we should consider the scenario where `l` is defined and proceed with the operation.

If `l` were defined, `l.pop(-1)` would remove and return the last element of the list `l`. Since the code does not handle the return value, we assume it is discarded.

Therefore, the list `l` would lose its last element.

However, since the problem specifies that `l` is not defined, the correct interpretation is that an error occurs, and no changes are made to the existing variables.

Given the constraints and the problem statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the error condition which is implied rather than explicitly stated in the output.

Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, and `i` has been incremented by 1. If `k` is 0, the program encounters an error because `l` is not defined. If `k` is not 0, `x` is assigned the last element of `l`, but since `l` is not defined, this assignment cannot occur.**
