Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is not equal to 0, now equal to `k - i + 1`; `l` is a list modified by `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is 2; `c` is 2; `i` is 1. Since `k` is not equal to 0, the program does not return the list `l` and continues with the rest of the code after the if-else block.**
