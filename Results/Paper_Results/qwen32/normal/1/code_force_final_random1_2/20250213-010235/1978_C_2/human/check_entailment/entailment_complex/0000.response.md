### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to ensure that the program correctly handles all test cases according to the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program works and verifies the correctness:

1. **Input Handling (`func_4`)**:
   - The function `func_4` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It checks if `k` is odd. If so, it returns `(0, 0)` because an odd Manhattan value cannot be achieved with the given constraints.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` based on whether `n` is odd or even.
   - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)` because it is impossible to achieve such a high Manhattan value with the given `n`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **Permutation Construction (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.
   - It starts with the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates through the list in reverse steps of 2, adjusting the list to increase the Manhattan value.
   - If `k` becomes zero during the process, it returns the current permutation.
   - If `k` is less than `i - 1` for some `i`, it calls `func_2` to make the final adjustments.
   - It uses `func_3` to swap elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value.

3. **Swapping Elements (`func_2` and `func_3`)**:
   - `func_2` swaps two specific elements in the list to fine-tune the Manhattan value.
   - `func_3` swaps the `c`-th element with the `c`-th last element in the list to adjust the permutation.

4. **Output (`func_5`)**:
   - The function `func_5` prints "YES" followed by the permutation if a valid permutation is found.
   - If no valid permutation is found (indicated by `n == 0`), it prints "NO".

5. **Main Loop (`func_6`)**:
   - The function `func_6` orchestrates the process for each test case.
   - It calls `func_4` to get the values of `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to construct the permutation and `func_5` to print the result.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value.
- The logic for constructing the permutation ensures that the Manhattan value matches `k`.
- The swapping functions (`func_2` and `func_3`) correctly adjust the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
