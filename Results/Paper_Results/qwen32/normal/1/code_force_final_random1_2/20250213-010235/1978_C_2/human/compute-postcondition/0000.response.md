The code snippet assigns the values returned from the function `func_4()` to the variables `n` and `k`. Given that the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer, after executing the code, `n` and `k` will take on whatever values are returned by `func_4()`. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`.**
