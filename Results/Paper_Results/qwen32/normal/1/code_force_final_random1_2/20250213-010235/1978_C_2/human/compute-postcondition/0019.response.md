The code snippet modifies the value of `k` by setting it to `k - i + 1`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 1, so the new value of `k` will be `k - 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `k`.

Since `k` remains unchanged and no other variables are modified by the given code snippet, the output state reflects this.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is not equal to 0; `l` is a list modified by `func_3(2, l)` where `c` is 2; `c` is 2; `i` is 1.**
