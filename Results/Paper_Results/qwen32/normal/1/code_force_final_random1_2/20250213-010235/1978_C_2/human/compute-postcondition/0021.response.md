The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates from `n` down to `-1` with a step of `-2`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` should be decremented by 2 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `1 - 2 = -1`.

Since `i` is now `-1`, the loop condition `range(n, -1, -2)` will not allow the loop to execute again because `i` is no longer within the range.

However, if we were to consider the state just before `i` becomes `-1` (i.e., the state at the start of the current iteration), then `i` would be `1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration (which does not exist because `i` is already out of bounds) would be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is not equal to 0; `l` is a list modified by `func_3(2, l)` twice; `c` is 2; `i` is -1**

But since the loop does not execute again when `i` is `-1`, the correct state at the start of the current iteration (which is the last valid iteration) is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is not equal to 0; `l` is a list modified by `func_3(2, l)` twice; `c` is 2; `i` is 1**
