Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`. `n` is not equal to 0; `l` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`**.

Explanation: The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are the outputs from `func_4()`. The new variable `l` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`.
