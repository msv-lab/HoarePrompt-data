The value of `b` is updated to be the sum of its original value and the value of `c`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer where 0 <= a <= 10^9, `b` is an integer where 0 <= b <= 10^9 and `b` is now equal to its original value plus `c`, `c` is an integer where 0 <= c <= 10^9.**
