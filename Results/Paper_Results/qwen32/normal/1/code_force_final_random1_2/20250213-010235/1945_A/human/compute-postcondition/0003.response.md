To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

The expression is:
```python
(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]
```

This expression uses tuple indexing. The tuple `(a - -b // 3, -1)` contains two elements:
1. `a - -b // 3`
2. `-1`

The index for this tuple is determined by the condition `c < b % 3`. This condition evaluates to either `True` or `False`.

Let's analyze the two possible cases:

### Case 1: `c < b % 3` is `True`
- In this case, the index is `0`, so the expression evaluates to the first element of the tuple: `a - -b // 3`.
- Note that `a - -b // 3` is equivalent to `a + b // 3` because subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart.

### Case 2: `c < b % 3` is `False`
- In this case, the index is `1`, so the expression evaluates to the second element of the tuple: `-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `a` is an integer where 0 <= a <= 10^9.
- `b` is an integer where 0 <= b <= 10^9, but it is now equal to its original value plus `c`.
- `c` is an integer where 0 <= c <= 10^9.

We need to consider the value of `b % 3` and compare it with `c` to determine which case applies.

#### Determining the Output:
- If `c < b % 3`, the output will be `a + b // 3`.
- If `c >= b % 3`, the output will be `-1`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, we cannot compute a specific numerical output. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions.

### Final Answer:
Output: **either `a + b // 3` if `c < b % 3`, otherwise `-1` (where `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9 plus `c`, and `c` is an integer between 0 and 10^9)**
