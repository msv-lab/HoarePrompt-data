Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert needs a tent by themselves. So, we need `a` tents for introverts.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert needs to share a tent with two others. Therefore, each group of 3 extroverts needs 1 tent.
3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can go into any type of tent configuration.

### Key Points:
- We need to ensure that every extrovert is part of a group of 3. If there are leftover extroverts (i.e., `b % 3 != 0`), we need to check if we can use universals to fill these spots.
- If the number of universals is less than the remainder when dividing the number of extroverts by 3 (`b % 3`), it's impossible to form the required groups, and we should return `-1`.
- Otherwise, we can use the universals to fill the remaining spots, and the total number of tents required is the sum of tents for introverts and the number of groups of 3 formed by extroverts and universals.

### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

Let's break down what this code does:
1. **Reading Input**: It reads input from standard input, skipping the first line which is the number of test cases.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - `(a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())`: This splits the input string into three integers representing introverts, extroverts, and universals.
   - `b += c`: This combines the number of extroverts and universals into a single variable `b`. This is because the universals can be used to fill in the gaps where extroverts cannot form complete groups of 3.
   - `print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])`: This is a bit tricky:
     - `b % 3`: This gives the remainder when `b` (which now includes both extroverts and universals) is divided by 3.
     - `c < b % 3`: This checks if the number of universals is less than the remainder. If true, it means we cannot form the required groups, and we should return `-1`.
     - `a - -b // 3`: This calculates the total number of tents needed. `b // 3` gives the number of full groups of 3 (extroverts + universals), and `a` is the number of tents needed for introverts. The double negative (`- -`) is equivalent to a positive sign, so this effectively computes `a + b // 3`.
     - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` uses tuple indexing to select either `a + b // 3` or `-1` based on whether the condition `c < b % 3` is true.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the program correctly handles the conditions described in the problem statement. It ensures that if there aren't enough universals to fill the gaps for extroverts, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of tents needed.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
