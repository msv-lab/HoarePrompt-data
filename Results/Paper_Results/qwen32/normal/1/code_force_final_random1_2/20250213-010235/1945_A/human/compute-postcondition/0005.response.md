The code snippet reads a line from the input (`s`), splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. 

Given the initial state, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` had specific ranges (0 to 10^9). After executing the code, `a`, `b`, and `c` will take on the specific integer values derived from splitting and converting the string `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers derived from the split and conversion of the string `s`**.
