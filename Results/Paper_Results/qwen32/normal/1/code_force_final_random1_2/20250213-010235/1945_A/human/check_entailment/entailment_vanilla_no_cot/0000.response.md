Let's analyze the given program to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to accommodate `a` introverts, `b` extroverts, and `c` universals in tents.
- Introverts require their own tent.
- Extroverts require a tent with exactly two others.
- Universals can go in any type of tent.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of tents required or return `-1` if it's impossible.

### Key Observations:
1. **Introverts**: Each introvert needs a separate tent. So, we start with `a` tents.
2. **Extroverts**: Each extrovert needs a tent with two others. Therefore, we need to form groups of three people where each group includes at least one extrovert.
3. **Universals**: They can fill any remaining spots in the tents.

### Approach:
- First, allocate tents for introverts: `tents = a`.
- Next, try to form groups of three with extroverts and universals. Each group of three requires one tent.
- After forming these groups, check if there are any remaining extroverts who cannot be placed in a group of three. If there are, it's impossible to satisfy the conditions.

### Implementation Details:
- The code provided seems to attempt this logic but has some issues:
  - The line `b += c` suggests treating universals and extroverts together, which is not entirely accurate.
  - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is intended to calculate the number of tents but has syntax errors and logical flaws.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    t = int(input[0])
    idx = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(input[idx])
        b = int(input[idx + 1])
        c = int(input[idx + 2])
        idx += 3
        
        # Tents for introverts
        tents = a
        
        # Try to form groups of 3 with extroverts and universals
        pairs_needed = b  # Each extrovert needs a pair
        if pairs_needed <= c:
            # We have enough universals to pair with all extroverts
            tents += b  # Each extrovert gets a tent with two others
            c -= pairs_needed  # Remaining universals
        else:
            # Not enough universals to pair with all extroverts
            # Form as many groups of 3 as possible
            full_groups = c // 2
            tents += full_groups
            b -= full_groups * 2
            c -= full_groups * 2
            
            # Check remaining extroverts
            if b > 0:
                # If there are remaining extroverts, it's impossible
                results.append(-1)
                continue
        
        # Add tents for remaining universals
        tents += (c + 2) // 3
        
        results.append(tents)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
