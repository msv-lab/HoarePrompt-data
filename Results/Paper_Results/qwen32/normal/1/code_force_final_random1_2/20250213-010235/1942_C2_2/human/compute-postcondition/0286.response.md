The code snippet `ans += 2 * y` modifies the value of `ans` by adding `2 * y` to its current value. The values of `y`, `even`, and `gap` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to `ans + 2 * y`; `y` is adjusted based on the previous iteration's conditions; `even` is a list with at least one element remaining; `gap` is the next element in `even`.**
