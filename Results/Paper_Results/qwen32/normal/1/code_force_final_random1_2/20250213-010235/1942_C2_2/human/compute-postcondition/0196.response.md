Postcondition: **`ans` is `(x - 2) + count + sum(odd)` if `y` was initially less than `gap_next // 2` and `gap_next > 0`. If `y` was initially less than `gap_next // 2` and `gap_next == 0`, `ans` remains unchanged from its initial state. If `y` was not initially less than `gap_next // 2`, `ans` retains its initial value. `y` is 0 if it was initially less than `gap_next // 2`; otherwise, `y` retains its initial value. `odd` is a sorted list of all odd gaps greater than 1, and `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0 with at least one element. `gap` is `gap_next`.**
