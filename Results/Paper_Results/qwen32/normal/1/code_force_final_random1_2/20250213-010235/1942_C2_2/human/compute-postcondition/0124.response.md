Postcondition: **`i` is `len(a)`, `ans` is adjusted based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, `ans` is further adjusted by adding 1. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2, `ans` is further adjusted by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` includes the new value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is reduced by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `ans`, `tmp`, and `y` remain unchanged.**
