Postcondition: **`ans` is `(x - 2) + count + sum(odd)`, `y` is `0` if `y < gap // 2`, otherwise `y` remains `y - sum(gap // 2 for gap in odd)`, `odd` is a sorted list of all odd gaps greater than 1, `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0 and must have at least one element. If `y < gap // 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
