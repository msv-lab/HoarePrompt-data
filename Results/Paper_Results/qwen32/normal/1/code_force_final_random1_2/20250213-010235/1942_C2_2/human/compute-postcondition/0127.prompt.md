Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(tt):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = x + y - 2
    tmp = []
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
            tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
            ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
            y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]
        ) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    ans += y
    print(min(ans, n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tt` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is the final computed value after all iterations, which is now `ans + y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tt` is greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `y`; `tmp` contains specific half-differences and possibly a new element; `ii` is incremented by 1; `y` might be adjusted.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `len(a)`, `ans` is adjusted based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` plus `y`. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, `ans` is further adjusted by adding 1 plus `y`. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2, `ans` is further adjusted by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` plus `y`, `tmp` includes the new value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is reduced by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is adjusted by `y`, `tmp`, and `y` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
