Postcondition: **`odd` is a sorted list of all odd gaps greater than 1 and must contain at least two elements, `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0, `gap` is the next element in `odd` after `gap_current`. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `y` is set to 0 and `ans` is decreased by `gap`. Otherwise, `y` remains `-gap // 2`.**
