The given code snippet is simply `ans += y`. This means the value of `y` is added to the current value of `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `tt` is greater than or equal to 1
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input
- `a` is a sorted list of integers
- `ans` is updated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`
- `tmp` contains specific half-differences and possibly a new element
- `ii` is incremented by 1
- `y` might be adjusted

The only variable that changes due to this line of code is `ans`. The new value of `ans` is the old value of `ans` plus the value of `y`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`tt` is greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `y`; `tmp` contains specific half-differences and possibly a new element; `ii` is incremented by 1; `y` might be adjusted.**
