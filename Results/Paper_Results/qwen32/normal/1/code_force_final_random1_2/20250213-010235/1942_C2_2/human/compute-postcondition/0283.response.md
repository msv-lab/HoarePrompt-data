Output State: **`ans` is the sum of all elements in `odd` plus `2 * y` if `y` was less than `gap // 2` initially, otherwise `ans` is the sum of all elements in `odd` plus the original `ans` plus `gap`. `y` is `0` if `y` was less than `gap // 2` initially, otherwise `y` retains its original value minus the sum of `gap // 2` for all `gap` in `odd`. `even` is a list with at least one element in both cases.**

In simpler terms: The value of `ans` is increased by `gap`. The value of `y` remains unchanged if it was not less than `gap // 2`; otherwise, it is set to `0`. The list `even` remains unchanged.
