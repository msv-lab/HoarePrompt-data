Output State: **`ans` is `(x - 2) + count + gap_current + 2 * (y - gap_current // 2)`, `odd` is a sorted list of all odd gaps greater than 1 and must contain at least two elements, `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0, `y` is `y - gap_current // 2`, `gap` is the next element in `odd` after `gap_current`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` has been updated to include an additional term `2 * (y - gap_current // 2)`. The values of `odd`, `even`, `y`, and `gap` remain unchanged from their initial states.
