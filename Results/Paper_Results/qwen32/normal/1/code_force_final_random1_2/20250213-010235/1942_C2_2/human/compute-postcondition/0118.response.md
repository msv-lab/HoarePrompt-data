Postcondition: **`i` is `len(a)`, `ans` is adjusted based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `tmp` contains the values of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for each valid condition, and `y` is reduced based on the valid conditions. Additionally, `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2.**
