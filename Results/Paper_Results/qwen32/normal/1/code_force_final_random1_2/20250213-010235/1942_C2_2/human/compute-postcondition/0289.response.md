Postcondition: **`ans` is calculated based on the previous iteration's conditions, and if `y` is less than `gap // 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + 2 * y` and `y` is set to 0. `even` remains a list with at least one element, and `gap` is the next element in `even`. If `y` is not less than `gap // 2`, no changes are made to `ans` or `y`.**
