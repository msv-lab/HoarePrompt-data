Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`; `even` list includes the new element `gap`.**

Explanation: The `even` list now contains the new element `gap`, which is calculated as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. All other conditions and values remain the same as described in the initial state.
