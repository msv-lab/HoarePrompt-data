Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is greater than or equal to 1; `ii` is incremented by 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is `x + y - 2`; `tmp` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is decreased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `ans` is increased by `tmp`. If neither condition is met, `y` and `tmp` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `y` and `tmp` are unchanged. If `a[2] - a[1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[2] - a[1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is updated by adding `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, `y` is reduced by `((a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1)`, and `tmp` includes the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` appended to it. Otherwise, `ans`, `y`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `y` and `tmp` are unchanged unless the condition `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1` is true, in which case `y` is reduced by `((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)`, `tmp` includes the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, and `ans` is updated to include `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. If `a[3] - a[2] == 2`, `ans` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
