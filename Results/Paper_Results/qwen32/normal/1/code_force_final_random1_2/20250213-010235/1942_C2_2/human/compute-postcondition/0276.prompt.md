Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even.
Code of the loop:
for gap in odd:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, containing at least one element; `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even; if `y` was initially less than `gap // 2`, then `y` is 0 and `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `2 * y`; if `y` was not less than `gap // 2`, then `y` is `y - gap // 2` and `ans` remains unchanged from its initial value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even, `gap` is the next element in the list `odd`, `y` is `y - gap // 2`, `ans` is increased by `gap` if the condition was previously met, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `gap` is the next element in the list `odd`; `ans` is increased by `gap`; `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
