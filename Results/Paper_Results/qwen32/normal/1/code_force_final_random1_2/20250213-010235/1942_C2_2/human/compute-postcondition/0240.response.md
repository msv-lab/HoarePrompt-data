The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. The values of `x`, `i`, `next_elem`, and `gap` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i + 1 == x - 1` else `a[i + 2]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `odd` contains the appended value of `gap`.**
