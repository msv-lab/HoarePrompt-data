Postcondition: **`tt` is greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `ii` is incremented by 1; `tmp` is an empty list unless `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, in which case `tmp` is a list containing `[(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2]` and `y` is `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2` unless `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, in which case `ans` is `x + y - 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**
