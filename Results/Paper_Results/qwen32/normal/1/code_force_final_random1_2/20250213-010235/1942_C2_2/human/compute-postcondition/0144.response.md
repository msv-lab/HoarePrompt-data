Postcondition: **`val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order; `i` is `i_next`; `y` is decreased by `c` (where `c` was `i_current // 2`) and then, if `y < c`, `sx` is recalculated based on the new values of `y` and `c` and increased by `y * 2`. `c` is `i_next // 2`.**
