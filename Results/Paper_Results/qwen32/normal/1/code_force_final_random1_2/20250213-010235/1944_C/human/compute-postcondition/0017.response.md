To determine what will be printed by the `print(start + 1)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state step by step:

1. **Initialization of Variables and Objects:**
   - `arr`: A list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `arr` contains at least one `0`.
   - `n`: The length of `arr`, satisfying `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
   - `nums`: A `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`. It is explicitly stated that `nums[0] > 0` and `nums[1]` is at least 1. Additionally, `nums[1]` has been decremented by 1.
   - `start`: An integer initialized to 1.
   - `vis`: A set containing the values `0` and `1`.

2. **Relevant Information for the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(start + 1)`.
   - We need to determine the value of `start + 1`.

3. **Value of `start`:**
   - According to the initial state, `start` is explicitly set to 1.

4. **Calculation:**
   - Since `start` is 1, `start + 1` evaluates to `1 + 1`, which is `2`.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the result of `start + 1`, which is `2`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **2**
