### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and the problem requirements step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Determine the final score (MEX) of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally.
- **Game Rules**:
  - Alice starts and picks an element from `a`, adds it to `c`, and removes it from `a`.
  - Bob then picks an element from `a` and removes it.
  - This continues until `a` is empty.
  - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
- **MEX Definition**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Strategy:
- Since Alice and Bob play optimally, we need to consider how they would choose elements to either maximize or minimize the MEX.
- The key insight here is that Alice can always ensure that the MEX is at least `k` if there are `k` distinct numbers from `0` to `k-1` in `a`. Bob can only prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX by removing necessary numbers.

#### Code Analysis:
- The code uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in the array `arr`.
- It initializes `start` to `0` and iteratively checks if `start` and `start + 1` are present in the array.
- If both `start` and `start + 1` are present, it decrements their counts and increments `start`.
- If `start + 1` is not present, it prints `start + 1` and exits, indicating that `start + 1` is the MEX.

#### Verification Against Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
  - Alice can pick `1`, then `0`, and so on.
  - The final `c` could be `[1, 0, 1, 0]` or similar, with MEX `2`.
- **Test Case 2**: `arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
  - Alice can pick `0`, then `1`, and so on.
  - The final `c` could be `[0, 1, 2, 3]` with MEX `4`.
- **Test Case 3**: `arr = [1, 1]`
  - Alice picks `1`, then Bob picks `1`.
  - The final `c` is `[1]` with MEX `0`.

The code correctly identifies the MEX by ensuring that it accounts for the presence of consecutive numbers starting from `0`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game, considering the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

**Correctness: True**
