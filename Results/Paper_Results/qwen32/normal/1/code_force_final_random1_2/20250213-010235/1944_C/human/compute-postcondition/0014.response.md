The given code snippet decrements the count of the element at `nums[start]` by 1. Given the initial state, `start` is 1, so the count of the element `1` in `nums` will be reduced by 1.

Since `nums[start + 1]` is greater than 0, this means there is at least one occurrence of the element `2` in `nums`. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `vis` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `arr` contains at least one `0`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0] > 0` and `nums[1]` is at least 1, and `nums[1]` has been decremented by 1. `start` is 1 and `nums[start + 1]` is greater than 0. `vis` is a set containing the values `0` and `1`.**
