Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `arr` contains at least one `0`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0] > 0` and `nums[1]` is at least 1. If `nums[start + 1]` was greater than 0, then `nums[start + 1]` has been decremented by 1 and `start` is incremented to 2. Otherwise, the program returns nothing (None). `vis` is a set containing the values `0` and `1`.**
