Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `vis` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `k`.
- `start` is set to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(start)
```

### Analysis:
- From the initial state, we know that `start` is explicitly set to `k`.
- There is no modification to the value of `start` before the `print` statement is executed.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will output the value of `start`, which is `k`.

### Final Output:
Output: **k (where k is the integer value specified in the initial state)**
