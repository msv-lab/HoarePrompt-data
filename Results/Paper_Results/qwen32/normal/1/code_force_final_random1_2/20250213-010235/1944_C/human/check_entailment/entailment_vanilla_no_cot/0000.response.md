Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob to play the game as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the MEX of the array `c` after the game, but it does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it directly calculates the MEX of the initial array `arr`, which is not the correct approach.

Hereâ€™s a brief outline of what the program should do:

1. Count the occurrences of each number in the array.
2. Simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns:
   - Alice always tries to maximize the MEX, so she will pick the smallest number that can potentially increase the MEX.
   - Bob tries to minimize the MEX, so he will pick any number, but his choice affects the MEX indirectly.
3. Track the numbers that have been added to `c` and calculate the MEX at the end of the game.

The current implementation does not correctly simulate these interactions between Alice and Bob. It simply counts the numbers and tries to find the MEX without considering the turns and strategies of the players.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import collections as c

def mex(c):
    i = 0
    while i in c:
        i += 1
    return i

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the occurrences of each number
    count = c.Counter(arr)
    
    # Initialize the set of numbers in c
    c_set = set()
    
    # Simulate the game
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
            # Alice picks the smallest number that can potentially increase the MEX
            for num in sorted(count.keys()):
                if count[num] > 0:
                    c_set.add(num)
                    count[num] -= 1
                    break
        else:  # Bob's turn
            # Bob picks any number
            for num in sorted(count.keys(), reverse=True):
                if count[num] > 0:
                    count[num] -= 1
                    break
    
    # Calculate the MEX of the final array c
    print(mex(c_set))
```

This corrected version simulates the game according to the rules and calculates the MEX of the final array `c` after all elements have been processed.
