Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective:** Determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally.
- **Game Rules:**
  - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a`.
  - Alice starts first.
  - Alice adds her chosen element to array `c` and removes it from `a`.
  - Bob simply removes his chosen element from `a`.
  - The game ends when `a` is empty.
  - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
- **MEX Definition:** The smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Strategy:
- To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many consecutive integers starting from 0 in `c` as possible.
- Bob will counter by removing elements that Alice might need to complete the sequence.
- The optimal strategy involves tracking the count of each number and ensuring that the smallest missing number is added to `c`.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the size `n` and the array `a`.
- It uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count occurrences of each number in `a`.
- It initializes `start` to 0, representing the smallest number not yet included in `c`.
- It iterates through the numbers, adding them to `c` (tracked by `vis`) and removing them from the count.
- If the next consecutive number (`start + 1`) is available, it is also added to `c`.
- The loop continues until a number is found that cannot be added to `c`, at which point the current `start` value (the MEX) is printed.

### Correctness Check:
- The logic correctly tracks the smallest missing number using the `Counter` and `vis` set.
- It ensures that Alice maximizes the MEX by always trying to add the smallest possible number to `c`.
- Bob's moves are implicitly handled by simply not adding elements to `c` when it's his turn.
- The program efficiently computes the result for each test case within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob and accurately computes the MEX for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
