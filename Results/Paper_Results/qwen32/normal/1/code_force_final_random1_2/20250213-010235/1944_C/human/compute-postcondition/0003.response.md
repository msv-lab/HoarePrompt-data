To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition `nums.get(start, 0)`. This condition checks if the count of the element `start` in the `nums` Counter object is non-zero.

Given:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
- `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr`.
- `start` is 0.
- `vis` is an empty set.

The `while` loop condition is `nums.get(start, 0)`, which translates to checking if the count of `0` in `nums` is greater than zero.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `start` is 0.
   - `nums` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `arr`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `nums.get(0, 0)` returns a value greater than 0, meaning there must be at least one occurrence of `0` in the list `arr`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `0` appears at least once in `arr`. Consequently, `nums[0]` should be greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs adjustment is the content of `arr` (and consequently `nums`) to ensure that `0` is present in `arr` at least once.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `arr` contains at least one `0`; `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0] > 0`; `start` is 0; `vis` is an empty set.**

This ensures that `nums.get(start, 0)` evaluates to a value greater than 0, allowing the loop to execute.
