Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `arr` contains at least one `0`; `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0] > 0`, `nums[1]` is at least 1, and `nums[2]` is greater than 0 if `start` was initially 2, and `nums[start + 1]` is decreased by 1; `vis` is a set containing the values `0`, `1`, and `start`; `start` is now `start + 1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `start` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
