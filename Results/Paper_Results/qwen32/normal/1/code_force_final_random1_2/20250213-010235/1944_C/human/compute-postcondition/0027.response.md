Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `arr` contains at least one `0`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `arr` with `nums[0] > 0`, `nums[1]` is at least 1, and `nums[2]` is greater than 0 if `start` was initially 2. `vis` is a set containing the values `0`, `1`, and `start`. If `nums[start + 1]` was greater than 0, `nums[start + 1]` is decreased by 1 and `start` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `nums` or `start`.**
