To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `func_1(b, a)` and its return values `c` and `d`. However, since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can only infer the output state based on the given information.

Given:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
- `b` is not equal to 0.
- `a` is less than `b`.
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`.

Since the function `func_1` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that the function returns two values, which are then returned in the order `d, c`.

Output State: **The program returns the values `d` and `c` as returned by `func_1(b, a)`.**
