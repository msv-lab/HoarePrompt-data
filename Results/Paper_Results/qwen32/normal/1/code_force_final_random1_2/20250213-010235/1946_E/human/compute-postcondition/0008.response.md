Given the initial state and the code snippet, we can determine the output state as follows:

- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
- `b` is not equal to 0.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
- `a` is divisible by `b`.

The code snippet is:
```python
return 1, -(a // b - 1)
```

Since `a` is divisible by `b`, `a // b` will yield an integer quotient. Let's denote this quotient as `q`. Therefore, `a // b = q`.

The expression `-(a // b - 1)` simplifies to `-(q - 1)`, which is equivalent to `1 - q`.

Thus, the function returns a tuple `(1, 1 - q)`.

Given the constraints, `q` is at least 1 (since `a >= b` and both are non-negative integers with `a` being divisible by `b`). Therefore, the second element of the tuple will be `1 - q`, which could be 0 if `q` is 1, or a negative integer if `q` is greater than 1.

Output State: **The program returns (1, 1 - q) where q is the integer quotient of a divided by b.**
