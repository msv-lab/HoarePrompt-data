### Reasoning:

The program aims to calculate the number of permutations of length `n` that satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximum conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness checks:

1. **Initialization of Factorials:**
   - The program precomputes factorials up to `200001` modulo `10^9 + 7`. This is necessary for calculating combinations later in the code.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - For each test case, the program reads `n`, `m1`, `m2`, the list of prefix maximum indices `p`, and the list of suffix maximum indices `s`.

3. **Basic Checks:**
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index matches the first suffix maximum index, if the first prefix maximum index is `1`, and if the last suffix maximum index is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, it outputs `0` because no valid permutation can exist under these circumstances.

4. **Combination Calculations:**
   - The program calculates the number of valid permutations using combinations. It iterates through the suffix maximum indices and calculates combinations based on the remaining elements and their positions.
   - Similarly, it processes the prefix maximum indices in reverse order to account for the constraints imposed by the prefix maximums.

5. **Multiplication of Factorials:**
   - The program multiplies the factorials of the gaps between consecutive prefix and suffix maximum indices to account for the possible arrangements of the remaining elements within those gaps.

6. **Modulo Operation:**
   - All calculations are performed modulo `10^9 + 7` to ensure that the results fit within standard integer limits and meet the problem's requirements.

7. **Helper Functions:**
   - `func_1` is an implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, used to compute modular inverses.
   - `func_2` uses `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` modulo `10^9 + 7` and then multiplies it by `a` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the use of modular arithmetic ensures that the results are within the required bounds. The combination calculations and the checks for prefix and suffix maximum indices are consistent with the problem statement.

Therefore, the program appears to be correct based on the provided logic and the example test cases.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
