The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `val`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order.
- `y` is decreased by `c` at the end of each iteration.
- `c` is defined as `i // 2`.
- `sx` is calculated based on the value of `y` relative to `c`.

Since `i` is the current element being processed in the list `val`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in the list.

Let's denote the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_current`. The next value of `i` at the start of the next iteration would be the next element in the list `val`. Since we don't have the specific values of `val`, we can denote the next element as `i_next`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change in `i`.

State: **`val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order, `i` is `i_next`, `y` is decreased by `c` (where `c` was `i_current // 2`), `c` is now `i_next // 2`, `sx` is recalculated based on the new values of `y` and `c`.**
