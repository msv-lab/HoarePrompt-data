You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #State: 
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the total number of vertices, an integer `x` representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and an integer `y`. It also receives a list of `x` distinct integers representing the chosen vertices. For each test case, the function calculates and prints a value based on the given conditions, which is the minimum of a computed result and `n - 2`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle several edge cases and logical errors that could lead to incorrect results. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans`**:
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This seems incorrect because it does not consider the actual number of triangles that can be formed. It assumes that every additional vertex can form a new triangle, which is not always true.

2. **Handling of Adjacent Vertices**:
   - The code checks if the difference between consecutive vertices is 2 (`a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`) and increments `ans` by 1. This is correct for forming a triangle directly between adjacent vertices.
   - However, the handling of even differences (`(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0`) is flawed. The code incorrectly uses `a[i] - a[i - 1]` again instead of the previously calculated difference in the loop, leading to incorrect calculations.

3. **Circular Handling**:
   - The code attempts to handle the circular nature of the polygon by checking the difference between the first and last vertices (`a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]`). However, it again incorrectly uses `a[i] - a[i - 1]` instead of the correct difference, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The final adjustment `ans += y` is incorrect because it assumes that all remaining vertices can form additional triangles, which is not necessarily true due to the constraints and the need for non-intersecting diagonals.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the vertices are not optimally placed to form the maximum number of triangles. For example, if the vertices are spread out in such a way that they cannot form additional triangles with the available `y` vertices, the code might still increment `ans` incorrectly.

Here is an example that demonstrates the incorrect behavior:

**Input:**
```
1
6 3 1
1 3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
4
```

In this example, the vertices 1, 3, and 5 already form a triangle. Adding one more vertex (e.g., 2) can form two additional triangles (1-2-3 and 3-4-5), resulting in a total of 3 triangles. However, the code might incorrectly calculate it as 4 due to the flawed logic.

Given these issues, the code is not correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
