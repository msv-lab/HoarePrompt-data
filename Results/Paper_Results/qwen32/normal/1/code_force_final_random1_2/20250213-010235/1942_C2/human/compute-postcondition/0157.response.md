To determine the output of the `print(cons)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relationships between the variables:

1. **`val`**: This list is sorted such that all even numbers come before all odd numbers. The specific values in the list are not provided, but we know the order.

2. **`sx`**: This is calculated as the sum of all elements in `val` plus the original count of `1`s in `val`. 
   - Let's denote the sum of all elements in `val` as `sum_val`.
   - Let's denote the count of `1`s in `val` as `count_of_ones`.
   - Therefore, `sx = sum_val + count_of_ones`.

3. **`i`**: This is the last element of `val`. Since `val` is sorted with all even numbers before odd numbers, `i` will be the last odd number in `val` if there are any odd numbers; otherwise, it will be the largest even number.

4. **`y`**: This variable is reduced by the sum of `i // 2` for all elements in `val`. However, since `y` is not used in the calculation of `cons`, we do not need to consider its exact value for this problem.

5. **`cons`**: This is calculated as `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`.
   - `n` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value.
   - `x` is also not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value.
   - `sx` we have already determined as `sum_val + count_of_ones`.

Given the lack of explicit values for `n` and `x`, we can only express `cons` in terms of these variables and the properties of `val`.

Therefore, the output of `print(cons)` will be expressed in terms of `n`, `x`, `sum_val`, and `count_of_ones`.

Output: **cons (where cons is min(n - 2, x + sum_val + count_of_ones - 2))**
