The value of `ans` is calculated as `x + y - 2`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`tt` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is `x + y - 2`.**
