Postcondition: **`odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, containing at least one element; `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even; `gap` is the next element in the list `odd`. If `y < gap // 2`, then `ans` is 0 and `y` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `odd`, `even`, `gap`, `ans`, and `y` remain unchanged.**
