The given code appends `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. This means that `tmp` will now contain one additional element, specifically `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `tt` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 4.
- `tmp` is initially an empty list unless certain conditions are met, in which case it contains `[(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2]` and `y` is adjusted accordingly.
- `ans` is calculated based on specific conditions involving `a[i] - a[i - 1]` and `y`.

After executing the line `tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)`, `tmp` will definitely contain `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` as its last element. The values of `tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` also remains unchanged unless recalculated elsewhere in the code, which is not shown here.

Output State: **`tt` is greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `i` is 4; `tmp` contains `[(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2]`; `ans` is calculated based on specific conditions involving `a[i] - a[i - 1]` and `y`.**
