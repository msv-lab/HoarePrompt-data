Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`; `odd` list now includes the new element `gap`.**

Natural Language: The value of `x` remains greater than 0, and `i` has been incremented by 1. The value of `next_elem` is determined by whether `i` equals `x - 1` (in which case it is `a[0] + n`), otherwise it is `a[i + 1]`. The value of `gap` is calculated as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. The list `odd` now includes the newly appended element `gap`.
