Postcondition: **`x` must be greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i == x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, and `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` is a list containing `gap` and `even` is an empty list. If `gap` is even and greater than 0, `even` is a list containing `gap` and `odd` is an empty list. Otherwise, both `odd` and `even` are empty lists.**
