Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the total number of vertices, an integer `x` representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and an integer `y`. It also receives a list of `x` distinct integers representing the chosen vertices. For each test case, the function calculates and prints a value based on the given conditions, which is the minimum of a computed result and `n - 2`.**
