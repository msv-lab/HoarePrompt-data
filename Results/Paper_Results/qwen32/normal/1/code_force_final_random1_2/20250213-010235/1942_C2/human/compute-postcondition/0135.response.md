The code snippet `sx += y * 2` updates the value of `sx` by adding `y * 2` to its current value. Given that `y` is less than `c` (where `c` is `i // 2`), the exact value of `y` is not specified, but we know the operation performed on `sx`.

Output State: **`val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order; `sx` is the original count of `1`s in `val` plus `y * 2`; `c` is `i // 2`. The current value of `y` is less than `c`.**
