The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. This operation does not affect the variables `tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, or `y`.

Output State: **`tt` is greater than or equal to 1; `ii` is incremented by 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
