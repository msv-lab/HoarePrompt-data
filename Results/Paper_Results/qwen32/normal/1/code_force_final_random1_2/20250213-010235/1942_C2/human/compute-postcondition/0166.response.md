Postcondition: **`ans` is `(x - 2) + count + gap_current + 2 * (y - gap_current // 2)` if `y < gap // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `(x - 2) + count + gap_current`. `odd` is a sorted list of all odd gaps greater than 1 and must contain at least two elements, `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0, and `y` is 0 if `y < gap // 2`. `gap` is the next element in `odd` after `gap_current`.**
