Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value read from the input, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, x, y = R()
    sx = 0
    l = list(R())
    l.sort()
    l.append(n + l[0])
    val = []
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
        if c == 1:
            sx += 1
        val.append(c)
    val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
    for i in val:
        c = i // 2
        if y < c:
            sx += y * 2
            break
        sx += i
        y -= c
    cons = x + sx - 2
    cons = min(n - 2, cons)
    print(cons)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is assigned the value `t - 1`; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from input, with `y` updated based on the loop iterations; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input with an additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it; `val` is a sorted list with at least one element, where even numbers come before odd numbers, and within each group, numbers are sorted in ascending order; `sx` is the accumulated sum of elements from `val` until the loop terminates; `i` is the last processed element in `val` before the loop terminates; `c` is the integer division of the last processed `i` by 2; `cons` is `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `val` remains sorted with odd numbers before even numbers, `sx` is the sum of elements processed, `y` is decremented by the sum of `c` for each element processed, `i` is the last element processed, `cons` is `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `val` remains sorted with all even numbers before odd numbers; `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` plus the original count of `1`s in `val`; `i` is the last element of `val`; `y` is reduced by the sum of `i // 2` for all elements in `val`; `cons` is `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
