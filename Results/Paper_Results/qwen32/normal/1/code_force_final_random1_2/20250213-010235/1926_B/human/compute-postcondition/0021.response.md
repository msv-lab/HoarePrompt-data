Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, `grid` is an n × n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1, `a` is greater than 0, `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from each of the `t` strings that were read, provided those strings contained at least one '1'. Additionally, if `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`, then `k[0]` equals `k[1]`; otherwise, `k[0]` is not equal to `k[1]`.**
