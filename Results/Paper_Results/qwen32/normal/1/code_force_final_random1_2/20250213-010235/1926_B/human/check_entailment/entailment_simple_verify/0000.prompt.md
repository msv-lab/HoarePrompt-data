You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle based on the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Square Detection**: According to the problem, a square consists of `k` consecutive rows, each containing `k` consecutive `1`s. The program checks if the counts of `1`s in the first two rows are equal (`if k[0] == k[1]:`). However, this is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square. For example, consider the following grid:
   ```
   3
   001
   011
   111
   ```
   In this case, the counts of `1`s in the first two rows are different (1 and 2), but the grid actually contains a square of size 2 starting from the second row. The program would incorrectly classify this as a triangle.

2. **Triangle Detection**: The program assumes that if the counts of `1`s in the first two rows are not equal, the shape is a triangle. This is also incorrect. For example, consider the following grid:
   ```
   3
   001
   011
   111
   ```
   As mentioned above, this grid contains a square, not a triangle. The program would incorrectly classify this as a triangle.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the triangle or square might not start from the top-left corner of the grid or might be upside down. For example:
   ```
   3
   000
   010
   111
   ```
   This grid contains an upside-down triangle, but the program would not recognize it correctly.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to check the entire grid to determine if the `1`s form a square or a triangle according to the specific rules provided in the problem description. The current implementation only checks the counts of `1`s in the first two rows, which is insufficient for accurate detection.
