Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the `n Ã— n` grid itself.

2. **Counting '1's in Each Row**: The program counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. This part is correct.

3. **Determining Shape**:
   - The program checks if the count of '1's in the first row with '1's (`k[0]`) is equal to the count of '1's in the second row with '1's (`k[1]`). If they are equal, it prints "SQUARE". Otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".
   
However, this approach does not correctly determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle. Here are the issues:
   - **Square Check**: For a square, all rows containing '1's should have the same number of '1's. The current check only compares the first two rows.
   - **Triangle Check**: For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should follow a specific pattern (either increasing or decreasing by 2). The current check does not account for this pattern.

Thus, the program fails to correctly identify the shape based on the provided criteria.

Correctness: **False**
