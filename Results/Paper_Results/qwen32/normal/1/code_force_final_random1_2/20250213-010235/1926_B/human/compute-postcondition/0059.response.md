Postcondition: **`k` is a list containing the counts of the digit '1' in each input string `b` that contained at least one '1', where the count of '1's in the first and second strings (`k[0]` and `k[1]`) are equal. `t`, `n`, `grid`, and `a` remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations.**
