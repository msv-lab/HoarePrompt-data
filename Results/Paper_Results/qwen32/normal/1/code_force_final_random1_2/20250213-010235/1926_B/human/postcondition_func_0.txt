The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an `n Ã— n` grid of strings composed of '0's and '1's. It then determines whether the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square composed of '1's and prints "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" accordingly.
