To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `results`, so we need to ensure that `results` is properly defined and populated.

Given the description, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(a, b)`. However, since the loop body is omitted, we can only adjust the state based on what's explicitly mentioned in the loop head.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Variable**: The loop iterates over `results`. Therefore, `results` must be a list that can be iterated over.
2. **Dependencies**: The length of `results` is determined by `t`, which must be greater than or equal to 0.
3. **Initialization**: Since the loop body is omitted, we don't know how `results` is populated, but we can assume it should be initialized with `t` elements.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted such that `results` is a list with `t` elements. The values of `a` and `b` are read from the input and are not directly related to the loop execution itself.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 0, `results` is a list containing `t` elements (initialization details are not specified, but it should have `t` elements)**

Since the specific values of the elements in `results` are not relevant for the loop to execute, we can leave them unspecified. The key is ensuring `results` has `t` elements. 

Final Answer:
State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 0, `results` is a list containing `t` elements**
