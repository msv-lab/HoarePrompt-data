The code appends the value of `winner` to the `results` list. The values of `a`, `b`, `t`, and the result of `func_1(a, b)` (which is stored in `winner`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `winner`, `winner` holds the result of `func_1(a, b)`**.
