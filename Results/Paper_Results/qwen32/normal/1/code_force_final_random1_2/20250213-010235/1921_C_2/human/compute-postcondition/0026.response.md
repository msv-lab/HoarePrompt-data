The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the `feat` list. This means that the `feat` list will now contain the integers from the input.

Given the initial state, `feat` was previously defined with specific elements (`n`, `f`, `a`, `b`). After executing the code snippet, `feat` will be overwritten with the new list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 1 greater than its previous value**.

Natural Language Explanation: The `feat` list is updated to contain the integers from the new input. All other variables retain their previous values.
