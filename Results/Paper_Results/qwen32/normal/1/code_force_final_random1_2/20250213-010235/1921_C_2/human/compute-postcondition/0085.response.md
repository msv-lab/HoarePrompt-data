Postcondition: **`t` is a variable, `array2` is either empty or contains the single element `arr[0] * a` depending on whether `arr[0] < b / a`, `n` (which is `feat[0]`) is greater than 0, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `i` is 0, `feat` is a list of integers where `feat[0]` > 0, `a` is `feat[2]`, and `arr` is a list of integers.**
