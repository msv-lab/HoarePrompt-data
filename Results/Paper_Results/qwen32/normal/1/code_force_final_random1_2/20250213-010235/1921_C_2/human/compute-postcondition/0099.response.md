Postcondition: **`t` is a variable, `n` (which is `feat[0]`) is greater than 0, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `feat` is a list of integers where `feat[0]` > 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 1. If `arr[0] < b / a`, `array2` includes an additional element equal to `arr[0] * a`.**
