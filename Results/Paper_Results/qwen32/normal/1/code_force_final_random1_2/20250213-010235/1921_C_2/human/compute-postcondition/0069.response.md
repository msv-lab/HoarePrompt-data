Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases.
2. **`test_cases`**: An integer that is greater than or equal to 1. This indicates the number of test cases to process.
3. **`feat`**: A list of integers. The elements of this list are:
   - `n`: The first element of `feat` and must be greater than 1.
   - `f`: The second element of `feat`.
   - `a`: The third element of `feat`.
   - `b`: The last element of `feat`.
4. **`i`**: Set to `n`.
5. **`arr`**: A new list of integers obtained from a new input line.
6. **`array2`**: A list containing all elements \((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a\) where \(arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < \frac{b}{a}\) for \(i\) ranging from 1 to \(n-1\).
7. **Condition**: The sum of `array2` plus \((n - \text{len}(array2)) * b\) is less than `f`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Explanation:
The provided code snippet contains only one line, which is a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The condition described in the initial state ensures that if the code reaches this point, it means all the conditions have been satisfied, leading to the execution of the `print` statement.

### Output:
Based on the provided information and the code snippet, the output will be:

Output: **Yes**
