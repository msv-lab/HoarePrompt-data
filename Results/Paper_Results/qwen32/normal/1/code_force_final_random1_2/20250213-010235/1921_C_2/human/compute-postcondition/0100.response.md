The code appends a calculated value to `array2`. The value appended is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given that `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`.

Thus, the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a` is added to `array2`.

Output State: **`t` is a variable, `n` (which is `feat[0]`) is greater than 0, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `feat` is a list of integers where `feat[0]` > 0, and `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `array2` includes the new element `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`.**
