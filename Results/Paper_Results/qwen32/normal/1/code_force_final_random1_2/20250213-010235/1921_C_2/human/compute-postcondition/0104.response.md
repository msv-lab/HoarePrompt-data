Postcondition: **`t` is a variable, `n` is `feat[0]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `feat` is a list of integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is `n`. `array2` contains elements `[arr[0] * a]` if `arr[0] < b / a` and `[(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a]` for each `j` from `1` to `n-1` where `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a`. The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`.**
