To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies the `array2` based on the conditions provided.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. For each iteration, it checks if the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is less than `b / a`. If the condition is met, it appends the product of this difference and `a` to `array2`.

Given the information about the first three iterations, we can generalize this behavior to all iterations. The loop will continue to check each pair of consecutive elements in `arr` until it reaches the end of the list (i.e., `i = n-1`).

Thus, the final output state will be:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` remains an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `feat` remains a list of integers obtained from the input where the first element `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, and `b` is the last element of `feat`.
- `arr` remains a list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `array2` will contain the elements `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input where the first element `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, and `array2` contains the elements `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.**

In simpler terms, `array2` will include the products of the differences between consecutive elements of `arr` and `a`, but only for those differences that are less than `b / a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
