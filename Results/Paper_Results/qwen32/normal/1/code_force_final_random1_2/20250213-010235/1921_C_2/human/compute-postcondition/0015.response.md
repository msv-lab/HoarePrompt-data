Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input where the first element `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, and `i` is 2. If `arr[2] - arr[1] < b / a`, then `array2` includes an additional element `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.**
