The code assigns the first element of the list `feat` to the variable `n`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, while `n` now holds the value of the first element of `feat`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the first element of `feat`.**
