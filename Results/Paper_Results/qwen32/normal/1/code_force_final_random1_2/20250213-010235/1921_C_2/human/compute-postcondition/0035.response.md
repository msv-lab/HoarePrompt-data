The given code appends a calculated value to the list `array2`. Specifically, it calculates `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` and adds this value to `array2`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `array2`, which now includes the newly appended value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 1 greater than its previous value, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is a list containing the element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`, and `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.**
