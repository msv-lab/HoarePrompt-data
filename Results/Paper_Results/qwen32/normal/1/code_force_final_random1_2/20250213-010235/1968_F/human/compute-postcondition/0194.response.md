Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 7`, `results` is a list containing `q + 2` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'`, and the last element is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 5]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary with keys as unique values of `pf[i]` and values as lists of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key. If `pf[i]` was not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[i]]` is now an empty list. `i` is `i + 1`.**
