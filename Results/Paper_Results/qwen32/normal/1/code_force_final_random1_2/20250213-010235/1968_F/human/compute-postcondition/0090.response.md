The code snippet increments the value of `idx` by 2. Therefore, the new value of `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 2`, `results` is a list containing one element which is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` (for `i` from 3 to `n + 2`) holds the integer value of `data[i]`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) holds the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique `pf[i]` to a list of indices where it appears.**
