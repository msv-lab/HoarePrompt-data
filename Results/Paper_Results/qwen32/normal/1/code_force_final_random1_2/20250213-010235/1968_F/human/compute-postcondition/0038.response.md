The code snippet assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to the variable `l`. Given the initial state, `idx` is `n + 3`. Therefore, `l` will take the value of the element at index `n + 3` in the list `data`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 3`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` (for `i` from 3 to `n + 2`) holds the integer value of `data[i]`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) holds the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique `pf[i]` to a list of indices where it appears, `l` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`.**
