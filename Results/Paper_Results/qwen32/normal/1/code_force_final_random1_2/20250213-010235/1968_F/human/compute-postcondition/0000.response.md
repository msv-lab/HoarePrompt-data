The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings using the `split()` method. This means that `data` will be a list of strings representing the input values.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, followed by pairs of integers `n` and `q` for each test case, and then the array `a` of `n` integers. After that, there are `q` queries, each consisting of two integers `l` and `r`.

Since the code only reads the input and splits it into a list of strings, the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, and the queries themselves are not directly modified in terms of their data types or values. However, they are now stored in the `data` list as strings.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. The array `a` contains `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
