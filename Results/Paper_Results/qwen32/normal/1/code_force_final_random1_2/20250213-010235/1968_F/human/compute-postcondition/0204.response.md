Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 6 + n`, `results` is a list containing `q + 3` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'`, the next element is `'YES'`, and the last element is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4 - n]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` is `int(data[idx - 3 + i - 1])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique value of `pf[i]` to a list of indices `i` where that value occurs, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and `x` is equal to 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
