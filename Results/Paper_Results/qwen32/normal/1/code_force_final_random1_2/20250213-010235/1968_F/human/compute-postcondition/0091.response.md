The code snippet `a = [0] * (n + 1)` reassigns the list `a` to a new list containing `n + 1` zeros. This means that all the previous values stored in `a` are lost, and `a` now consists solely of zeros.

Other variables such as `data`, `t`, `idx`, `results`, `n`, `q`, `pf`, and `mp` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + 3 + 2*q + 2`, `results` is a list containing one element which is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) holds the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary mapping each unique `pf[i]` to a list of indices where it appears.**
