Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 2*(q-1) + 6`, `results` is a list containing five elements, the first being an empty string, the second being `'YES'` if `x` equals 0, otherwise `'NO'`, the third being `'YES'` if `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`; otherwise, the third element is `'NO'`, the fourth element being `'YES'` if `x` equals 0, and the fifth element being `'YES'`.**

Explanation: The `results` list now contains an additional element, which is `'YES'`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
