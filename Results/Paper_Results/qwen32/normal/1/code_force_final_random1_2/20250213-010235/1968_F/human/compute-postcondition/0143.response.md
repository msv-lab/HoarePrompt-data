The given line of code updates the variable `v1` by assigning it the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`. This means that `v1` will be set to the list of indices from the dictionary `mp` where the key is `pf[r]`. If `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`, `v1` will be an empty list.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `data` remains a list of strings representing the input values.
- `t` remains `t - 1`.
- `idx` remains `2*n + 3 + 2*(q-1) + 6`.
- `results` remains a list containing four elements, the first being an empty string, the second being `'YES'` if `x` equals 0, otherwise `'NO'`, the third being `'YES'` if certain conditions are met, otherwise `'NO'`, and the fourth element being `'YES'` if `x` equals 0.
- `n` remains the integer value of `data[n + 3]`.
- `q` remains `q - 1` (after the current operation, it would be `q - 2` since `q` is decremented again at the end of the provided code snippet).
- `a` remains a list of `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is `int(data[idx - (n - i + 1)])` and all other elements are 0.
- `pf` remains a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements `a[1]` to `a[i]`.
- `mp` remains a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `pf[i]` and the corresponding value is a list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key.
- `l` remains the integer value of `data[idx]`.
- `r` remains the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`.
- `x` remains `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
- `v1` is now the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`.
- `v2` remains the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`.
- `it1` remains the insertion point for `l` in the sorted list `v1`.
- `it2` remains `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.
