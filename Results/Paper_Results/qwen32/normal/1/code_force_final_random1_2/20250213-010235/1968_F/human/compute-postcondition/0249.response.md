Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a` and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The array `a` contains `n` integers, each between 0 and 2^30 - 1. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 <= l < r <= n). The function returns the result of each query, which is typically some computed value based on the subarray `a[l-1:r]`.**
