The code snippet `mp[pf[i]] = []` adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `mp`. The key is the current value of `pf[i]`, and the value is an empty list.

Given the initial state, the only change is the addition of this new key-value pair to the dictionary `mp`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values where `data[idx - 3]` is a string representing an integer that is at least 1, `t` is `t + 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 4*q + 5`, `results` is a list containing `q + 2` elements where the first element is an empty string, the next `q` elements are `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the conditions checked in each iteration, and the last element is an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `pf[i]` and the corresponding value is a list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key, and now `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list.**
