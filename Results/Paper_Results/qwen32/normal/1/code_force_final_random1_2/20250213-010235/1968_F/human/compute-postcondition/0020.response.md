Postcondition: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is greater than 0, `idx` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value of `data[1]` and is at least 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[3]` which is the integer value of `data[3]`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[4]` which is 0. If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp` remains unchanged. Otherwise, there is no change to any of the variables.**
