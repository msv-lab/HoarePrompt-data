Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `2*n + 3 + 2*(q-1) + 6`, `results` is a list containing five elements, the first being an empty string, the second being `'YES'` if `x` equals 0, otherwise `'NO'`, the third being `'YES'` if `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`; otherwise, the third element is `'NO'`, the fourth element being `'YES'` if `x` equals 0, and the fifth element being `'YES'` if the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)` is true, otherwise `'NO'`. `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`, `q` is 4, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is `int(data[idx - (n - i + 1)])` and all other elements are 0, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `pf[i]` and the corresponding value is a list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` equals the key, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[r]`, or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` where the key is `pf[l - 1]`, or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`, `it1` is the insertion point for `l` in the sorted list `v1`, and `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `r` has been updated to the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
