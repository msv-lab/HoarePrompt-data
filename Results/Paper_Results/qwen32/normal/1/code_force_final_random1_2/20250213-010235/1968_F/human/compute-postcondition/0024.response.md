The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `idx` is 4, so after the increment, `idx` becomes 5. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` is greater than 0, `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value of `data[1]` and is at least 4, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[3]` which is the integer value of `data[3]` and `a[5]` which is the integer value of `data[4]`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[4]` which is 0, `mp` is `{0: [4]}`, `i` is 5.**
