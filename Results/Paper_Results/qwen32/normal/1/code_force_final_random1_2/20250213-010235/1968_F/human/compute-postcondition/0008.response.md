The value of `idx` is incremented by 2. Initially, `idx` was 1, so now `idx` is 3. The values of `data`, `t`, `results`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values, `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`.**
