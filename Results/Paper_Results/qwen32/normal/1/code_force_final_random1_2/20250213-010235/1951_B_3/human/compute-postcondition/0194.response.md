To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans, ans1))` statement, we need to analyze the values of `ans` and `ans1` based on the provided initial state.

### Analysis:

- **`ans1`**: This variable is described as the total count of elements equal to `h` (with the condition `s[0] != h`) plus any subsequent elements that do not break the loop. Additionally, `z` is set to 1 if the last element processed was equal to `h`; otherwise, it is 0. However, `z` does not directly affect the value of `ans1` as per the description provided.

- **`ans`**: The description does not specify the initial value or how `ans` is modified, so we can only assume it retains its initial value.

### Key Points:
- The value of `ans1` depends on the list `s`, the value `h`, and the condition `s[0] != h`.
- The value of `ans` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value without additional information.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of specific values for `ans` and the details of `s` and `h`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **max(ans, ans1) (where ans1 is the total count of elements equal to h (with the condition s[0] != h) plus any subsequent elements that do not break the loop, and ans retains its initial value)**
