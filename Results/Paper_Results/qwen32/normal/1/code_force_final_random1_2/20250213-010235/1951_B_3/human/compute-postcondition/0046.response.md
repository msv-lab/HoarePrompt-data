Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list where the first element is an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two parts: a pair of integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. Based on the given conditions, the function returns different values for each test case:
- Case_1: Returns `n - 1`.
- Case_2: Returns `k - 1`.
- Case_3: Returns the index of a cow with a rating greater than `x` minus 1.
- Case_4: Returns the maximum of `k - index` and `index - 1`, where `index` is a specific index in the list `ind` that is not 0 and is less than or equal to `k`.
- Case_5: Returns the smaller value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
- Case_6: Returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
- Case_7: Returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.**

Each case is mutually exclusive, meaning if one condition is met, the others are not evaluated.**
