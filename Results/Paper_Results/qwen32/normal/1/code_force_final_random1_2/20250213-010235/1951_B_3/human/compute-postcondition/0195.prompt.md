Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The second line contains n distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans = 0
    h = s[0]
    j = -1
    for i in s[1:]:
        j += 1
        if h < i:
            break
        else:
            ans += 1
    p = j
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans1 = 0
    s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
    z = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == h:
            if s[0] != h:
                ans1 += 1
            z = 1
        elif i > h:
            break
        elif z == 1:
            ans1 += 1
    print(max(ans, ans1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `p` is equal to `j`; the first element of `s` and the element at index `k-1` remain unchanged; `ans1` reflects the count of valid conditions met during the loop; `z` is 1 if any element equal to `h` was encountered, otherwise `z` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans1` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are equal to `h` (if the first element is not `h`) and any subsequent elements that are less than or equal to `h` after encountering an element equal to `h`. `z` is 1 if any element equal to `h` has been encountered, otherwise 0. `j` is the last index processed or `len(s) - 2` if the loop completes all iterations. `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans1` is the total count of elements equal to `h` (with the condition `s[0] != h`) plus any subsequent elements that do not break the loop; `z` is 1 if the last element processed was equal to `h`; otherwise, it is 0. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `ans`, `p`) retain their initial values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
