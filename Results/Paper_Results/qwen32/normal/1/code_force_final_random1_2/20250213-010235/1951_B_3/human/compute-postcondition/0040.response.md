Given the initial state, `ind` contains up to two indices of cows with ratings greater than `x`, and since `ind` is not an empty list and its length is not equal to 1, `ind` must contain exactly two indices. We know `ind[0]` is 0, so `ind` is structured as `[0, ind[1]]` where `ind[1]` is some index greater than 0.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
```

We need to determine the value returned by this statement. Since `ind[0]` is 0, we focus on `ind[1]`. The expression `ind[1] - 1` computes the value one less than the second index in `ind`. The function `min` will compare this value with `k - 1`.

Therefore, the returned value will be the smaller of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.

Output State: **The program returns the smaller value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.**
