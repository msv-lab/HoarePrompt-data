Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of distinct integers and two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of elements that can be moved to the beginning of the list such that the list remains non-decreasing when considering specific conditions involving the element at index `k-1`.**
