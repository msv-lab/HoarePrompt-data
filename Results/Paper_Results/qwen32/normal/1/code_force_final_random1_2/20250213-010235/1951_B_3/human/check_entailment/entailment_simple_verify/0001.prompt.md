You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code and compare it to the problem requirements.

### Problem Understanding:
1. We have `n` cows with distinct ratings.
2. The cows participate in a series of `n-1` matches where the winner of each match advances.
3. The first match is between the cow at position 1 and the cow at position 2.
4. Subsequent matches pit the winner of the previous match against the cow in the next position.
5. We need to maximize the number of wins for cow `k` by potentially swapping its position with another cow exactly once.

### Key Points:
- If we don't swap, the number of wins for cow `k` is determined by how many cows with higher ratings are before it in the sequence of matches.
- If we swap, we need to consider the best possible position to place cow `k` to maximize its wins.

### Analysis of the Code:
The provided code attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Reading the input values.
2. Defining a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum number of wins for cow `k`.
3. Inside `func_1`, it tries to find the indices of the first two cows with ratings higher than cow `k`.
4. Based on these indices, it calculates the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve.

However, there are several issues with the code:
1. The variable `n` is used inside `func_1` but is not passed as an argument to the function.
2. The logic for calculating the maximum number of wins is flawed. Specifically, the conditions and calculations do not correctly account for all scenarios, such as when there are no higher-rated cows, one higher-rated cow, or two higher-rated cows.
3. There is an unnecessary print statement inside `func_1` that prints `ind` when `k == 14`, which is not required and can cause issues in actual testing.
4. The logic for handling the case when there are two higher-rated cows is incorrect. It does not properly consider the positions relative to `k`.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
