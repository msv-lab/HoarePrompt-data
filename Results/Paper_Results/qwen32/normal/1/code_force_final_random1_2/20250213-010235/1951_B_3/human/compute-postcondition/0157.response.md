Output State: **`ans1` is 0; `z` is 1 if any element equal to `h` has been encountered, otherwise 0; `j` is `len(s) - 2`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `s` is a list of integers from the input with the first element swapped with the element at index `k-1`; `h` is the first element of `s`; `ans` is `len(s) - 1`; `p` is `len(s) - 2`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans1` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
