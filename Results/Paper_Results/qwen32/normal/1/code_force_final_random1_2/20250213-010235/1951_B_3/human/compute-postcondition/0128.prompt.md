Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p` is equal to `j`; the element at index `j` is now the integer that was originally at index `k-1`, and the element at index `k-1` is now the integer that was originally at index `j`; `ans1` is 0; `z` is 0; `n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `h` is the first element of `s` before the swap; `j` is `len(s) - 2` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise the last value of `j` before breaking; `ans` is the count of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to `h`.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` must have at least one element. If `i` equals `h`, `z` is set to 1, and if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` does not equal `h`, no changes occur unless `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` equals 1, in which case `ans1` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in `s`. If the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1 and `z` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `z` equals 1, `ans1` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in `s`. If the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1 and `z` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `z` equals 1, `ans1` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
