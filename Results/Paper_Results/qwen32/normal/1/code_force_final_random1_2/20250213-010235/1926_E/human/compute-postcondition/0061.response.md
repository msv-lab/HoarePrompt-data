Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output:

### Initial State:
- `t` is 9
- `n` is 0
- `k` is an input integer (we don't know the exact value, so we'll keep it as `k`)
- `L` is a list with at least one element (we don't know the exact elements, so we'll keep it as `L`)
- `pow` is 2
- `tot` is `a_next` (we don't know the exact value of `a_next`, so we'll keep it as `tot`)
- `a` is `a_next` (we don't know the exact value of `a_next`, so we'll keep it as `a`)

### Print Statement:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables**: 
   - `pow` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `k` is an input integer, so its value is unknown but will be used as is.
   - `tot` is `a_next`, and since `a` is also `a_next`, both `tot` and `a` refer to the same value, which is unknown but will be used as is.

2. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - Substitute `pow` with 2: `2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.

3. **Simplify the Expression**:
   - The expression becomes `2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - This can be further broken down into two parts:
     - First part: `2 * (k - tot)`
     - Second part: `-1`
   - Combining these: `2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` = `2 * (2k - 2tot - 1)` = `4k - 4tot - 2`.

### Final Output:
Given the above breakdown, the output of the print statement will be `4k - 4tot - 2`, where `k` is the input integer and `tot` is the value of `a_next`.

Output: **4k - 4tot - 2 (where k is the input integer and tot is the value of a_next)**
