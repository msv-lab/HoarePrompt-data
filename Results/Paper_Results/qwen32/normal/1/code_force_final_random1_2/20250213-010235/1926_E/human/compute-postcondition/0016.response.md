To determine the final state of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `n` and `L` over time. The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0. In each iteration, it calculates `m` as `(n + 1) // 2`, subtracts `m` from `n`, and appends `m` to the list `L`.

The loop will terminate when `n` becomes 0. At that point, the list `L` will contain all the values of `m` calculated during each iteration.

Let's break down the process:

1. Initially, `n` is some positive integer.
2. In each iteration, `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
3. `n` is then updated to `n - m`.
4. `m` is appended to the list `L`.
5. The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.

The final state of the loop will be when `n` is 0, and `L` contains all the values of `m` that were calculated during each iteration.

**Output State:**
- `t` remains the same as the initial value (since `t` is not modified in the loop).
- `n` becomes 0.
- `k` remains the same as the initial value (since `k` is not modified in the loop).
- `L` contains all the values of `m` calculated during each iteration.

In natural language, the final output state is that `n` has been reduced to 0 through repeated halving (with rounding up), and `L` contains all the intermediate values of `m` that were computed during the loop's execution.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; n is 0; k is the second integer read from the input; L is a list containing all the values of m calculated during each iteration of the loop.**
