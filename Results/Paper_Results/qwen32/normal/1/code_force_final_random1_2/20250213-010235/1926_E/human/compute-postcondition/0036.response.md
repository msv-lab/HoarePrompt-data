The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation condition. The loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` is not used within the loop, we only need to consider `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be decremented by 1, making it 9.

State: **`t` is 9, `n` is 0, `k` is 3, `L` is [4, 2, 1, 0], `pow` is 16, `tot` is 8**.
