In this case, the `while` loop condition is `while n:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context, and zero is considered `False`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be any non-zero integer.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is 9
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `L` is []
- `pow` is 16
- `tot` is 8

The only variable in the loop head is `n`. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be a non-zero integer. Since `n` is described as "an input integer," we need to specify that it should not be zero.

State: **`t` is 9, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is an input integer, `L` is [], `pow` is 16, `tot` is 8**
