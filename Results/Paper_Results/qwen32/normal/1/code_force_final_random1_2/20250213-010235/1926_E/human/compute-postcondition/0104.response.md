The code snippet `pow *= 2` multiplies the current value of `pow` by 2. Given that the initial state specifies `pow` is 4, after executing this line, `pow` will be 8.

Other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `tot`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 8, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list with at least two values, `pow` is 8, `tot` is `tot + 2*a`, `a` is `L[1]`.**
