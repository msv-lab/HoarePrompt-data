The code snippet reassigns the value of `m` to `(n + 1) // 2`. However, since `m` was already initialized to `(n + 1) // 2` in the initial state, this operation does not change the value of `m`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State except that we confirm the value of `m` is indeed `(n + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is 8, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `L` is [`(n + 1) // 2`], `pow` is 1, `tot` is 0, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
