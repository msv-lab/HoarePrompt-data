To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the formula used in the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is 8.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `L` is a list with at least one value.
- `pow` is 1.
- `tot` is 0 such that `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`.

### Formula Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

Let's substitute the known values into the formula:
- `pow` is 1.
- `tot` is 0.

Thus, the formula simplifies to:
```python
print(1 * (2 * (k - 0) - 1))
```
Which further simplifies to:
```python
print(2 * k - 1)
```

### Explanation:
The expression `2 * k - 1` calculates a value based on the input integer `k`. Since the exact value of `k` is not specified in the initial state, we can only express the output in terms of `k`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `2 * k - 1`.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is the input integer)**
