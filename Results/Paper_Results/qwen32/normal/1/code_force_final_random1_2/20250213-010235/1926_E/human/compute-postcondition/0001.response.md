In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1 because the range function in Python will generate numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `t`. Therefore, the key variable to consider here is `t`.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4

The loop will definitely execute as long as `t` is within this range. There are no other variables in the loop head that need adjustment (`_` is just a placeholder for the loop variable and does not affect the execution).

So, the state before the loop starts should simply reflect that `t` is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4**
