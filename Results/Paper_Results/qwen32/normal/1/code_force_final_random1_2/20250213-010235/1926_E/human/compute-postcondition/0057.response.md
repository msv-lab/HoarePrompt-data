Postcondition: **`t` is 9, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 1, and `tot` is 0. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then `tot` is less than `k` while `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`. Otherwise, the condition `tot < k and k <= tot + a` does not hold.**
