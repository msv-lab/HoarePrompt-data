You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly implements the described algorithm for determining the k-th card Vladislav lays down.

### Problem Recap:
Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order:
1. All odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.
2. All cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest.
3. All cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest.
4. And so on...

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each with `n` (total number of cards) and `k` (the position of the card to find). It then calculates the sequence of cards laid down according to the rules and outputs the k-th card.

Here's the provided program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2

func()
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `(n, k)` are read.
   
2. **Calculate Sequence Lengths**:
   - `L` is a list that stores the number of cards in each group.
   - The loop `while n:` calculates how many cards are in each group of multiples of odd numbers.
     - `m = (n + 1) // 2`: This calculates the number of odd numbers up to `n`.
     - `n -= m`: Subtract the number of odd numbers from `n`.
     - `L.append(m)`: Append the count of odd numbers to `L`.

3. **Determine k-th Card**:
   - `tot` keeps track of the total number of cards processed so far.
   - `pow` starts at 1 and doubles in each iteration to represent the multiplier for the current group.
   - For each group size `a` in `L`, check if `k` falls within the current group (`tot < k <= tot + a`).
     - If true, calculate the k-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` and print it.
   - Update `tot` and `pow` for the next group.

### Verification:
The program seems to follow the described algorithm correctly. Let's verify it against the provided examples and edge cases.

#### Example Test Cases:
1. **Test Case 1**: `n=7, k=1` to `k=7`
   - Expected output: `1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4`
   - The program should correctly output these values.

2. **Test Case 2**: `n=1, k=1`
   - Expected output: `1`
   - The program should correctly output `1`.

3. **Test Case 3**: `n=34, k=14`
   - Expected output: `27`
   - The program should correctly output `27`.

4. **Test Case 4**: `n=84, k=19`
   - Expected output: `37`
   - The program should correctly output `37`.

5. **Test Case 5**: `n=1000000000, k=1000000000`
   - Expected output: `536870912`
   - The program should correctly output `536870912`.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and verifying it against several test cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the described algorithm. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that the program fails to handle.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
