The given Python code snippet only modifies the variable `pow` by doubling its value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `tot`, `a`) are not affected by this operation.

Since `pow` was initially 4, after executing `pow *= 2`, `pow` becomes 8. 

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 9, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list with at least two elements, `pow` is 8, `tot` is `2 * a_next + a_next_next`, `a` is `a_next_next`. If `tot < k and k <= tot + a`, the conditions remain as stated. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.**
