To determine the output state, let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

Initial State:
- `t` is 9
- `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`
- `k` is an input integer
- `L` is [`(n + 1) // 2`]
- `pow` is 16
- `tot` is 8
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`

The Python code snippet is:
```python
L.append(m)
```

This line of code appends the value of `m` to the list `L`.

Let's break down the changes:
- The list `L` initially contains one element, which is `(n + 1) // 2`.
- After executing `L.append(m)`, the list `L` will contain two elements: the first element remains `(n + 1) // 2`, and the second element is `m`.

Since `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, the list `L` will now be `[ (n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2 ]`.

No other variables are modified by the code snippet, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is 9, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is `[(n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2]`, `pow` is 16, `tot` is 8, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

In natural language, the output state means:
- `t` remains 9.
- `n` remains `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- `k` remains an input integer.
- `L` now contains two elements, both of which are `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `pow` remains 16.
- `tot` remains 8.
- `m` remains `(n + 1) // 2`.
