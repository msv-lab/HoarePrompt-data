Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 1, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `res` is 1, and `count` is a dictionary with the key `(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num` incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `count`) remain unchanged.
