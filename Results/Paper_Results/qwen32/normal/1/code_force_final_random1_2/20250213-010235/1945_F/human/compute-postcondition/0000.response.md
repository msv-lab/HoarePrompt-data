The provided code snippet only defines a type variable `T` using `TypeVar('T')`. This does not affect any of the existing variables `t`, `n`, `v`, or `p`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. v is a list of integers of length n where each element satisfies 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9. p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
