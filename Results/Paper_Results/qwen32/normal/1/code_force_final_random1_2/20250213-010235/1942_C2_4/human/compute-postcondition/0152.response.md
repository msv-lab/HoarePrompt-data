The code snippet `sx += i` increments the variable `sx` by the value of `i`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `val` remains a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order. The variables `i`, `c`, and `sx` are also part of the initial state, but only `sx` is modified by the code.

Since `i` is specified as `i_new` and `c` is `i_new // 2`, these values remain unchanged. The condition `if y < c, sx is updated to sx + y * 2` does not affect the current operation because the code snippet provided is simply `sx += i`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order; `i` is `i_new`; `c` is `i_new // 2`; `sx` is `sx + i_new`.**
