The given code snippet is:

```python
ans += y
```

This line increments the variable `ans` by the value of `y`.

Given the Initial State:
- `tt` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `ans` is the final computed value after all iterations.
- Specific conditions involving `a`, `n`, and `y` have already been processed.

The only change made by the code snippet is the increment of `ans` by `y`. Therefore, the value of `ans` will now be its previous value plus `y`.

Output State: **`tt` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is the final computed value after all iterations, which is now `ans + y`.**
