Postcondition: **`tt` is greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input with at least 2 elements; `i` is 3. If `a[3] - a[2] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)`, `tmp` contains an additional element which is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, and `ans` is updated by adding `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` to its previous value. If neither condition is met, no changes are made to `y`, `tmp`, or `ans`.**
