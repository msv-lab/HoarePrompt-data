To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
```

- The variable `next_elem` is being assigned a value based on a conditional statement.
- If `i` equals `x - 1`, then `next_elem` is assigned the value of `a[0] + n`.
- Otherwise, `next_elem` is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` must be greater than 0.
- `odd` is an empty list.
- `even` is an empty list.

Since the code does not modify `x`, `odd`, or `even`, these remain unchanged. However, `next_elem` is introduced and its value depends on the condition.

Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i == x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`.**

This means that `next_elem` is calculated based on whether `i` is equal to `x - 1` or not, using the specified expressions.
