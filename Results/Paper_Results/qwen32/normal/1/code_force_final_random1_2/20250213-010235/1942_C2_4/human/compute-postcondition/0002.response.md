The code snippet assigns the values from the input, which are split into three parts and converted to integers, to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial state only specifies that `tt` must be greater than or equal to 1, which is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`tt` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input.**
