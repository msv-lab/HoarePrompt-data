Postcondition: **`odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, containing at least one element; `even` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 0 and even. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `y` is 0 and `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `2 * y`. If `y` is not less than `gap // 2`, the state of `y` and `ans` remains unchanged from their initial values.**
