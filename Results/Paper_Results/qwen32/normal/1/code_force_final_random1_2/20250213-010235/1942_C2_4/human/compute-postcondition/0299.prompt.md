Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is the sum of all elements in `odd`, and `y` is the initial value of `y` minus the sum of `gap // 2` for all `gap` in `odd`.
Code of the loop:
for gap in even:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is the sum of all elements in `odd` plus `2 * y` if `y` was less than `gap // 2` initially, otherwise `ans` is the sum of all elements in `odd` plus the original `ans` plus `gap`; `y` is `-gap // 2` if `y` was less than `gap // 2` initially, otherwise `y` is its original value minus the sum of `gap // 2` for all `gap` in `odd` minus `gap // 2`; `even` is a list with at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is updated to `ans + gap`; `y` is less than `gap // 2` (if true before, remains true or becomes false depending on the new value of `y`); `y` is set to 0 (if true before, remains 0 or becomes negative depending on the new value of `y`); `y` is not less than `gap // 2` (if false before, remains false or becomes true depending on the new value of `y`); `even` remains a list with at least one element; `gap` is the next element in `even`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `gap` is the next element in `even`; `ans` is increased by `gap`; `y` is less than `gap // 2` or `y` is not less than `gap // 2` (unchanged); `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
