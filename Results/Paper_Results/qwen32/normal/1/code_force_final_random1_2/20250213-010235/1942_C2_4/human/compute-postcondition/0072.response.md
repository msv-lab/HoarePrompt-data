Postcondition: **`tt` is greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `i` is 5. If `a[5] - a[4] == 2`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[5] - a[4]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[5] - a[4]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is decreased by `(a[5] - a[4]) // 2 - 1`, `tmp` contains an additional element which is `(a[5] - a[4]) // 2`, and `ans` is increased by `(a[5] - a[4]) // 2`. If neither condition is met, `y`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**
