Output State: **`ans` is `(x - 2) + count + gap_current + 2 * (y - gap_current // 2) + gap` if `y < gap // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is `(x - 2) + count + gap_current + gap`. `odd` is a sorted list of all odd gaps greater than 1 and must contain at least two elements, `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0, and `y` is 0 if `y < gap // 2`. `gap` is the next element in `odd` after `gap_current`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `gap` to its previous value. The conditions for `ans` remain the same, depending on whether `y < gap // 2`. The lists `odd` and `even`, and the variable `y`, retain their initial states. The variable `gap` remains the next element in the `odd` list after `gap_current`.
