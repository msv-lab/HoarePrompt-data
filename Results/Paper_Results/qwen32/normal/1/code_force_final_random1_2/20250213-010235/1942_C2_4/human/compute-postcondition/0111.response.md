Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state:

- `i` is 3.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements.
- `y` and `tmp` are unchanged except `tmp` now includes the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.

The code snippet modifies `ans` by adding the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to it.

Since `i` is 3, the expression `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` translates to `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.

Thus, `ans` is updated to include this value.

The other variables (`a`, `y`, `tmp`) remain unchanged except for `ans` which is updated.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `y` is unchanged, `tmp` includes the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, `ans` is updated to include `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.**
