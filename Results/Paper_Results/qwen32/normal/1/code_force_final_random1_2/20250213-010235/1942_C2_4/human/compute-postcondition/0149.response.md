The code snippet `sx += y * 2` modifies the variable `sx` by adding the product of `y` and `2` to its current value. The variables `val`, `i`, and `c` are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the variable `sx`. Since the exact values of `sx` and `y` are not specified, we can only express the new value of `sx` in terms of its old value and `y`.

Output State: **`val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order; `i` is `i_new`; `c` is `i_new // 2`; `sx` is updated to `sx + y * 2`.**
