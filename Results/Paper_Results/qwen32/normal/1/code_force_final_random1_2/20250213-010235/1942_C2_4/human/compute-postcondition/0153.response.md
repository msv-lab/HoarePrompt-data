The code snippet `y -= c` modifies the value of `y` by subtracting `c` from it. Given the initial state, `c` is defined as `i_new // 2`. Therefore, `y` will be reduced by `i_new // 2`.

The other variables (`val`, `i`, `c`, and `sx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`val` is a non-empty list sorted such that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers, and within those groups, numbers are sorted in ascending order; `i` is `i_new`; `c` is `i_new // 2`; `sx` is `sx + i_new`; `y` is reduced by `i_new // 2`.**
