The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `tmp`. None of the other variables (`tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `ans`, or `ii`) are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`tt` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `ans` is `x + y - 2`; `ii` is incremented by 1; `tmp` is an empty list.**
