To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

### Initial State:
- `ans` is the sum of all elements in the list `odd` plus the sum of all elements in the list `even`.
- `y` is initially some value and then it is adjusted by subtracting the sum of `gap // 2` for all `gap` in `odd` and `even`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
- `ans` is calculated as the sum of all elements in `odd` plus the sum of all elements in `even`.

### Given Code:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is computed as the sum of the elements in the lists `odd` and `even`.
- Since the exact contents of the lists `odd` and `even` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.
- However, we can describe the value of `ans` precisely based on the given information.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the sum of all elements in the list `odd` plus the sum of all elements in the list `even`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of all elements in the list `odd` plus the sum of all elements in the list `even`)**
