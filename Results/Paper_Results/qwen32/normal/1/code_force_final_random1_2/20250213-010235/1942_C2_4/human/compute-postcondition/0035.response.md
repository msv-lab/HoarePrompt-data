Postcondition: **`tt` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is the final computed value after all iterations; `tmp` is a list of half the even differences where the condition on `y` was satisfied; the sum of `a[0]`, `n`, and the negative of `a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2; the current value of `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`; the expression `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2` equals 0**
