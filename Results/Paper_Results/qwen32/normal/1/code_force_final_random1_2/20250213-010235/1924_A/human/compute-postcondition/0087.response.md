The given code snippet sets `cur` to 0. This affects the variable `cur` directly, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `ss`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, `ans` is `s` if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `ans` is an empty string.**
