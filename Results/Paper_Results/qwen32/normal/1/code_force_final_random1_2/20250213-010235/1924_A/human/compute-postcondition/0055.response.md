To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and how the variables are defined.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5 (likely a loop counter or test case count).
   - `n`, `k`, `m`: Integers read from the input.
   - `s`: A string read from the input.
   - `cnt`: The number of times `k` distinct characters were encountered in sequence. It is less than `n`.
   - `cur`: Either 0 or (1 << k) - 1 depending on the last sequence.
   - `ans`: A string constructed from characters that completed the sequences of `k` distinct characters, plus `tmp`, followed by `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters.
   - `tmp`: Either an empty string or the character `'a' + i` where `i` is the smallest index such that `(cur & 1 << i == 0)` within the range `[0, k-1]`.

2. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - `ans` is composed of three parts:
     1. Characters that completed the sequences of `k` distinct characters.
     2. `tmp`: This is either an empty string or a specific character `'a' + i`.
     3. `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters.

### Explanation:

- **Completed Sequences:** These are the characters that have already been added to `ans` because they completed sequences of `k` distinct characters.
- **`tmp`:** This is a placeholder for a character that might be needed to complete another sequence of `k` distinct characters. If no such character is needed, `tmp` is an empty string.
- **Remaining 'a's:** After accounting for the completed sequences and `tmp`, the remaining part of the string `ans` is filled with `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters.

### Final Output:

Given the above breakdown, the `print(ans)` statement will output a string that consists of:
- Characters that completed the sequences of `k` distinct characters.
- Possibly one additional character (`tmp`), if needed.
- The rest of the string filled with 'a' characters up to the length `n`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, and `tmp` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact string that will be printed. However, we can describe the structure of the output based on the given information.

Output: **ans (where ans is a string consisting of characters that completed sequences of k distinct characters, possibly one additional character tmp, and the rest filled with (n - cnt - 1) 'a' characters)**
