The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next character in the string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5
- `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input
- `s` is a non-empty string read from the input
- `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`
- If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `ss`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` was some character from the string `s`. For the next iteration, `ss` should be the next character in the string `s`.

Let's denote the current character as `s[i]`. The next character in the string would be `s[i+1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `ss`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string.**

Since we don't have the exact position of the current character `ss` in the string `s`, we can represent the state in terms of the next character. Assuming `ss` was `s[i]` in the previous iteration, the next character would be `s[i+1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is an empty string.**

Note: The values of `cnt` and `ans` remain unchanged unless `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1` during the current iteration, which we cannot assume here. Thus, we keep them as per the given conditions.
