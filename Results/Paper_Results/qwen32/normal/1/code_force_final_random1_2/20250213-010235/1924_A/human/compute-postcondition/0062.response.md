The given code snippet sets the variable `cur` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, or `ans`. The only change is that `cur` is explicitly set to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the newly read string from the input; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0; `ans` is a string containing the characters that completed the sequences of k distinct characters.**
