The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the character `ss` to the string `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` is either `s` (if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`) or an empty string. After appending `ss` to `ans`, the new value of `ans` will be the previous value of `ans` concatenated with `ss`.

Since the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, `cur`, `cnt`) are not modified by this line of code, they retain their initial values.

Therefore, the updated output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `ss`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, `ans` is `s + ss` if `cur` initially equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `ans` is `ss`.**
