The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the character `ss` to the string `ans`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `ans` was an empty string, and `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.

After executing the code, `ans` will now contain the character `ss` as its first (and only) character.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the zero-based index of `ss` in the alphabet; `cnt` is 1; `ans` is a string containing the character `ss`; `cur` is 0. If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`**
