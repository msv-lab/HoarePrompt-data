To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0 because `range(k)` generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `k`. If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

The initial state provided is:
- `cnt` is less than `n`
- `tmp` is an empty string

Since `cnt` and `tmp` are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The only relevant variable here is `k`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `k` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized automatically by the `range` function and does not need to be set manually before the loop starts.

State: **`cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string, `k` must be greater than 0**
