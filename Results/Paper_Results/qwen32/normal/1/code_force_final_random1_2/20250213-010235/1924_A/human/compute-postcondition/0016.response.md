Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `ss`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string.**
