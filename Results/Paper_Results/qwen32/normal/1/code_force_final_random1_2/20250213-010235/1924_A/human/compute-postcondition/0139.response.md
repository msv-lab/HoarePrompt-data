The given code snippet calculates the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (where 'a' corresponds to 0, 'b' to 1, ..., 'z' to 25). This is done by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of `ss`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is the integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z').**
