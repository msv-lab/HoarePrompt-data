Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the string read from the input; `cnt` is the number of times k distinct characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 or (1 << k) - 1 depending on the last sequence; `ans` is a string containing the characters that completed the sequences of k distinct characters. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, no further changes are made to `ans`. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is extended by `tmp` followed by `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters, where `tmp` is either an empty string or the character `'a' + i` with `i` being the smallest index such that `(cur & 1 << i == 0)` within the range `[0, k-1]`.**
