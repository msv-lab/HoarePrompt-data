To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and how the variables interact with each other:

1. **Variables and their meanings**:
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5 (This seems to be related to the number of test cases, but it doesn't directly affect the current context).
   - `n`, `k`, `m`: Integers read from the input.
   - `s`: A string read from the input.
   - `cnt`: The number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively in `s`.
   - `cur`: A bitmask representing the last incomplete set of `k` unique characters.
   - `ans`: The resulting string containing characters from `s` that completed sets of `k` unique characters with `tmp` appended plus 'a' repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.
   - `tmp`: A character determined based on the bitmask `cur`.
   - `i`: Index used in determining `tmp`.

2. **Understanding the construction of `ans`**:
   - `ans` is constructed by appending characters from `s` that form complete sets of `k` unique characters.
   - After forming these sets, `tmp` is appended.
   - Finally, 'a' is repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times and appended to `ans`.

Given this information, the output of `print(ans)` will be the string `ans` as described above. Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, and `tmp` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact string. However, we can describe the structure of `ans` based on the given conditions.

**Output Description**:
- `ans` starts with characters from `s` that form complete sets of `k` unique characters.
- It then includes `tmp`, which is a character determined by the bitmask `cur`.
- Finally, it includes 'a' repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.

Therefore, the output will be a string that follows the above structure.

Output: **ans (where ans is a string consisting of characters from s that form complete sets of k unique characters, followed by tmp, and then 'a' repeated (n - cnt - 1) times)**
