The code snippet provided increments the variable `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5
- `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `ss`
- `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`
- If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur | (1 << cur_ss)`
- `cnt` is 1 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` is 0
- `ans` is `s` if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `ans` is an empty string

After executing `cnt += 1`, the only change is that `cnt` is now `cnt + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `ss`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is updated based on the condition `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, `ans` is `s` if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `ans` is an empty string.**
