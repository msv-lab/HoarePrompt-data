To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`tmp` Calculation**:
   - `tmp` is set to the character `'a' + i` where `i` is the smallest index such that `cur & 1 << i == 0`.
   - If no such `i` exists within the range `[0, k-1]`, `tmp` remains an empty string.
   
2. **`ans` Update**:
   - `ans` is updated to `ans + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(ans)` statement will output the current value of the variable `ans`.
- From the initial state, we know that `ans` is updated by appending a certain number of `'a'` characters to it. Specifically, it appends `'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` to `ans`.

### Key Variables:
- `ans`: This variable accumulates a string of `'a'` characters based on the formula `ans + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`.
- `n`, `cnt`: These are used in the formula to determine how many `'a'` characters to append to `ans`.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `n` and `cnt` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables. The `print(ans)` statement will output the accumulated string `ans` which includes the original `ans` plus `'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`.

Thus, the output can be described as:

Output: **ans (where ans is the original value of ans concatenated with 'a' repeated (n - cnt - 1) times)**
