The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only terminates the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. Therefore, none of the variables `cnt`, `n`, `k`, `i`, or `tmp` are modified.

Output State: **`cnt` is less than `n`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `k`, `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + i)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
