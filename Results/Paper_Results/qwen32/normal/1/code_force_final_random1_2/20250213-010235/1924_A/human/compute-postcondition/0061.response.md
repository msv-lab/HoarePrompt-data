Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the newly read string from the input; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0 or (1 << k) - 1 depending on the last sequence; `ans` is a string containing the characters that completed the sequences of k distinct characters.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` has been reset to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, and `ans`) retain their initial values.
