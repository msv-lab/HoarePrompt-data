The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` sets the bit at position `cur_ss` in the integer `cur` to 1. Given that initially `cur` does not have the bit at position `cur_ss` set to 1, after executing this line, the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` will be set to 1.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5.
- `n`, `k`, `m` remain the integers read from the input.
- `s` remains a non-empty string.
- `cnt` remains 0.
- `cur` now has the bit at position `cur_ss` set to 1.
- `ans` remains an empty string.
- `cur_ss` remains `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `cnt` is 0; `cur` has the bit at position `cur_ss` set to 1; `ans` is ''; `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`.**
