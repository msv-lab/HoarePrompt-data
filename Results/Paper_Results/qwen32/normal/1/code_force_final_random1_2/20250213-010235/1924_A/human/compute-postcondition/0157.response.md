The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`) and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i_prev + 1`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as long as it is greater than the new value of `i`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i_prev + 1`, which simplifies to just `i` being incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`cnt` is less than `n`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**

However, since we typically denote the new value of `i` directly as `i` in the context of the loop, we can simply say:

State: **`cnt` is less than `n`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
