The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `cnt`, `n`, `k`, `i`, or `tmp`. It only exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed within. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is less than `n`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `tmp` is the character 'a' + `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
