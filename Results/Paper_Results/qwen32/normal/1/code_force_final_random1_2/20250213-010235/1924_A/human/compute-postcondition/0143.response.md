The given code snippet initializes the variable `cur` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, `cnt`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is the integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'); If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0, then `cur` is updated to `cur + 2^cur_ss`; `cnt` is incremented by 1; `cur` is 0.**
