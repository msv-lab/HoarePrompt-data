The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` sets the bit at position `cur_ss` in the variable `cur` to 1. Given the initial state, `cur` was initially 0, and `cur_ss` is derived from the ASCII value difference between `ss` and 'a'.

After executing the code, the new value of `cur` will be `1 << cur_ss`, which means the bit at position `cur_ss` will be set to 1 while all other bits remain 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`; `ans` is an empty string; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. Additionally, the bitwise AND of `cur` and `1 << cur_ss` equals `1 << cur_ss`, indicating that the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is now set.**
