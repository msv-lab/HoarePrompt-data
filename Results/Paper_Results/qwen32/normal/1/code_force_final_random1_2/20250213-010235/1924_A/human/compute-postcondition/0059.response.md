The code snippet `s = input()` reads a new string from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. This means the previous value of `s` is replaced with the newly input string. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the newly read string from the input; `cnt` is the number of times k distinct characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 or (1 << k) - 1 depending on the last sequence; `ans` is a string containing the characters that completed the sequences of k distinct characters.**
