The given code snippet modifies the variable `cur` by performing a bitwise left shift operation on `1` by the value of `cur_ss` and then adding the result to `cur`. 

Given that `cur_ss` is the integer value representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), the value of `1 << cur_ss` will be a power of 2 corresponding to the position of `ss`.

Let's denote the original value of `cur` as `original_cur`. After executing the line `cur += 1 << cur_ss`, the new value of `cur` will be `original_cur + 2^cur_ss`.

Since the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `ss` are not modified by this line of code, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is the integer value representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'); `cur` is `original_cur + 2^cur_ss`.**
