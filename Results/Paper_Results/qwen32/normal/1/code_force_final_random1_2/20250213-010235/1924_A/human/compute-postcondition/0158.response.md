The code assigns `tmp` the character corresponding to the ASCII value of 'a' plus the current value of `i`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, the value of `tmp` will be the next character in the alphabet sequence starting from 'a'.

Output State: **`cnt` is less than `n`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `tmp` is the character 'a' + `i`**.
