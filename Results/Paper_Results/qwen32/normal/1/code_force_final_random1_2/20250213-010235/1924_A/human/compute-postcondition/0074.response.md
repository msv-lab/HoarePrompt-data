The only variable in the loop head is `ss`, which represents each character in the string `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ss` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5
- `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25
- If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is the string `s`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string

Since the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `ss` should be the next character in the string `s`.

Let's denote the current character as `s[cur_ss]`. For the next iteration, `ss` should be `s[cur_ss + 1]`. However, since `cur_ss` is not directly part of the loop head, we need to infer the next character based on the current state of `ss`.

Assuming `ss` was `s[cur_ss]` in the previous iteration, in the next iteration, `ss` should be `s[cur_ss + 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` (i.e., `s[cur_ss + 1]`). If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is the string `s`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string.**

However, since `cur_ss` is not directly part of the loop head, we can simply state that `ss` is the next character in the string `s` without explicitly mentioning `cur_ss` in the final state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is the string `s`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains an empty string.**
