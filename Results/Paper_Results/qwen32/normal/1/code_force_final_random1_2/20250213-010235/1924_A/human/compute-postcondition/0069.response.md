Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25. If the bitwise AND of `cur` and `1 << cur_ss` is `1 << cur_ss`, then `cur` is set to `1 << cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. Additionally, `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`.**
