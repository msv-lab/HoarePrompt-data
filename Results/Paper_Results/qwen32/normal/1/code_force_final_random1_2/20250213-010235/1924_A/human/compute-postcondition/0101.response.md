The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` has just finished its current iteration, meaning it was some value from 0 to `k-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had a value from 0 to `k-1`.
2. The loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration.
3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input where `k` must be greater than 0; `s` is the newly read string from the input; `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively in `s`; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete set; `ans` is the string containing characters from `s` that completed sets of `k` unique characters; `cnt` is less than `n`; if the `i`-th bit of `cur` was 0, `tmp` is a character between 'a' and 'z' determined by `chr(ord('a') + i)`; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since we are only adjusting `i`:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input where `k` must be greater than 0; `s` is the newly read string from the input; `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively in `s`; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete set; `ans` is the string containing characters from `s` that completed sets of `k` unique characters; `cnt` is less than `n`; if the `i`-th bit of `cur` was 0, `tmp` is a character between 'a' and 'z' determined by `chr(ord('a') + i)`; `i` is 4 (assuming the previous value of i was 3)**.

To generalize, if the previous value of `i` was `x`, then the new value of `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input where `k` must be greater than 0; `s` is the newly read string from the input; `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively in `s`; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete set; `ans` is the string containing characters from `s` that completed sets of `k` unique characters; `cnt` is less than `n`; if the `i`-th bit of `cur` was 0, `tmp` is a character between 'a' and 'z' determined by `chr(ord('a') + i)`; `i` is incremented by 1**.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input where `k` must be greater than 0; `s` is the newly read string from the input; `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively in `s`; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete set; `ans` is the string containing characters from `s` that completed sets of `k` unique characters; `cnt` is less than `n`; if the `i`-th bit of `cur` was 0, `tmp` is a character between 'a' and 'z' determined by `chr(ord('a') + i)`; `i` is [previous value of i] + 1**.

Given the previous value of `i` was 3:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input where `k` must be greater than 0; `s` is the newly read string from the input; `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively in `s`; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete set; `ans` is the string containing characters from `s` that completed sets of `k` unique characters; `cnt` is less than `n`; if the `i`-th bit of `cur` was 0, `tmp` is a character between 'a' and 'z' determined by `chr(ord('a') + i)`; `i` is 4**.
