The given code snippet assigns a new character to the variable `tmp` based on the value of `i`. Specifically, `tmp` is set to the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus `i`. 

Given that the initial state does not specify a value for `i`, we cannot determine the exact character that `tmp` will hold. However, we know that `tmp` will be a character between `'a'` and `'z'` depending on the value of `i`.

Here's the updated state considering the impact of the code:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input where `k` must be greater than 0; `s` is the newly read string from the input; `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively in `s`; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete set; `ans` is the string containing characters from `s` that completed sets of `k` unique characters; `cnt` is less than `n`; `tmp` is a character between 'a' and 'z' determined by `chr(ord('a') + i)`; the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0**.

In simpler terms, `tmp` now holds a character from 'a' to 'z' based on the value of `i`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
