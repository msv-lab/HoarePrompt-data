Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `ss`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur` initially equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is updated to `s + ss`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
