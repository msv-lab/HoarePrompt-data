The given code snippet only modifies the variable `curr` by incrementing it by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers with `n > m`; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `b` minus the number of times it appeared in `a` (only if it was present in `b`), with `cnt_b[a[m + 1]]` incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is now 1 less than its previous value; `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `i` is `m + 1`; `curr` is adjusted based on the new value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and is now `curr + 1`; `ans` is set to 3 if `curr` (after adjustments) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is set to 1.**
