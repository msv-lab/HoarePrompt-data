The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Given that `i` is `m + 2`, the element `a[m + 2]` is accessed and its count in `cnt_b` is increased by 1.

Since `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`, the only change is in the count of `a[m + 2]` in `cnt_b`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`, and the count of `a[m + 2]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1; `n` is greater than `m`; `m` and `k` remain unchanged; `a` and `b` remain unchanged; `i` is `m + 2`; `b_values` remains unchanged.**
