To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `a`: This is a list, but its specific elements are not provided.
   - `i`: This is set to `n - 1`, meaning it points to the last index of a list with `n` elements.
   - `cnt_b`: This reflects the final count of elements in `b_values` found in the last `m` elements of `a`.
   - `curr`: This reflects the final count of unique elements from `b_values` in the last `m` elements of `a`.
   - `ans`: This is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` was greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `n`, `m`, `k`, `b_values`, and `b`: These remain unchanged throughout the process.

2. **Understanding the logic:**
   - The variable `ans` is incremented based on the condition that `curr` (the count of unique elements from `b_values` in the last `m` elements of `a`) is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `b_values`, and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.

3. **Output Description:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the final value of `ans`, which is determined by how many times the condition `curr >= k` was met during the iterations over the last `m` elements of `a`.

Given the above analysis, the final output will be described as follows:

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of times the count of unique elements from b_values in the last m elements of a was greater than or equal to k)**
