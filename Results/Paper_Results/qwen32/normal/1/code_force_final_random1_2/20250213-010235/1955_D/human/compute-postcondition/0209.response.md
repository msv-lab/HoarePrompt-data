The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decrements the count of `a[i + m]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1.

Given the initial state, `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. This means the count of `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is reduced by 1.

Since no other variables are modified in the given code snippet, the rest of the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` remains the same, `cnt_b` reflects decremented counts for elements in `b_values` found in the first `m` elements of `a` except for `a[i]` which has been incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`. `i` is `m-1`, `n` must be greater than `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged. Additionally, `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0 before the decrement, then `curr` is `curr - 1` and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
