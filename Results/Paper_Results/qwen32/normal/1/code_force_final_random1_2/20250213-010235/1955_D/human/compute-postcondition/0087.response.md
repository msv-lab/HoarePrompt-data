The given code reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `b`. This operation does not affect the previously defined variables `cnt_b`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a`.

Output State: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `b_values` and each value is `0`; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the three integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**
