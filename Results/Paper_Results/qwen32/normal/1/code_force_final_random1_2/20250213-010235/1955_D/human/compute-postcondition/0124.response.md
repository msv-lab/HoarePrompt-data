Postcondition: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`, where the count of `a[m]` has been incremented by 1. `n` is greater than `m`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is `m`, `b_values` remains unchanged. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` was greater than 0, `curr` is the previous value of `curr` minus 1. `ans` is 1 if the new value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` is 0.**
