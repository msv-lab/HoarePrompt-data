The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust only `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`.
- `i` is `m`.

Since the loop runs for `i` in `range(n - m)`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is `m + 1`, `b_values` remains unchanged, `curr` and `ans` remain unchanged**.
