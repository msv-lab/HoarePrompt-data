The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` remains the same.
- `cnt_b` reflects decremented counts for elements in `b_values` found in the first `m` elements of `a` except for `a[i]` which has been incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`.
- `i` is `m-1`.
- `n` must be greater than `m`.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `b_values` remains unchanged.
- `b` remains unchanged.
- If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

Since `i` was `m-1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The loop condition is `i` in the range `n - m`, so `i` should be `m` at the start of the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`a` remains the same, `cnt_b` reflects decremented counts for elements in `b_values` found in the first `m` elements of `a` except for `a[i]` which has been incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `i` is `m`, `n` must be greater than `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
