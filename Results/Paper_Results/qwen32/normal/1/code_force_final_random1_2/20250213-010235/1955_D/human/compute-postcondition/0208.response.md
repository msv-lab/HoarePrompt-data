Postcondition: **`a` remains the same, `cnt_b` reflects decremented counts for elements in `b_values` found in the first `m` elements of `a` except for `a[i]` which has been incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`. `i` is `m-1`, `n` must be greater than `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged. Additionally, `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than 0, then `curr` is `curr - 1` and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
