The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the value stored in the dictionary `cnt_b` at the key `a[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is `m-1`, the value at `a[m-1]` is used as the key in the dictionary `cnt_b`.

Output State: **`i` is `m-1`; `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` is decreased by 1.**

This means that the count associated with the element `a[m-1]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` has been reduced by one. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
