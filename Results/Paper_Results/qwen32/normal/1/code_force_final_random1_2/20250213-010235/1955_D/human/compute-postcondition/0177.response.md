The code snippet `b_values = set(b)` converts the list `b` into a set named `b_values`. This operation does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state. The set `b_values` will contain unique elements from the list `b`.

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers provided by the user input; `cnt_b` reflects the counts of elements from `b` in the last `m` elements of the original `a` except `cnt_b[i]` which is now `m` for `b[i]` (previously `m-1`); `i` is `m-1`; `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was `>= k` during the loop; `curr` is the count of elements in the last `m` elements of the original `a` that are in `b` and have non-negative counts in `cnt_b`; `n`, `m`, `k` are the input integers; `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`; `b` is a list of integers provided by the user input.**
