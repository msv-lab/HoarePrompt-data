The code snippet `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers with `n > m`; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `b` minus the number of times it appeared in `a` (only if it was present in `b`) minus 1 for the key `a[i + m]`; `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `i` is `m`; `curr` is the total number of elements from `a` that were found in `b` and had non-negative counts in `cnt_b` minus 1 if `a[i + m]` was in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0 before the decrement, plus 1; `ans` is set to 2 if `curr` (after potential decrement and increment) is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
