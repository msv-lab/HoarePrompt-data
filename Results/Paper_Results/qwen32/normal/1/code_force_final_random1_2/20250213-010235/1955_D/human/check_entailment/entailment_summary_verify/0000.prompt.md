You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers and two additional integers. For each test case, it determines how many contiguous subarrays of length `m` in the first list contain at least `k` elements that also appear in the second list. It then prints the count of such subarrays for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it resets the `cnt_b` array after processing each test case. The `cnt_b` array is used to keep track of the counts of elements in array `b`. However, after processing each test case, the program only resets the counts for elements that are in `b_values`, but it does not reset the counts for all possible values from 1 to `max_val`. This means that if a value that was not in `b` in one test case appears in `b` in a subsequent test case, its count might not be correctly initialized.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

```
2
5 3 2
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3
5 3 2
1 2 3 4 5
4 5 6
```

For the first test case, the `cnt_b` array will be `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, ...]` after processing `b = [1, 2, 3]`.

For the second test case, the program will not reset the counts for values 1, 2, and 3, so the `cnt_b` array will still be `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, ...]` before processing `b = [4, 5, 6]`. This means that the counts for 4, 5, and 6 will not be correctly initialized, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this issue, the program should reset the entire `cnt_b` array to zeros after processing each test case. Here is the corrected part of the code:

```python
def func():
    max_val = 1000000
    cnt_b = [0] * (max_val + 1)
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(m):
            cnt_b[b[i]] += 1
        b_values = set(b)
        ans = 0
        curr = 0
        for i in range(m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
        if curr >= k:
            ans += 1
        for i in range(n - m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
                    curr -= 1
            if a[i + m] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
            if curr >= k:
                ans += 1
        print(ans)
        cnt_b = [0] * (max_val + 1)  # Reset the entire cnt_b array for the next test case
```

With this change, the program should correctly handle all test cases.
