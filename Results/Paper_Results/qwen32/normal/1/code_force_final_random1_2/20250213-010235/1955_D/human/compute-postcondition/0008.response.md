The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's assume it is `x`), and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should now be `x + 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Therefore, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`. Given that we don't know the exact value of `x`, we can simply say that `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1; `i` is incremented by 1**
