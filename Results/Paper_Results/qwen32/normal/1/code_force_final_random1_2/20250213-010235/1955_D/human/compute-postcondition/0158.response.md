To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `cnt_b`: This is a dictionary (or similar structure) that keeps track of the counts of elements from `b` in the last `m` elements of `a`.
- `i`: This variable is set to `n`, but it does not directly affect the value of `ans`.
- `ans`: This variable holds the total number of times `curr` was `>= k` during the loop.
- `curr`: This variable represents the count of elements in the last `m` elements of `a` that are in `b` and have non-negative counts in `cnt_b`.
- `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `b_values`: These remain unchanged throughout the process.

Given this context, the `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.

Since the specific values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `b_values` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `ans`.

Therefore, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of times curr was >= k during the loop)**
