### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program and verify whether it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Count the number of subarrays of length `m` in array `a` that contain at least `k` elements which can be rearranged to match elements in array `b`.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - `1 <= t <= 10^4` (number of test cases).
   - `1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5` (sizes of arrays).
   - Elements in `a` and `b` are between `1` and `10^6`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `cnt_b`: An array of size `1000001` (to handle values up to `10^6`) initialized to `0`. This will store the count of each element in `b`.
   - For each test case, read `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - Read arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Counting Elements in `b`**:
   - Increment the count of each element in `b` in `cnt_b`.

3. **Initial Window**:
   - Consider the first window of size `m` in `a`.
   - For each element in this window, check if it exists in `b` using a set `b_values` for quick lookup.
   - If it exists, decrement its count in `cnt_b` and increment the `curr` counter if the count remains non-negative.

4. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - Slide the window one element to the right from `i` to `i+m-1` to `i+1` to `i+m`.
   - For the element that is sliding out (`a[i]`), if it was counted previously, increment its count in `cnt_b` and decrement `curr` if the count becomes positive.
   - For the new element that is sliding in (`a[i+m]`), perform the same checks and update `cnt_b` and `curr` accordingly.
   - After each slide, check if `curr` is at least `k`. If so, increment the answer `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - Print the number of good subarrays for each test case.

6. **Resetting Counts**:
   - Reset the counts in `cnt_b` for the next test case.

#### Verification:
- The program uses a sliding window approach, which is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) per test case, making it suitable for large inputs.
- The use of a set `b_values` ensures quick membership testing.
- The logic for updating `cnt_b` and `curr` correctly handles the addition and removal of elements in the sliding window.
- The program resets `cnt_b` after processing each test case, ensuring no carryover between tests.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem within the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
