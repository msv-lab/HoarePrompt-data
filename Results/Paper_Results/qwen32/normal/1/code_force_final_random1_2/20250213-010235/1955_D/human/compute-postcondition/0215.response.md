The given code snippet increments the variable `ans` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.

Output State: **`a` remains the same, `cnt_b` reflects decremented counts for elements in `b_values` found in the first `m` elements of `a` except for `a[i]` which has been incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`. `i` is `m-1`, `n` must be greater than `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `curr` is now greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 1.**
