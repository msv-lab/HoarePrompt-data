The code snippet `cnt_b[i] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the key `i` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `cnt_b` or the value of `i`, we can only infer that after this operation, `cnt_b` will have the key `i` with the value `0`. The precondition that `b_values` must be a non-empty iterable remains unchanged.

Output State: **`b_values` must be a non-empty iterable; `cnt_b[i]` is `0`.**
