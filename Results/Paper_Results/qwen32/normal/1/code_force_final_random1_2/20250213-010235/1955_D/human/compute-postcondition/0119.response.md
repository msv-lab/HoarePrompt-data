To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(n - m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we see that the only variable that can be adjusted is `i`. However, the problem statement already provides an initial value for `i` as `m`. Therefore, the loop will execute if and only if `n - m` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be greater than `m`.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- The loop will execute if `n > m`.
- The initial value of `i` is already given as `m`.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is ensuring that `n` is greater than `m`.

State: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`, `n` must be greater than `m`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is `m`, `b_values` remains unchanged, `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` remains 0, `curr` is the total number of elements from `a` within the first `m` elements that are also in `b` and have non-negative counts in `cnt_b`**.
