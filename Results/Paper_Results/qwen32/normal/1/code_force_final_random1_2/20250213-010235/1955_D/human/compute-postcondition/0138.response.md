Postcondition: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b` and an additional count for `a[m + 1]`. `n` is greater than `m`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is `m + 1`, `b_values` remains unchanged. If `cnt_b[a[i]] > 0`, then `curr` is decreased by 1. `ans` remains unchanged.**
