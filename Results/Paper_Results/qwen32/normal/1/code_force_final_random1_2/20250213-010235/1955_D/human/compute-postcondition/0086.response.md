The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The initial state of `cnt_b`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `b_values` and each value is `0`; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the three integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
