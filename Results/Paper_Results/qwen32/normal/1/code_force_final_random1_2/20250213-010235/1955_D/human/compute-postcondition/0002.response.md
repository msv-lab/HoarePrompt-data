In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the number of test cases, which is read from the input. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the range function with `int(input())` as its argument. This means the loop will execute as many times as the integer value read from the input.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value that determines the number of iterations. Since the problem states that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, we need to ensure that the input value is within this range.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once and at most 10,000 times, as required by the problem statement. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `max_val`, `cnt_b`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.
