Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem using a sliding window approach combined with frequency counting. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a counter array `cnt_b` to keep track of the frequency of each element in array `b`. This helps in efficiently checking how many elements in the current window of `a` match the elements in `b`.

2. **First Window**: It processes the first window of size `m` in array `a` and counts how many elements in this window are also in `b`. If this count (`curr`) is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

3. **Sliding Window**: For each subsequent window, it slides the window one position to the right:
   - It adjusts the count for the element that is leaving the window.
   - It adjusts the count for the element that is entering the window.
   - It checks if the new count of matching elements is greater than or equal to `k` and updates the answer accordingly.

4. **Output**: After processing all possible windows, it prints the answer for the current test case.

5. **Reset**: Before starting the next test case, it resets the counts for the elements in `b` to zero.

This approach ensures that the solution runs efficiently within the constraints, making use of the sliding window technique to avoid redundant calculations. Thus, the program is correct.
