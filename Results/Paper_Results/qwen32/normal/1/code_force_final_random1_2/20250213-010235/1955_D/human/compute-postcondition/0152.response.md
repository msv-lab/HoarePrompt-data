Output State: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`, and the count of `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is decremented by 1; `n` is greater than `m`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `b_values` remains unchanged; `curr` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `curr` is increased by 1. All other variables (`cnt_b`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `b_values`) retain their original values and states.
