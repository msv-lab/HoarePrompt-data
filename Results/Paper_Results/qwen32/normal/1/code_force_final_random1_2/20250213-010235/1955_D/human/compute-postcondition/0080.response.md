The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the key `i` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. This means that if `i` was already a key in `cnt_b`, its value is now `0`. If `i` was not a key in `cnt_b`, it is added with the value `0`.

Output State: **`b_values` must be a non-empty iterable; `i` is the next value in `b_values`; `cnt_b[i]` is `0`.**
