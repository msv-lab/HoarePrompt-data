### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program step-by-step to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a list `cnt_b` with size `max_val + 1` (where `max_val` is 1,000,000) to keep track of the counts of elements in array `b`.
   - This is efficient because it avoids using a dictionary and allows constant-time updates and lookups.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

3. **Counting Elements in `b`**:
   - It increments the count of each element in `b` in the `cnt_b` list.
   - It also creates a set `b_values` from `b` to quickly check if an element is in `b`.

4. **Initial Window Check**:
   - It checks the first subarray of length `m` in `a` to see how many elements are in `b` and adjusts the `cnt_b` list accordingly.
   - If the count of matching elements (`curr`) is at least `k`, it increments the answer (`ans`).

5. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - For each subsequent subarray of length `m` in `a` (by sliding the window one element to the right), it updates the count of elements entering and leaving the window.
   - It adjusts the `cnt_b` list and the `curr` count based on whether the elements entering and leaving the window are in `b`.
   - If the updated `curr` count is at least `k`, it increments the answer (`ans`).

6. **Output**:
   - After processing all subarrays for a test case, it prints the count of good subarrays.
   - It resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the next test case.

### Analysis:

- The program uses a sliding window approach to efficiently count the number of good subarrays. This approach ensures that each element of `a` is processed only twice (once when entering the window and once when leaving), making the solution efficient even for large inputs.
- The use of a set `b_values` and a list `cnt_b` ensures that membership checks and updates are performed in constant time, which is crucial given the constraints.
- The logic for updating the count of matching elements (`curr`) is correct and ensures that the program accurately counts the number of good subarrays.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently handles the constraints and provides the correct output for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
