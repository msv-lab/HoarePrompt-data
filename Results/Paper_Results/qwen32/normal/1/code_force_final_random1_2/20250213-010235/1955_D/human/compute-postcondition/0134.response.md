Postcondition: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if its original value was greater than or equal to 0, and `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than 0 before the decrement. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `curr`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `b_values` remain unchanged. `n` is greater than `m`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is `m`, `b_values` remains unchanged. If the current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2; otherwise, `ans` is 1.**
