The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`.
- If `a[m + 1]` is in `b_values`, an additional count for `a[m + 1]` is added to `cnt_b`.
- The count for `a[2m + 1]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1.
- If `a[i + m]` (which is `a[2m + 1]`) is in `b_values`, `curr` is increased by 1.
- `n` is greater than `m`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is `m + 1`, `b_values` remains unchanged.
- If `cnt_b[a[i]] > 0`, then `curr` is decreased by 1.
- If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `m + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`cnt_b` is a dictionary with updated counts of elements from `b` within the first `m` elements of `b`, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `i` is `m + 2`, `b_values` remains unchanged.**
