Postcondition: **`a` is a new list of integers provided by the user input, `cnt_b` reflects the counts of elements from `b` in the last `m` elements of the original `a` except `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` is now `m-2` if `a[m-1]` is in `b_values`. `i` is `m`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 2 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `curr` remains 1. `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` are the input integers, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, and `b` is a list of integers provided by the user input.**
