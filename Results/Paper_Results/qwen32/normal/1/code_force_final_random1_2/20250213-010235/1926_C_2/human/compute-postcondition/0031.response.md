Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for each `i` from 1 to 200000. For `i > t`, `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum up to `pd[t]` plus the sum of the digits of numbers from `t+1` to `i`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop complete, `pd[i]` will hold the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to `i` for every `i` from 1 to 200000. This means that for any index `i`, `pd[i]` will tell you the total sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 up to `i`. If `i` is greater than `t`, the value of `pd[i]` will continue to accumulate based on the sum of the digits of numbers from `t+1` to `i`.
