Let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
  - `N` is 200001.
  - `pd[t + 2]` is updated to `pd[t + 2] + int(str(t + 2)[0])`.
  - `i` is `t + 2`.
  - `j` is the first character of `str(t + 2)`.

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for j in str(i):
      # the loop body is omit
  ```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was set to the first character of `str(i)`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another character in `str(i)` to assign to `j`.

### Steps to Adjust the State:
1. **Determine the current value of `i`:**
   - From the state, `i` is `t + 2`.

2. **Convert `i` to a string:**
   - `str(i)` gives us the string representation of `i`.

3. **Identify the characters in `str(i)`:**
   - Since `j` was the first character in the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `str(i)` must have more than one character.

4. **Adjust `j` to the next character in `str(i)`:**
   - If `str(i)` has more than one character, the next character should be assigned to `j`.

### Example Adjustment:
- Suppose `t` is 999, then `i` is 1001.
- `str(i)` is "1001".
- In the previous iteration, `j` was '1' (the first character).
- For the next iteration, `j` should be '0' (the second character).

### General Adjustment:
- Since we don't know the exact value of `t`, we assume `str(i)` has more than one character.
- Therefore, `j` should be the next character in `str(i)`.

### Final State:
- `t` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.
- `N` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.
- `i` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.
- `j` is updated to the next character in `str(i)`.

### Conclusion:
State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd[t + 2]` is `pd[t + 2] + int(str(t + 2)[0])`, `i` is `t + 2`, `j` is the second character of `str(t + 2)`**
