In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head contains the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times, and `t` is the number of iterations.

To ensure that the loop executes, the value of `t` must be at least 1. The variable `N` and the list `pd` are not directly involved in controlling the execution of this loop; they are part of the program state but not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `t` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `t` is already described as an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, it should already satisfy this condition. However, if we strictly follow the instruction to adjust the state based on the loop head, we would ensure `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for each `i` from 1 to 200000. For `i > t`, `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum up to `pd[t]` plus the sum of the digits of numbers from `t+1` to `i`, and `t` must be at least 1**. 

However, since `t` is already guaranteed to be between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, the final state can be simplified to:

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for each `i` from 1 to 200000. For `i > t`, `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum up to `pd[t]` plus the sum of the digits of numbers from `t+1` to `i`**.
