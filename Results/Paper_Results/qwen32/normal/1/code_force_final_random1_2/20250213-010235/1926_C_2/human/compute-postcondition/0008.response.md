Given the initial state, `num` is a non-zero integer such that \(0 < \text{num} < 2 \cdot 10^4\), and `a` is the sum of the last two digits of the original `num`. The code snippet modifies `a` by adding the last digit of `num` to it.

Let's break down the changes:

- `a` was initially the sum of the last two digits of `num`.
- `num % 10` gives the last digit of `num`.
- The new value of `a` is the sum of its previous value and the last digit of `num`.

Therefore, the new value of `a` is the sum of the last two digits of `num` plus the last digit of `num`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-zero integer such that \(0 < \text{num} < 2 \cdot 10^4\); `a` is the sum of the last two digits of the original `num` plus the last digit of `num`.**
