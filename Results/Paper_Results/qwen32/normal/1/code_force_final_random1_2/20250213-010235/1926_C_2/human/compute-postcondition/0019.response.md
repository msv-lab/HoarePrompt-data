Let's analyze the given task step-by-step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for j in str(i):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```
   Here, the variable `j` is being iterated over the string representation of `i`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
   - `N` is 200001.
   - `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[1]` is `2 * int(j)` and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1, so `str(i)` is `"1"`.
   - The loop has already processed the first (and only) character `"1"` in the string `"1"`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is 1 and `str(1)` is `"1"`, there is only one character in the string.
   - After processing this character, the loop would normally terminate because there are no more characters to process.

Given these points, the loop cannot execute another iteration because there are no more characters in `str(i)` to iterate over.

Therefore, the state does not change for another iteration of the loop. The final state remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[1]` is `2 * int(j)` and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than 1, `i` is 1**
