To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's carefully analyze the given information and the behavior of the loop.

### Analysis of the Loop:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `t`: An input integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `N`: A constant value of 200001.
   - `pd`: A list of 200001 elements initialized to 0. The first `t` elements will be updated based on the sum of the digits of numbers from 1 to `t`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each `i` from 1 to `t`, the loop iterates over each digit `j` in the string representation of `i`.
   - It adds the integer value of `j` to `pd[i]`.

3. **Cumulative Sum Update:**
   - After the inner loop (which processes each digit of `i`), `pd[i]` contains the sum of the digits of `i`.
   - This value is then used in subsequent iterations to update `pd` for larger values of `i`.

### Given Output States:
- **After 1 iteration (`i = 1`):**
  - `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of 1, which is 1.
  
- **After 2 iterations (`i = 2`):**
  - `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of 1, which is 1.
  - `pd[2]` is the sum of the digits of 2, which is 2.
  
- **After 3 iterations (`i = 3`):**
  - `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of 1, which is 1.
  - `pd[2]` is the sum of the digits of 2, which is 2.
  - `pd[3]` is the sum of the digits of 3, which is 3.

### General Pattern:
- For each `i` from 1 to `t`, `pd[i]` will be the sum of the digits of `i`.
- Elements `pd[i]` for `i > t` remain 0.

### Final Output State:
- `pd[i]` for `i` from 1 to `t` will contain the sum of the digits of `i`.
- `pd[i]` for `i > t` will remain 0.
- `i` will be equal to `t + 1` after the loop completes.

### Conclusion:
The final output state of the loop can be described as follows:

**Output State:** `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of `i` for `i` from 1 to `t`, and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than `t`, `i` is `t + 1`.

Output State: **t is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, N is 200001, pd is a list of 200001 elements where pd[i] is the sum of the digits of i for i from 1 to t, and pd[i] is 0 for i greater than t, i is t + 1.**
