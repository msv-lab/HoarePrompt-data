To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop iterates over each digit of the integer `i` (which starts as `t + 2`) and adds each digit to `pd[i]`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
   - `N` is 200001.
   - `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of `i` for `i` from 1 to `t`. For `i` greater than `t`, `pd[i]` is 0, except `pd[t + 2]` which is initially `pd[t + 2] + pd[t + 1]`.
   - `i` is initialized to `t + 2`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each character `j` in the string representation of `i`.
   - For each character `j`, it converts `j` to an integer and adds it to `pd[i]`.

Since `i` is `t + 2`, the loop will iterate over each digit of the number `t + 2` and add these digits to `pd[t + 2]`.

After all iterations, `pd[t + 2]` will be the sum of the digits of `t + 2`.

### Final Output State

- `t` remains the same input integer.
- `N` remains 200001.
- `pd` will have `pd[t + 2]` updated to the sum of the digits of `t + 2`.
- All other elements of `pd` remain unchanged.
- `i` remains `t + 2`.

Thus, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of `i` for `i` from 1 to `t`, and `pd[t + 2]` is the sum of the digits of `t + 2`, `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than `t` except `pd[t + 2]`, `i` is `t + 2`.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes executing, `pd[t + 2]` will contain the sum of the digits of the number `t + 2`, while all other elements of `pd` remain unchanged. The value of `t`, `N`, and `i` also remain unchanged.
