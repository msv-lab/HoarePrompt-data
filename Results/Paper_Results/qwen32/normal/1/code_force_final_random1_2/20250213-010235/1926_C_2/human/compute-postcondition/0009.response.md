The code `num = int(num / 10)` divides the variable `num` by 10 and then converts the result to an integer, effectively removing the last digit of `num`.

Given the initial state:
- `num` is a non-zero integer such that \(0 < \text{num} < 2 \cdot 10^4\).
- `a` is the sum of the last two digits of the original `num` plus the last digit of `num`.

After executing the code, `num` will be the integer part of the division of the original `num` by 10. The value of `a` remains unchanged because it was calculated based on the original `num` and does not depend on subsequent changes to `num`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`num` is the integer part of the original `num` divided by 10; `a` is the sum of the last two digits of the original `num` plus the last digit of the original `num`.**
