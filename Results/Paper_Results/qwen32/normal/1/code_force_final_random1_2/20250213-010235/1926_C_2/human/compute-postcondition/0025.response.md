The code snippet provided modifies the value of `pd[i]` by adding the integer value of `j` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is `t + 2`, and `pd[i]` was previously `pd[t + 2] + pd[t + 1]`. After executing the code, `pd[i]` will be updated to `pd[t + 2] + pd[t + 1] + int(j)`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the sum of the digits of `i` for `i` from 1 to `t`, and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than `t` except `pd[t + 2]` which is now `pd[t + 2] + pd[t + 1] + int(j)`, `i` is `t + 2`**.
