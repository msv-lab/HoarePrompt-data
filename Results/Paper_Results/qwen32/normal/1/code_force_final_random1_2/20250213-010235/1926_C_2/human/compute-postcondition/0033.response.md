Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for each `i` from 1 to 200000. For `i > t`, `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum up to `pd[t]` plus the sum of the digits of numbers from `t+1` to `i`; `n` is an input integer.**

Natural Language: The variable `n` is now assigned the value of an input integer. The values of `t`, `N`, and `pd` remain unchanged.
