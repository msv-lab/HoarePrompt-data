The code snippet decrements the value of `tc` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `tc` is at least 1 (since it was at least 2 initially), `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end and must have at least 3 elements, `dp` is `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`, `n` is `len(arr) - 1` where `len(arr) > 2`, and `i` is `n-1`.**
