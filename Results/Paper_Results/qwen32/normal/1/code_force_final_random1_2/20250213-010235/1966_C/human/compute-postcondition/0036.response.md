The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is at least 1, `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end and must have at least 3 elements, `dp` is `True` if `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1` else `False`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1 (at least 2), `i` is 2**
