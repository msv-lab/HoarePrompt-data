Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 0, and for each test case, the output is either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the condition evaluated in the loop.**

### Explanation in Natural Language:

After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the following holds true:

- The variable `t`, which represents some initial integer within the range 1 to 10,000, remains unchanged.
- The variable `tc`, which initially represented the number of test cases, is now 0 because the loop decrements `tc` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
- For each test case, the program has processed the input list of integers, removed duplicates, sorted them in descending order, and appended a `0` at the end.
- The program then evaluates whether there are any consecutive elements in the sorted list (excluding the appended `0`) that have a difference of 1 or less. If such a pair exists, `dp` becomes `False`; otherwise, it remains `True`.
- Based on the final value of `dp`, the program prints 'Alice' if `dp` is `True` and 'Bob' if `dp` is `False`.

Thus, the loop has completed processing all test cases, and the output for each test case has been determined and printed.
