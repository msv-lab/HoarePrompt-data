To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

The given for loop is:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute if there are values of `i` starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `tc` is at least 1.
- `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end and must have at least 3 elements.
- `dp` is `True`.
- `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1 (at least 2).
- `i` is `n-1`.

Given that `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1 and `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `n` is at least 2. This means the loop can execute because `n` is greater than 1.

However, the initial value of `i` is `n-1`, which would place `i` outside the range `[1, n)` when the loop starts. To ensure the loop executes, `i` should be initialized to a value within the range `[1, n)`. The typical starting value for `i` in this context would be 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is set to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is at least 1, `arr` is a new list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end and must have at least 3 elements, `dp` is `True`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1 (at least 2), `i` is 1**
