Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is at least 1 and now `tc` is `tc - 1`, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end, `dp` is the result of the condition `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp` after the last iteration, `n` is len(arr) - 1, and `i` is n-1.**

Natural Language: The value of `tc` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
