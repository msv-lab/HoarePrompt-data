The given code snippet only contains a single line that assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `dp`. None of the other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `arr`) are affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tc` is at least 1; For each test case, `n` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end; `dp` is True.**
