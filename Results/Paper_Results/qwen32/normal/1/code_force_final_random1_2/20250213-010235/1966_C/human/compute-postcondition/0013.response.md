To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the logic involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases, but it does not directly influence the current print statement.
2. **`tc`**: At least 1. This likely represents the current test case number, but it also does not directly influence the current print statement.
3. **`arr`**: A list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end.
4. **`dp`**: The result of the condition `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp` after the last iteration.
5. **`n`**: The length of `arr` minus 1.
6. **`i`**: Set to `n-1`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
```

This means that the output depends on the value of `dp`:
- If `dp` is `True`, the output will be `'Alice'`.
- If `dp` is `False`, the output will be `'Bob'`.

### Determining the Value of `dp`:
The value of `dp` is determined by the condition:
```python
arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp
```

Let's analyze this condition step-by-step:
- `arr[n-2]` is the second-to-last element of the list `arr`.
- `arr[n-1]` is the last element of the list `arr`, which is `0` because a `0` is appended at the end of the list.
- The condition checks if the difference between the second-to-last element and the last element (`0`) is greater than `1`, or if `dp` is `False`.

Since `arr[n-1]` is always `0`:
- `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1` simplifies to `arr[n-2] > 1`.

Therefore, the condition can be rewritten as:
```python
arr[n-2] > 1 or not dp
```

This means:
- If `arr[n-2] > 1`, the condition is `True`.
- If `arr[n-2] <= 1`, the condition depends on the value of `dp`.

However, without knowing the exact values of `arr` and the initial value of `dp`, we cannot definitively determine the value of `dp` after the last iteration. But we can express the output in terms of `dp`.

### Final Output:
Based on the analysis, the output will be either `'Alice'` or `'Bob'` depending on the value of `dp` after the last iteration.

Output: **'Alice' if dp is True else 'Bob' (where dp is the result of the condition `arr[n-2] > 1 or not dp` after the last iteration)**
