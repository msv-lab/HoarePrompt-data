The given code processes a list of integers by first converting them into a set to remove duplicates, then sorting the unique integers in descending order, and finally appending a `0` to the end of the sorted list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `tc` is at least 1
- For each test case, `n` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5
- A list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5

After executing the code snippet:
- The list of integers read from input is converted to a set to eliminate duplicates.
- This set is then sorted in descending order.
- A `0` is appended to the end of this sorted list.
- The resulting list is stored in the variable `arr`.

The values of `t`, `tc`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tc` is at least 1; For each test case, `n` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input list, sorted in descending order with a `0` appended at the end.**
