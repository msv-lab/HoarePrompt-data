The code snippet modifies the list `pd` by adding the value of `pd[i-1]` to `pd[i]`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, we assume `i` was already initialized to some value before this line of code was executed.

Since `pd[i]` is initially the sum of the digits of `i` (for `i` from 1 to `t`), and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than `t`, the operation `pd[i] += pd[i - 1]` accumulates the sum of the sums of digits from `pd[1]` to `pd[i-1]` into `pd[i]`.

Therefore, after the operation, `pd[i]` will hold the cumulative sum of the sums of digits from `pd[1]` up to `pd[i-1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the sums of digits from `pd[1]` to `pd[i-1]` for each `i` from 2 to `t`, and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than `t`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
