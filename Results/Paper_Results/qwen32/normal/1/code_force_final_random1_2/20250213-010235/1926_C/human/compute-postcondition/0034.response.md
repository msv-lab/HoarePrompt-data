To determine the output of the `print(pd[n])` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand how the `pd` list is constructed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
2. **`N`**: A constant integer set to 200001.
3. **`pd`**: A list of 200001 elements where:
   - `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for each `i` from 1 to 200000.
   - For `i > t`, `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum up to `pd[t]` plus the sum of the digits of numbers from `t+1` to `i`.
4. **`n`**: Another input integer.

### Understanding `pd` List Construction:
- For `i` from 1 to `t`, `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`.
- For `i` greater than `t`, `pd[i]` is `pd[t]` plus the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from `t+1` to `i`.

### Determining the Output:
Given the above construction, the value of `pd[n]` depends on whether `n` is less than or equal to `t` or greater than `t`.

#### Case 1: \( n \leq t \)
- `pd[n]` is simply the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

#### Case 2: \( n > t \)
- `pd[n]` is `pd[t]` plus the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from `t+1` to `n`.

Since the exact values of `t` and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `pd[n]`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the conditions:

### Final Output Description:
- If `n` is less than or equal to `t`, `pd[n]` is the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`.
- If `n` is greater than `t`, `pd[n]` is `pd[t]` plus the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from `t+1` to `n`.

Thus, the output of the `print(pd[n])` statement is described as follows:

Output: **pd[n] (where pd[n] is the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from 1 to n if n <= t, or pd[t] plus the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from t+1 to n if n > t)**
