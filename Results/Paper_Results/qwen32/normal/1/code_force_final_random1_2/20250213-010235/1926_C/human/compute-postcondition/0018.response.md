The code snippet `pd[i] += int(j)` modifies the value of `pd[i]` by adding the integer value of `j` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `pd[1]` is being updated.

Initially, `pd[1]` is set to `int(j)`. After executing the line `pd[i] += int(j)`, which is equivalent to `pd[1] += int(j)`, the new value of `pd[1]` will be `int(j) + int(j)`, or simply `2 * int(j)`.

The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged. Specifically, `t` remains an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `N` remains 200001, `pd` remains a list of 200001 elements where `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the sums of digits from `pd[1]` to `pd[i-1]` for each `i` from 2 to `t`, and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[1]` is `2 * int(j)` and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than 1, `i` is 1.**
