The code snippet `a = a + num % 10` modifies the value of `a` by adding the last digit of `num` to it. Since `a` was initially the last digit of the original `num`, after the operation, `a` will be the sum of the last two digits of the original `num`.

Given that `num` is a non-zero integer such that \(0 < \text{num} < 2 \cdot 10^5\) (after removing the last digit), and `a` is the last digit of the original `num`, the new value of `a` will be the sum of the last two digits of the original `num`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-zero integer such that \(0 < \text{num} < 2 \cdot 10^5\) (after removing the last digit); `a` is the sum of the last two digits of the original `num`.**
