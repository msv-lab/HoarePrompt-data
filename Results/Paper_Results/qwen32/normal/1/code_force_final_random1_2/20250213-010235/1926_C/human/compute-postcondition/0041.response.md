Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for each `i` from 1 to 200000. For `i > t`, `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum up to `pd[t]` plus the sum of the digits of numbers from `t+1` to `i`. The loop has executed `t` times, with `n` being the last input integer during the final iteration.`**

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations (which is `t` times), the state remains the same as described initially, except that the loop has now processed `t` input integers `n`, printing the corresponding `pd[n]` for each one. The variables `t`, `N`, and `pd` retain their initial definitions and values, and `n` holds the value of the last input integer processed by the loop.
