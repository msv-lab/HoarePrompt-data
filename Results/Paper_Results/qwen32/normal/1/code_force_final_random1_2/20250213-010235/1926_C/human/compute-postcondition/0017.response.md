The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which iterates over the characters in the string representation of `i`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `j` and how it changes as the loop progresses.

Given:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
- `N` is 200001.
- `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the sums of digits from `pd[1]` to `pd[i-1]` for each `i` from 2 to `t`, and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than `t`.
- `i` is 1.
- `pd[1]` is `int(j)`.
- The loop iterates over `j` in `str(i)`.

Since `i` is 1, `str(i)` is `"1"`, and the loop will iterate over this single character. After the first (and only) iteration, the loop will terminate because there are no more characters in the string `"1"` to iterate over.

Therefore, there is no next iteration to prepare for in this specific case. However, if we were to generalize the process for any `i`:

1. Convert `i` to its string representation.
2. Iterate over each character `j` in this string.
3. After each iteration, `j` takes on the next character in the string.

Since `i` is currently 1 and the loop has already completed its iteration over the single character `"1"`, there is no adjustment needed for `j` because the loop will not execute again with `i = 1`.

However, if we hypothetically consider the state right before the loop starts for `i = 1`:

- `i` is 1.
- `j` is about to take the first character of `str(i)`, which is `"1"`.

So, the state right before the loop starts for `i = 1` would be:

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the sums of digits from `pd[1]` to `pd[i-1]` for each `i` from 2 to `t`, and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than `t`, `i` is 1, `pd[1]` is `int(j)`, `j` is the first character of `str(i)`**

But since the loop has already completed for `i = 1`, there is no next iteration to set up. The loop will not run again with `i = 1`.

Thus, the final answer considering the current state is:

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 elements where `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the sums of digits from `pd[1]` to `pd[i-1]` for each `i` from 2 to `t`, and `pd[i]` is 0 for `i` greater than `t`, `i` is 1, `pd[1]` is `int(j)`**

Since there is no next iteration, we don't need to adjust `j` further.
