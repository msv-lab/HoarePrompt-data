The value of `num` is updated to be the integer division of its current value by 10, effectively removing the last digit. The variable `a` retains its value as the last digit of the original `num`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 0 ≤ num < 2 · 10^5 (after removing the last digit); `a` is the last digit of the original `num`.**
