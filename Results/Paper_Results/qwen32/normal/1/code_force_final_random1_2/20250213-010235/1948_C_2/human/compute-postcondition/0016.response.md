Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input strings, `i` is 5 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `break` statement is that it exits the most internal loop or if statement.
