In the given initial state, several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) are described, but they do not affect the execution of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement directly outputs the string `'No'`, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
