To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop based on the provided conditions and the given outputs after the first three iterations.

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` with a step of 2 (`for i in range(1, n, 2)`).
- For each iteration, it checks if either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` and `i + 1 < n`, or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`.
- If either condition is met, it prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
- If none of these conditions are met throughout all iterations, it prints "Yes" after the loop completes.

### Given Outputs:
- After the first iteration (`i = 1`), the loop did not break.
- After the second iteration (`i = 3`), the loop did not break.
- After the third iteration (`i = 5`), the loop did not break.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop did not break after the first three iterations, we can infer that the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` and `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` were not met for `i = 1`, `i = 3`, and `i = 5`. This means that for these values of `i`, the characters in `a` and `b` at the specified positions were not both '<'.

If this pattern continues until the loop finishes all its iterations (i.e., no other pair of positions `i` and `i+1` or `i` and `i-1` meet the breaking condition), the loop will complete all iterations without breaking, and it will print "Yes".

### Final Output State:
Output State: **the loop completes all iterations without breaking, and it prints "Yes".**

In natural language: The loop runs through all its iterations without finding any pair of positions where both `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are '<'. Therefore, after all iterations, it prints "Yes".
