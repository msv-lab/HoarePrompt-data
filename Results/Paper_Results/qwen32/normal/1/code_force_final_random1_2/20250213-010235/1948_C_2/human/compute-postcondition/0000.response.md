`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` is now a specific integer between 1 and 10^4. The conditions for `n` and the strings remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; the first and second lines of each test case contain strings of length `n` consisting only of '<' and '>' characters; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
