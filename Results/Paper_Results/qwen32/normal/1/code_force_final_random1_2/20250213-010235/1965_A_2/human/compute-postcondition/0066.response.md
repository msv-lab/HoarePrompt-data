Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is another input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bob')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'Bob'`. It does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, regardless of the values of these variables, the output will always be the same.

### Final Output:
Output: **Bob**
