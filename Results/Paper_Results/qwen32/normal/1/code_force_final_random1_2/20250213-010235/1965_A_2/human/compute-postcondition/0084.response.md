The code snippet `lis = sorted(set(l))` updates the `lis` variable by first converting the map object `l` into a set to remove duplicates, and then sorting the resulting set to create a sorted list of unique integers.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `lis`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the newly input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
