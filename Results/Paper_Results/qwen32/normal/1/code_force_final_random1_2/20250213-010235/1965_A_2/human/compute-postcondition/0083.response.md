The code snippet reassigns the variable `l` to a new map object that contains integers from the split input. This means that the previous value of `l` (which was a map object containing integers from the split input) is replaced with a new map object containing integers from the next split input.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lis`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the newly input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from the previous `l`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
