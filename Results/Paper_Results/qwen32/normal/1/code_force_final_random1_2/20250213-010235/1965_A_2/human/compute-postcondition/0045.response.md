The given code snippet updates the `lis` variable by reassigning it to a sorted list of unique integers from the `l` map object. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and the condition related to `lis`) remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code.

Here's the detailed output state:

- `t` is still an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is still the new input integer.
- `l` is still a map object containing integers from the split input.
- `lis` is now a sorted list of unique integers from `l`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The condition related to `lis` (whether 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1) needs to be re-evaluated based on the new `lis`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
