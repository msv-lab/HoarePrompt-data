Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

1. **Variables and their descriptions:**
   - `t`: An integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases.
   - `n`: Another integer input.
   - `l`: A map object containing integers from a newly split input. This implies that `l` is an iterable of integers.
   - `lis`: A sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element. This means `lis` is a list with at least two distinct integers, and these integers are sorted in ascending order.
   - `i`: This variable is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`). However, it is not used in the print statement, so its value is irrelevant here.
   - `test`: A boolean variable set to `True`. Again, this variable is not used in the print statement, so its value is also irrelevant here.
   - `j`: An index variable that is even, and the difference between the `j`-th element and the `(j-1)`-th element in `lis` is greater than 1. This condition specifies a particular relationship between elements in `lis` but does not affect the print statement directly.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is simply `print('Alice')`.

Given the above analysis, the print statement will output the string `'Alice'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, `test`, or `j`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **Alice**
