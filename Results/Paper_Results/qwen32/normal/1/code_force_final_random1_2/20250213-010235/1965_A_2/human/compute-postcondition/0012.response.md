The given code snippet simply flips the boolean value of the variable `A`. Since the initial state specifies that `A` is `False`, executing `A = not A` will change `A` to `True`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements where the first element `t` is 1, followed by a unique set of integers representing the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile without duplicates. If the difference between the current element `set_[i]` and the previous element `set_[i - 1]` is greater than 1, `A` is True and `not_c` is False. Otherwise, `A` is True and `not_c` remains True.**
