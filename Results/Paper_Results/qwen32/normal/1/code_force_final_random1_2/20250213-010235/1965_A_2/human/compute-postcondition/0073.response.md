Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `j` is `len(lis) - 1`; `test` is `True`, indicating no pair with a difference greater than 1 was found during the loop.**
