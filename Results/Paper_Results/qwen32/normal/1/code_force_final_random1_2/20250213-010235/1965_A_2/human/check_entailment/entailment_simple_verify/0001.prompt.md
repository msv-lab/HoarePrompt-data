You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - Players take turns removing stones.
   - On each turn, they remove `k` stones from each non-empty pile, where `k` is at most the size of the smallest pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Winning Strategy:**
   - This game is a variant of the Nim game, specifically a misère Nim game with a twist due to the removal rule.
   - The key insight is to understand the parity (odd/even) of the number of piles with odd stones.
   - If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy.
   - If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is even, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy.

3. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles and their respective stone counts.
   - It then calls `func_1(arr)` to determine the winner.

4. **Evaluating `func_1(arr)`:**
   - The function starts by checking if the first element of the array is not 1. If true, it returns 'Alice'. This is incorrect because the winning condition depends on the parity of odd-numbered piles, not just the first pile.
   - It creates a set from the array and sorts it.
   - It then iterates through the sorted set to check if the difference between consecutive elements is more than 1. This logic is flawed and does not correctly determine the winner based on the game rules.
   - The variable `A` is toggled based on the differences, but this does not accurately reflect the winning strategy for the game.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the number of piles with an odd number of stones.
   - The logic used in `func_1` is incorrect and does not align with the optimal strategy for the game.
