To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `j` and the range function parameters.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the range function must generate at least one value. This means that the length of `lis` must be greater than 1, because `range(1, len(lis))` will only produce values if `len(lis)` is greater than 1 (since the start of the range is 1).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `j`:** This variable is the loop control variable and will be automatically set to the first value in the range when the loop starts. We don't need to adjust its initial state directly.

2. **Range Parameters:**
   - The start of the range is fixed at 1.
   - The end of the range is `len(lis)`. For the loop to execute, `len(lis)` must be greater than 1.

Given these points, the only variable that needs adjustment in the context of the loop head is `lis`. Specifically, `lis` must contain more than one element.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the newly input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `test` is `True`**

This ensures that the loop can execute by guaranteeing that `len(lis)` is greater than 1.
