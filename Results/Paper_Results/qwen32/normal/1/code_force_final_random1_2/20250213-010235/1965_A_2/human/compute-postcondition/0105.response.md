Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is another input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from a new split input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with more than one element.
- `i` and `j` are incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1` and `j = j + 1`).
- There is a conditional check inside a loop or if statement where if `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, `test` is set to False and the loop or if statement breaks.
- The `print('Bob')` statement is outside of this conditional logic.

### Analysis:
- The `print('Bob')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, `j`, or `test`.
- The `print('Bob')` statement will execute regardless of the conditions inside the loop or if statement because it is placed outside of any conditional blocks or loops.

### Conclusion:
The `print('Bob')` statement will simply print "Bob" to the console.

Output: **Bob**
