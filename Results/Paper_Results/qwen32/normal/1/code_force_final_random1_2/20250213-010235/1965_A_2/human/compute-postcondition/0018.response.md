To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `set_`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements where the first element `t` is 1, followed by a unique set of integers representing the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile without duplicates.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `A` is False.
- `not_c` is False if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, otherwise `not_c` is True. If `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, len(set_)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means that `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `len(set_) - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again.

Since `set_` is not modified within the loop head, its state remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `set_` remains unchanged.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements where the first element `t` is 1, followed by a unique set of integers representing the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile without duplicates; `i` is `i + 1`; `A` is False; `not_c` is False if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, otherwise `not_c` is True; `set_` remains the same.**

However, to be precise about the increment of `i`:
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements where the first element `t` is 1, followed by a unique set of integers representing the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile without duplicates; `i` is `i + 2`; `A` is False; `not_c` is False if `set_[i + 1] - set_[i] > 1`, otherwise `not_c` is True; `set_` remains the same.**

So the final answer is:
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements where the first element `t` is 1, followed by a unique set of integers representing the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile without duplicates; `i` is `i + 2`; `A` is False; `not_c` is False if `set_[i + 1] - set_[i] > 1`, otherwise `not_c` is True; `set_` remains the same.**

But since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the correct state should be:
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements where the first element `t` is 1, followed by a unique set of integers representing the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile without duplicates; `i` is `i + 1`; `A` is False; `not_c` is False if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, otherwise `not_c` is True; `set_` remains the same.**

Therefore, the correct state is:
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements where the first element `t` is 1, followed by a unique set of integers representing the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile without duplicates; `i` is `i + 1`; `A` is False; `not_c` is False if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, otherwise `not_c` is True; `set_` remains the same.**

Simplified:
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements where the first element `t` is 1, followed by a unique set of integers representing the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile without duplicates; `i` is `i + 1`; `A` is False; `not_c` is determined by `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`; `set_` remains the same.**
