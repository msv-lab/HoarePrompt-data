Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If 1 is not in `lis` or `lis` has only one element, the conditions remain as stated. Otherwise, `j` is set to `len(lis) - 1` and `test` is `True`, indicating no pair with a difference greater than 1 was found during the loop.**
