The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the new input integer
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value

We only need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

To be more specific, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 4 at the start of the next iteration. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`) remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `i` is 4** (assuming `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration).

In general, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `i` is `i + 1`**
