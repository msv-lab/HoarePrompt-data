Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `j` is `j + 1`. The behavior does not depend on whether `j` is odd or even; the same changes occur in both cases.**
