To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states for the first three iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to the length of `set_` (which is the same as `arr` since `set_` is not defined separately in the context, we assume it's `arr`).
- For each iteration `i`, it checks if the difference between the current element `arr[i]` and the previous element `arr[i - 1]` is greater than 1.
- If the condition is met (`arr[i] - arr[i - 1] > 1`), `not_c` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
- If the condition is not met, `A` is toggled (i.e., `A` becomes `not A`).

### Iteration Analysis:
- **After 1st iteration**: `A` is `True` and `not_c` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether `arr[1] - arr[0] > 1`.
- **After 2nd iteration**: `A` is `False` and `not_c` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether `arr[2] - arr[1] > 1`.
- **After 3rd iteration**: `A` is `True` and `not_c` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether `arr[3] - arr[2] > 1`.

### General Pattern:
- `A` alternates between `True` and `False` with each iteration.
- `not_c` remains `True` unless a difference greater than 1 is found, which causes `not_c` to become `False` and the loop to terminate early.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will continue until `i` reaches `len(arr) - 1` or `not_c` becomes `False` due to a difference greater than 1.
- Since `A` alternates with each iteration, after an even number of iterations, `A` will be `False`, and after an odd number of iterations, `A` will be `True`.
- `not_c` will be `False` if any difference greater than 1 is encountered during the iterations; otherwise, it will remain `True`.

### Conclusion:
- If the loop completes all iterations without finding any difference greater than 1, `A` will be `False` if the number of iterations is even, and `True` if the number of iterations is odd.
- `not_c` will be `True` if no differences greater than 1 are found; otherwise, it will be `False`.

Assuming the loop completes all iterations without breaking early (i.e., no differences greater than 1 are found):

- The number of iterations is `len(arr) - 1`.
- If `len(arr) - 1` is even, `A` will be `False`.
- If `len(arr) - 1` is odd, `A` will be `True`.
- `not_c` will be `True`.

Let's assume `len(arr) - 1` is even for a general case (since the specific length of `arr` isn't provided, we can consider both cases, but typically, we'd need the length to be concrete).

Thus, the final output state would be:

Output State: **arr is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements where the first element t is 1, followed by a unique set of integers representing the number of piles n and the initial number of stones in each pile without duplicates; A is False; not_c is True.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing all its iterations without encountering any differences greater than 1, the variable `A` will be `False`, and `not_c` will remain `True`. The list `arr` will still be a sorted list of integers starting with 1, followed by unique integers representing the number of stones in each pile.
