In this case, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head only contains the variable `_` (which is a common Python convention for a throwaway variable) and the result of `int(input())`. The state at the end of the previous iteration does not provide any information about the value of `int(input())` directly, but it implies that the loop is iterating based on some input value.

Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, its value doesn't matter for the continuation of the loop. The only thing that matters for the loop to execute again is the number of iterations left, which is determined by the value of `int(input())`.

Given that the loop is controlled by the number of times specified by the input, and since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, we don't need to adjust any variables other than ensuring that the loop counter still allows for another iteration.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not specify how many iterations are left, we assume that there was at least one iteration left when the previous iteration ended. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the number of remaining iterations must be decremented by 1.

However, since we don't have the exact number of remaining iterations, we can only describe the state in terms of the decrement of the iteration count.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` after the corresponding iteration, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the calculations. The number of remaining iterations for the loop is decremented by 1.**

Since the loop variable `_` is not relevant to the state, we do not include it in the state description.

Final State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` after the corresponding iteration, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the calculations.**
