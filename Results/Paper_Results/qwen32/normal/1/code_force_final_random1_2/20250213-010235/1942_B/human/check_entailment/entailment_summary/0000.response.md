### Reasoning:

The program aims to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the given array `a` based on the relationship \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the program:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, the program initializes an empty result list `res` of size `n` and sets `mex` to `n`. The `mex` variable represents the current MEX value, which starts at `n` because initially, no numbers are in the permutation.

2. **Reverse Iteration**: The program iterates through the array `a` in reverse order. This reverse iteration is crucial because it allows us to determine the value of `p_i` by using the already computed MEX values for subsequent elements.

3. **Determine `p_i`**: For each element `ar[i]` in the reversed array `a`, the program calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`. This formula comes directly from the given relationship \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \), rearranged to solve for `p_i`.

4. **Update `mex`**: After determining `res[i]`, the program updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `mex - ar[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet included in the permutation `p`.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the reconstructed permutation `p` for each test case.

The logic appears sound and correctly implements the reverse reconstruction process. Given that the problem guarantees at least one valid permutation exists for the input, this approach should work correctly for all valid inputs.
