Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's determine the output state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 1 element.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`th element is initially `mex - ar[i]`.
- `i` is `x - 2`.
- If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.

### Code Execution:
```python
res[i] = mex - ar[i]
```

### Impact Analysis:
- The code updates the `i`th element of the list `res` to be `mex - ar[i]`.
- No other variables are directly modified by this line of code.
- The condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]` does not affect the current line of code directly, but it implies that `mex` might have been updated before this line was executed.

### Output State:
Since only `res[i]` is modified, and no other variables are affected, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`th element is now `mex - ar[i]`, `i` is `x - 2`.**
