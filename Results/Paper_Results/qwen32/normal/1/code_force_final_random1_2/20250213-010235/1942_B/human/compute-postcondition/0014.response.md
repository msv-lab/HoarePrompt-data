The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. The loop iterates over the indices of the list `ar` in reverse order, starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `x - 1`. Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x - 2`.

Here's how we adjust the state:

- `i` was `x - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be `x - 2`.

No other variables in the loop head (`ar`) need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`th element is `mex - ar[i]` instead of `n - ar[i]`, `i` is `x - 2`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.**
