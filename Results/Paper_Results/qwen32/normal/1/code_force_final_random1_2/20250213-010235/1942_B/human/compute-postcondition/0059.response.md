To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This represents the number of test cases.
- `n` is the input integer, representing the number of elements in the list `ar`.
- `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `res` is a list of `n` values where each `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` at the time of computation.
- `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the transformed list `ar` after the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `ar`**: This list contains `n` integers. The specific values are not provided, but they are used to compute the `mex` and subsequently the `res` list.
2. **Variable `mex`**: This is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `ar` after it has been transformed (possibly modified during the loop).
3. **List `res`**: This list is computed such that each element `res[i]` is the difference between `mex` and the corresponding element `ar[i]`.

### Computation:
- For each element in `ar`, the corresponding element in `res` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`.
- After all elements in `ar` have been processed, the `res` list is printed with elements separated by spaces.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be a space-separated string of integers, where each integer is the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `ar` from `mex`.

### Final Output:
Output: **[space-separated values of res where each value is mex - ar[i]] (where mex is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the transformed list ar and ar[i] are the elements of the input list ar)**

This description captures the precise nature of the output based on the given initial state and the computation performed in the code snippet.
