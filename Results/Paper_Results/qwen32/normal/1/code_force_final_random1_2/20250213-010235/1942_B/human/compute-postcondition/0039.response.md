To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the logic involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases.
2. **`n`**: An input integer representing the length of the list `ar`.
3. **`ar`**: A list of integers obtained from the input.
4. **`res`**: A list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` during the corresponding iteration.
5. **`mex`**: The smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the calculations.

### Calculation Process:
For each element in the list `ar`, the value of `mex` is determined, and then `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`.

### Output:
The `print` statement joins all elements of the `res` list into a single string separated by spaces and prints it.

### Detailed Explanation:
- **`mex` Calculation**: `mex` starts at 0 and increments until it finds a value that hasn't been encountered yet in the list `ar` or in the previously computed `res` values.
- **`res[i]` Calculation**: For each element `ar[i]`, `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`. After this calculation, `mex` is updated to the next smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's assume an example to illustrate the process:
- Suppose `ar = [1, 2, 0]` and `n = 3`.
- Initially, `mex = 0`.
- For `ar[0] = 1`:
  - `mex = 0` is already used (since it hasn't been used yet, but we need to find the smallest unused), so `mex = 1`.
  - `res[0] = mex - ar[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`.
  - Now, `mex` needs to be updated to the next smallest unused integer, which is `0` (since `1` is used now).
- For `ar[1] = 2`:
  - `mex = 0` is already used, so `mex = 1` is already used, so `mex = 2`.
  - `res[1] = mex - ar[1] = 2 - 2 = 0`.
  - Now, `mex` needs to be updated to the next smallest unused integer, which is `0` (since `1` and `2` are used now).
- For `ar[2] = 0`:
  - `mex = 0` is already used, so `mex = 1` is already used, so `mex = 2` is already used, so `mex = 3`.
  - `res[2] = mex - ar[2] = 3 - 0 = 3`.
  - Now, `mex` needs to be updated to the next smallest unused integer, which is `0` (since `1`, `2`, and `3` are used now).

Thus, `res = [0, 0, 3]`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the elements of `res` joined by spaces.

Output: **0 0 3 (where res is calculated based on the given conditions and input list ar)**

However, since the exact values of `ar` and `n` are not provided, the most precise description we can give is:

Output: **the elements of `res` list joined by spaces, where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` with `mex` being the smallest non-negative integer not used in previous calculations**.
