### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and its annotations against the problem description to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to construct a permutation \( p \) such that for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program processes each test case by iterating through the array \( a \) in reverse order and constructing the permutation \( p \) using the formula \( \text{res}[i] = \text{mex} - \text{ar}[i] \). The MEX value is updated accordingly.

#### Key Points:
1. **Reverse Iteration**: The program starts from the last element of \( a \) and works backward. This approach ensures that we can determine the MEX value for the entire permutation and then work backward to construct \( p \).
2. **Updating MEX**: The MEX value is initialized to \( n \) (the maximum possible value of MEX for a permutation of size \( n \)). As we construct the permutation from the end, we update MEX to be the smallest unused non-negative integer.
3. **Constructing \( p \)**: For each element in \( a \), the corresponding element in \( p \) is calculated as \( \text{mex} - \text{ar}[i] \).

#### Verification:
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: \( n=5 \), \( a=[1, 1, -2, 1, 2] \)
   - Output: \( p=[0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \)
   - Verification:
     - \( a_5 = \text{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1 \) (but actually \( a_5 = 2 \))
     - \( a_4 = \text{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2]) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1 \)
     - \( a_3 = \text{MEX}([0, 1, 4]) - 4 = 2 - 4 = -2 \)
     - \( a_2 = \text{MEX}([0, 1]) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
     - \( a_1 = \text{MEX}([0]) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1 \)
   - The output does not satisfy the conditions as \( a_5 \) should be 2, but the calculation shows -1.

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: \( n=5 \), \( a=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1] \)
   - Output: \( p=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4] \)
   - Verification:
     - \( a_5 = \text{MEX}([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1 \)
     - \( a_4 = \text{MEX}([0, 1, 2, 3]) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1 \)
     - \( a_3 = \text{MEX}([0, 1, 2]) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1 \)
     - \( a_2 = \text{MEX}([0, 1]) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
     - \( a_1 = \text{MEX}([0]) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1 \)
   - The output satisfies the conditions.

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: \( n=3 \), \( a=[-2, 1, 2] \)
   - Output: \( p=[2, 0, 1] \)
   - Verification:
     - \( a_3 = \text{MEX}([2, 0, 1]) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2 \)
     - \( a_2 = \text{MEX}([2, 0]) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1 \)
     - \( a_1 = \text{MEX}([2]) - 2 = 0 - 2 = -2 \)
   - The output satisfies the conditions.

### Conclusion:
Upon closer inspection, the first example reveals an inconsistency. The program's output for the first example does not match the expected conditions, indicating that the program may not be correctly handling all cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the discrepancy found in the first example, the program is not always producing correct results.

Final: **False**
