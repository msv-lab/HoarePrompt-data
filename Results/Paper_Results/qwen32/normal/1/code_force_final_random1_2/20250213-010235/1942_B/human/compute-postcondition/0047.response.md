Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are `None`, and `mex` is `n`. The current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.**
