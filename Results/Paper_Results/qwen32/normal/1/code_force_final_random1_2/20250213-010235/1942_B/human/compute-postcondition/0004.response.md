The variable `mex` is assigned the value of `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `None`; `mex` is `n`.**
