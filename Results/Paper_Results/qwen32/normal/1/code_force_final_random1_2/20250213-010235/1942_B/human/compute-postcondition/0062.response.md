Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes and prints a list `res` where each element is determined by subtracting the corresponding element in `a` from a decreasing maximum value `mex`, starting from `n`.**
