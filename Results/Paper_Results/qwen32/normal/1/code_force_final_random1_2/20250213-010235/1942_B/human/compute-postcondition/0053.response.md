Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, and if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `res[len(ar) - 2]`. `i` is `len(ar) - 2`.**
