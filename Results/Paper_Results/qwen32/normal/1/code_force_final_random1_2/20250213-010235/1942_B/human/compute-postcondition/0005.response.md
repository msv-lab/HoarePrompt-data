To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
```

The variables in the loop head are:
- `i`: the loop variable
- `len(ar) - 1`: the starting point of the loop (inclusive)
- `-1`: the ending point of the loop (exclusive)
- `-1`: the step value (decrement by 1 each time)

For the loop to execute, the starting point (`len(ar) - 1`) must be greater than or equal to the ending point (`-1`). This means `len(ar)` must be at least 1 for the loop to run.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `res` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `None`
- `mex` is `n`

We need to ensure that `len(ar)` is at least 1. Since `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input, we need to specify that `ar` must have at least one element.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `None`, `mex` is `n`**
