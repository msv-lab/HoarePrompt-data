To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head is defined as:

```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
```

From this, we can identify the following variables that need to be considered:
- `i`: The loop variable.
- `len(ar)`: The length of the list `ar`.

For the loop to execute, `len(ar)` must be at least 1 because the range function `range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1)` will generate indices starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`. If `len(ar)` is 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. **`ar`**: The list `ar` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
2. **`i`**: The initial value of `i` will be `len(ar) - 1`, but we don't need to explicitly set `i` before the loop starts since it is automatically initialized by the `range` function.
3. **`len(ar)`**: This should be at least 1 to ensure the loop runs.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `res`, `mex`) are not directly related to the execution of the loop based on the given loop head.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `ar` has at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` `None` values, and `mex` is `n`.**
