### Reasoning:

The program aims to reconstruct the permutation \( p \) from the array \( a \) using the relationship \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). Here's a step-by-step analysis of the approach taken by the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an empty result list `res` of size \( n \).
   - It also initializes `mex` to \( n \), which is the highest possible value for MEX in the beginning.

2. **Reverse Iteration**:
   - The program iterates through the array `ar` (which represents \( a \)) in reverse order.
   - For each element \( a_i \) in `ar`, it calculates the corresponding element in `res` using the formula \( p_i = \texttt{MEX} - a_i \).

3. **Updating MEX**:
   - After calculating \( p_i \), the program updates `mex` to be the minimum between the current `mex` and \( p_i \). This step ensures that `mex` always holds the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used yet in the permutation `res`.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the reconstructed permutation `res` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Approach:

- **Correctness of Reverse Iteration**: The key insight here is that by iterating in reverse, the program can correctly determine the MEX at each step without needing to know future elements of the permutation. This is because the MEX at position \( i \) only depends on the elements up to position \( i \), and by going backwards, we ensure that all future elements are already considered in the MEX calculation.
  
- **Updating MEX**: By updating `mex` to be the minimum between the current `mex` and \( p_i \), the program ensures that `mex` always points to the smallest unused integer, which is crucial for maintaining the correct MEX value for subsequent calculations.

- **Guaranteed Validity**: The problem guarantees that at least one valid permutation exists for the given input. Therefore, the approach will always find a valid solution.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program correctly reconstructs the permutation \( p \) from the array \( a \) based on the provided relationship. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
