The given code modifies the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `ar` remains a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 1 element.
- `res` remains a list of `n` elements where the `i`th element is `mex - ar[i]` instead of `n - ar[i]`.
- `i` remains `x - 1`.
- `mex` is now `mex - ar[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`th element is `mex - ar[i]` instead of `n - ar[i]`, `i` is `x - 1`, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`.**
