Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the newly input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element, `i` is `i + 1`, and `j` is `j + 1`. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs to `test`.**
