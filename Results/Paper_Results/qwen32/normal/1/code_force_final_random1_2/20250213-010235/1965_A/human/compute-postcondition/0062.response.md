Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `test` is `False`, `j` is incremented by 1 regardless of whether `j % 2 == 1` or not.**

In this output state, the value of `test` has been explicitly set to `False`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
