Postcondition: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements where the first element `t` is 1, followed by a unique set of integers representing the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile without duplicates; `i` is `i + 1`; `A` is False; `not_c` is False if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, otherwise `not_c` remains unchanged; `set_` remains the same.**
