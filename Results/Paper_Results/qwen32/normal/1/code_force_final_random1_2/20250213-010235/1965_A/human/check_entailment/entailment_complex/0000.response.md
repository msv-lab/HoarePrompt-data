### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it against the problem description and the expected behavior.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles (`n`) and the list of stones in each pile (`arr`).
   
2. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules.
   - The initial condition checks if the first element of `arr` is not equal to 1. However, this check seems incorrect because `arr` should contain the number of piles and the stones in each pile, not the number of test cases. This condition should be based on the length of `arr` instead.
   - The function then creates a set from `arr` to get unique stone counts, sorts it, and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is more than 1.
   - If the differences are all 1 or less, it toggles the boolean variable `A` based on the number of unique stone counts.
   - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise 'Bob'.

3. **Issues in the Logic:**
   - The condition `if (arr[0] != 1):` is incorrect. It should be checking the length of `arr` to determine the number of piles.
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the differences between unique stone counts does not align with the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) strategy used in combinatorial game theory for determining the winner in such games.
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly determine the winner, we need to use the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the number of stones in each pile. If the Nim-sum is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    nim_sum = 0
    for stones in arr:
        nim_sum ^= stones
    return 'Alice' if nim_sum != 0 else 'Bob'
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly determine the winner based on the rules of the game. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
