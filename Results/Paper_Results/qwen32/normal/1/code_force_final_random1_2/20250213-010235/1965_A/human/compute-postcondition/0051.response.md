Given the initial state, let's analyze the context and the print statement:

- `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is another integer input.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with more than one element.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `test` is set to `True`.
- `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1` indicates that there is a gap greater than 1 between the j-th and (j-1)-th elements in `lis`.
- `j` is an odd number.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Bob')
```

This print statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It directly prints the string `'Bob'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Bob**
