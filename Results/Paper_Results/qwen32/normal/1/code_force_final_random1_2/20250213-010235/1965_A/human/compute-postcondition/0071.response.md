Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `j` is `j + 1`. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.**
