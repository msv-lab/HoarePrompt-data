Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers structured as described. It processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of the number of piles and the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, the function determines the winner of a game and returns 'Alice' under certain conditions specified in Case_1 and Case_2. Specifically, it returns 'Alice' if either the condition in Case_1 is met or if `not_c` is True in Case_2; otherwise, it returns 'Bob'.**
