To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `j`.

Given:
- The loop is defined as `for j in range(1, len(lis)):`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the newly input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new split input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- The variable `j` has just completed its current iteration.
- If the difference between the `j`-th element and the `(j-1)`-th element in `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is `False` and we break out of the loop; otherwise, `test` remains `True`.

Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's assume `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the newly input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`**.

Note: We do not need to adjust `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, or `i` because they are not part of the loop head. The variable `test` is also not part of the loop head and its state is determined within the loop body, so it does not need to be adjusted here.
