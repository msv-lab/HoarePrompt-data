Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the newly input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new split input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `i` is `i + 1`. If 1 is not in `lis` or `lis` has only one element, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, `test` is `True` and the length of `lis` is either odd or even.**
