Given the initial state described, let's analyze the variables and the print statement:

- `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is another integer input.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from a new split input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` with more than one element, and its length is even.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).
- `test` is set to `True`.

The print statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('Bob')
```

This print statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned above (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, `test`). It simply prints the string `'Bob'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not require any computation or consideration of the other variables.

Output: **Bob**
