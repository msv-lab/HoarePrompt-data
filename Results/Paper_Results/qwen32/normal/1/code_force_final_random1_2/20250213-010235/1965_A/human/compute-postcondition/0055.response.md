Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a map object containing integers from the split input; `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `test` is `False`; `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`; `j` is either an odd number or an even number.**

Natural Language: The variable `test` has been set to `False`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
