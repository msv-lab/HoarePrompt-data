To determine what will be printed when the `print('Alice')` statement is executed, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is a newly input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from a new split input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have more than one element.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `j` is `j + 1`.
- If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs to `test`.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, `i`, `j`, `test`) are used in the `print('Alice')` statement. The `print('Alice')` statement is independent of these variables and simply outputs the string `'Alice'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print('Alice')` statement is:

Output: **Alice**
