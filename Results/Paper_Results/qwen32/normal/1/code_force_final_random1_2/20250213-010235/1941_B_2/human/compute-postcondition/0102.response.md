Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `numTest` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i+1]` now equal to 0, `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `stop` is True if `a[i]` is less than 0, otherwise `stop` remains False, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `opNum` is updated to `a[i]`. All other variables retain their previous states.
