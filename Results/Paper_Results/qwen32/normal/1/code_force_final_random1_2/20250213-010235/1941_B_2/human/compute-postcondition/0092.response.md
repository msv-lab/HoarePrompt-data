Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `numTest` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input. If the current element `a[i]` is less than 0, `stop` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains False.**
