The function `func_2` takes a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` (where 3 <= n <= length of the list). It modifies the list by potentially setting some elements to zero and adjusting others based on specific conditions. After modifying the list, it checks a condition using another function `func_1`. Depending on the result of this check, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'. The final state of the program includes the modified list and a printed message indicating whether the condition was met.
