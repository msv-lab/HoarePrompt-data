### Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. The program only checks the parity and specific consecutive differences of the first and last elements of the array, which is insufficient to solve the problem.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that the entire array can be reduced to zeros through the allowed operations. The key insight is that the operations affect three consecutive elements at a time, and the parity (odd/even nature) of the elements plays a crucial role. Specifically, the sum of all elements in the array must be even because each operation reduces the total sum by 4 (which is even).

However, the provided code does not check the total sum of the array or any other necessary conditions beyond the parity and consecutive differences of the first and last elements. This makes the solution incomplete and potentially incorrect for many cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
