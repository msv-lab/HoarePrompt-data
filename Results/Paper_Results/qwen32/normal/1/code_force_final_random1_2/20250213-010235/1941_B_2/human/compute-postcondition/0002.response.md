The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `b`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `a` retains its initial value.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and `a` is an input integer, the only change is the creation of the list `b` from the new input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an input integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
