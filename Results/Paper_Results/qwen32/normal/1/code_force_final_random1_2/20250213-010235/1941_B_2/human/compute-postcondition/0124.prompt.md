Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(0, numTest):
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    stop = False
    for i in range(0, n - 2):
        if a[i] < 0:
            print('NO')
            stop = True
            break
        opNum = a[i]
        a[i] -= opNum
        a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
        a[i + 2] -= opNum
    if stop == True:
        continue
    if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` remains greater than 0, `n` remains unchanged, and `stop` is a boolean indicating whether the loop terminated early or completed all iterations. If `stop` is True, `a` reflects the reductions made up to the point of termination. If `stop` is False, `a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n - 3` becomes 0, and `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` are reduced by `2 * a[i]` and `a[i]` respectively. Additionally, either the last two elements of `a` are both 0 (`a[len(a) - 1] == 0` and `a[len(a) - 2] == 0`), or at least one of them is not 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is decreased by 1, `n` remains the same, `a[i]` is 0 for all i from 0 to n - 3, `a[n - 2]` and `a[n - 1]` remain unchanged. If either `a[n - 1]` or `a[n - 2]` is not 0, then the condition `a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0` holds true. If both `a[n - 2]` and `a[n - 1]` are 0, then the condition `a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0` does not hold true. If `stop` is True, `stop` remains True. If `stop` is False, `stop` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `numTest` is at least 1; `n` is greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is 0 for `i` from 0 to `n - 3`. If either `a[n - 2]` or `a[n - 1]` is not 0, then `a[n - 2]` or `a[n - 1]` remains unchanged. If both `a[n - 2]` and `a[n - 1]` are 0, then they remain 0. `stop` is True if at least one `a[i]` was negative, otherwise `stop` remains False; `i` is `n - 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
