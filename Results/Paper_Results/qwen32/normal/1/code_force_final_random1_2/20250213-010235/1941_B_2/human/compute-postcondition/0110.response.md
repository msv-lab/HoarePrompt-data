Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `numTest` is at least 1; `n` is greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is 0, `a[i+1]` is 0, and `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged; `opNum` is 0; `stop` is True if `a[i]` is less than 0, otherwise `stop` remains False; `i` is 4.**
