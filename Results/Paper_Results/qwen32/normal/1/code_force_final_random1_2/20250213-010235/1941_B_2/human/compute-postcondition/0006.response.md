Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- Conditions on `b`:
  - Either `b[0]` is even, or `b[0]` is odd and `b[1]` is equal to `b[0] + 2`.
  - Either `b[-1]` is even, or `b[-1]` is odd and `b[-2]` is equal to `b[-1] + 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. This statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`. It simply prints the string `'YES'` regardless of the input conditions provided.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
