Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `numTest` is at least 1
- `n` is greater than 2
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` now equal to 0
- `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged
- `opNum` is `a[i]` (which is 0)
- `stop` remains False unless `a[i]` is less than 0
- `i` remains unchanged

Code Snippet:
```python
a[i + 2] -= opNum
```

Since `opNum` is `a[i]` and `a[i]` is 0, the operation `a[i + 2] -= opNum` translates to `a[i + 2] -= 0`. This means that the value of `a[i + 2]` does not change.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `numTest` is at least 1; `n` is greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` now equal to 0; `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged; `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged; `opNum` is `a[i]` (which is 0); `stop` remains False unless `a[i]` is less than 0; `i` remains unchanged.**
