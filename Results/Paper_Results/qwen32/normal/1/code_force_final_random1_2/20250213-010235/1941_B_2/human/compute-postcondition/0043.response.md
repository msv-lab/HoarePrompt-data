The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` based on the user's input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `stop` is a boolean indicating whether the loop terminated early or completed all iterations. If `stop` is True, `a` reflects the reductions made up to the point of termination. If `stop` is False, `a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n - 3` becomes 0, and `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` are reduced by `2 * a[i]` and `a[i]` respectively. Additionally, either the last two elements of `a` are both 0 (`a[len(a) - 1] == 0` and `a[len(a) - 2] == 0`), or at least one of them is not 0.**
