You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    7
    
    5
    
    1 3 5 5 2
    
    5
    
    2 4 4 5 1
    
    5
    
    0 1 3 3 1
    
    6
    
    5 6 0 2 3 0
    
    4
    
    1 2 7 2
    
    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks specific conditions related to the parity and consecutive differences of the first and last elements of the list `a`. It prints "YES" if the conditions are met, otherwise it prints "NO".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to reduce all elements of the array to zero using the specified operation. The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq n-1 \)) and modifying the elements at positions \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) as follows:
- \( a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1 \)
- \( a_i = a_i - 2 \)
- \( a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1 \)

The key observation here is that the operation always decreases the total sum of the array by 4. Therefore, if the total sum of the array is not divisible by 4, it is impossible to make all elements zero.

However, the problem also imposes additional constraints based on the parity (odd/even nature) of the first and last elements of the array. Specifically:
- If the first element \( a_1 \) is odd, then the second element \( a_2 \) must be exactly \( a_1 + 2 \).
- If the last element \( a_n \) is odd, then the second-to-last element \( a_{n-1} \) must be exactly \( a_n + 2 \).

These constraints ensure that the operation can propagate correctly from the ends of the array towards the center.

### Program Analysis

The provided program checks these constraints for the first and last elements of the array. However, it does not check if the total sum of the array is divisible by 4, which is another crucial condition for the possibility of reducing the array to zeros.

Here is the logic in the provided program:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
- It then checks two conditions:
  - If the first element is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, it prints "NO".
  - If the last element is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2, it prints "NO".
  - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Conclusion

While the program correctly checks the parity-based constraints, it fails to consider the divisibility by 4 constraint. Therefore, the program may incorrectly report "YES" for arrays whose total sum is not divisible by 4.

### Example Counter-Case

Consider the following array:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The total sum is 15, which is not divisible by 4. According to the problem statement, it should be impossible to reduce this array to zeros. However, the provided program would print "YES" because it only checks the parity constraints and does not check the divisibility by 4.
