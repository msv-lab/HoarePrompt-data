Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `numTest` is at least 1; `n` is greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is 0 for `i` from 0 to `n - 3`, and `a[n - 2]` and `a[n - 1]` remain unchanged; `stop` is True if at least one `a[i]` was negative, otherwise `stop` remains False; `i` is `n - 2`; `a[n - 1]` is 0 and `a[n - 2]` is 0**
