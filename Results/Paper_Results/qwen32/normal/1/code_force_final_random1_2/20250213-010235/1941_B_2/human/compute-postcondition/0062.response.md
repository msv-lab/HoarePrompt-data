The code snippet `a[i] -= opNum` modifies the value of `a[i]` by subtracting `opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is equal to `a[i]`, this operation effectively sets `a[i]` to 0.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `numTest` is decreased by 1.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is now 0 (since `a[i] -= opNum` and `opNum` is equal to `a[i]`).
- `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged.
- `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged.
- `opNum` is equal to the original value of `a[i]` before the subtraction.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- If `a[i]` was less than 0 before the operation, `stop` would be True and we would break out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, since `a[i]` is set to 0, `stop` remains False.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is decreased by 1; `n` is greater than 2; `a[i]` is 0; `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged; `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged; `opNum` is the original value of `a[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `stop` remains False.**
