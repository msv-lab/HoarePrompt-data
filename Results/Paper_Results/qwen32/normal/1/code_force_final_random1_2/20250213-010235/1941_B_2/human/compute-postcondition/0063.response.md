The code snippet `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` modifies the value of `a[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is the original value of `a[i]` and `a[i]` is 0, `opNum` is also 0. Therefore, `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged because `2 * opNum` equals 0.

The other variables (`t`, `numTest`, `n`, `a[i + 2]`, `stop`) remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is decreased by 1; `n` is greater than 2; `a[i]` is 0; `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged; `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged; `opNum` is the original value of `a[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `stop` remains False.**
