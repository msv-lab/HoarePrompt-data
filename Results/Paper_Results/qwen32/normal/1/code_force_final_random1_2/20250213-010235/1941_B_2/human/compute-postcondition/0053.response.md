The code snippet `a[i] -= opNum` modifies the element at index `i` in the list `a` by subtracting the value of `opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is equal to `a[i]`, the operation effectively sets `a[i]` to `a[i] - a[i]`, which results in `a[i]` being 0.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` now equal to 0, `stop` remains False, `opNum` is equal to the original value of `a[i]`.**
