The code assigns the value of the count of the substring 'pie' in the string `s` to the variable `y`. The values of `t`, `a`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the integer value read from the user input, `s` is the string value read from the user input, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.**
