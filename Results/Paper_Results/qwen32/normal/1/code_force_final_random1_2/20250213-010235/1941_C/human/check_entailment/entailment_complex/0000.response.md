### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in each test case's string `s`. It then outputs the sum of these counts as the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

However, this approach is flawed. The problem requires finding the minimum number of deletions to remove all occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie," which means overlapping occurrences and optimal deletion strategies need to be considered. Simply counting the occurrences does not guarantee the minimal deletions because deleting characters in one occurrence might affect another.

For example, consider the string "mappie". Counting occurrences would give us 1 for "map" and 1 for "pie", totaling 2 deletions. However, deleting the characters at indices 2 and 3 ("pp") would suffice to remove both substrings, requiring only 2 deletions but in a more strategic manner than just counting non-overlapping occurrences.

The current implementation does not account for such overlaps and optimal deletions, leading to incorrect results in many cases.
