Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string and prints their sum. However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful. 

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the minimum number of deletions required to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring in the resulting string. This involves more complex logic than just counting occurrences, as the removal of one character might affect multiple occurrences of the substrings.

For example, in the first test case with the string "mmapnapie", the program would output 3 (1 for "map" and 2 for "pie"), but the correct answer is 2, as removing the 4th and 9th characters ("mmapnapie" -> "mmanpie" -> "mannpie") makes the string beautiful with only 2 deletions.
