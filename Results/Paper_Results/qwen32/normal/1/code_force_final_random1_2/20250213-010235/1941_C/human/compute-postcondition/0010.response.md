The code updates the value of `y` to be the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`. The values of `t`, `a`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `a` is the new integer value read from the user input, `s` is the new string value read from the user input, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**
