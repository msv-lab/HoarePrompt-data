To determine what will be printed by the `print(x + y)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. However, `t` does not directly affect the `print` statement in this context.
- `a` is an integer value read from user input. This value is not used in the `print` statement.
- `s` is a string value read from user input. This string is used to count occurrences of specific substrings.
- `x` is the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`.
- `y` is the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`.

The `print` statement calculates the sum of `x` and `y`, which represents the total number of times the substrings 'map' and 'pie' appear in the string `s`.

Given that the exact content of the string `s` is not specified, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `x` and `y`. However, we can describe the output precisely in terms of these variables.

Output: **x + y (where x is the number of times 'map' appears in the string s, and y is the number of times 'pie' appears in the string s)**
