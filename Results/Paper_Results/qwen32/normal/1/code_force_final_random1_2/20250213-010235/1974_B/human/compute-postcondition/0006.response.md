Postcondition: **`s` is a list of strings where each string `b` consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string `b` is between 1 and 2 · 10^5. The length of the list `s` (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `s`. `i` is 0, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`. `s` must have at least one string. Additionally, `char` is not in `unique_chars`.**
