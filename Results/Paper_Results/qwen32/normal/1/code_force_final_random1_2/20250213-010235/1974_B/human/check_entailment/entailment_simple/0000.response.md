### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Construct the auxiliary string `r`:**
   - `r` should consist of all distinct letters of the string `b` (which is the encoded string), written in alphabetical order.
   
2. **Decoding process:**
   - Each character in the string `b` should be replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r`.
   - The first character of `b` is replaced by the last character of `r`, the second character of `b` is replaced by the second-to-last character of `r`, and so on.

#### Given Program Analysis:
- The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the encoded string `b` and then reads the string `b` itself.
- It calls the function `func_1(b)` to decode the string `b`.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- **Step 1:** It creates a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them to form `unique_chars`.
- **Step 2:** It initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`. `i` starts at 0 and `j` starts at the last index of `unique_chars`.
- **Step 3:** It iterates through each character in `b`. If the character is in `unique_chars`, it replaces all occurrences of that character in `b` with the character at index `j` in `unique_chars` and decrements `j`. If the character is not in `unique_chars`, it inserts the character at index `i` in `unique_chars` and increments both `i` and `j`. However, this part of the logic seems incorrect because the problem guarantees that all characters in `b` are in `unique_chars` (since `b` is formed by replacing characters from `s` with their symmetric counterparts in `r`).

- **Step 4:** After processing all characters, it returns the joined `unique_chars`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The main issue is the incorrect handling of the replacement process. The program attempts to replace characters in `b` directly within the loop, which is not the intended approach. Instead, it should map each character in `b` to its corresponding character in `r` and construct the decoded string accordingly.
- The final return statement `return ''.join(unique_chars)` does not produce the decoded string but instead returns the sorted unique characters of `b`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
