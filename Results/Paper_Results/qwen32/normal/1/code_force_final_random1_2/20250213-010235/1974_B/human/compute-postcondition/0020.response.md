The code snippet `j -= 1` decrements the value of `j` by 1. The other variables (`s`, `unique_chars`, and `char`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of strings where each string `b` has all occurrences of `char` replaced with `unique_chars[j]`; `unique_chars` is a list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `s`; `char` is the next element in the list `s`; `j` is decreased by 1.**
