Postcondition: **`s` is a list of strings where each string `b` consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string `b` is between 1 and 2 · 10^5. The length of the list `s` (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `unique_chars` is a list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `s`. If `char` was in `unique_chars`, each occurrence of `char` in `s` has been replaced with `unique_chars[j]`, `i` is 0, and `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2`. If `char` was not in `unique_chars`, `char` is now the first element of `unique_chars`, making it potentially unsorted, `i` is 1, and `j` is `len(unique_chars)`. Additionally, `char` is in `unique_chars`.**
