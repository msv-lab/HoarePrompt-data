The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `s`. If there are more elements in `s`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `char` was the last processed element from the list `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `s` to be processed. Therefore, `char` should be the next element in the list `s`.

Given that `i` and `j` are not part of the loop head, they remain unchanged. The state of `s` and `unique_chars` might change based on the operations inside the loop, but for determining the state at the start of the next iteration, we only focus on `char`.

Since `char` is the loop variable, at the start of the next iteration, `char` will be the next element in the list `s`.

State: **`s` is a list of strings where each string `b` consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string `b` is between 1 and 2 · 10^5. The length of the list `s` (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `unique_chars` is a list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `s`. `char` is the next element in the list `s`.**
