To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and how they contribute to the final output:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `time`: This variable is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is used in the print statement. We need to assume that `time` holds some integer value representing the current time or turn number.
   - `player`: This variable is determined based on the conditions provided:
     - If `obj` is a player (which is not explicitly defined in the initial state but can be inferred as an identifier starting with 'P'), then `player` is set to `obj`.
     - Otherwise, `player` is set to the element at the position `nxt` in the `grid`.

2. **Position Calculations:**
   - `pos`: This is the position of `obj` as retrieved from the `elements` dictionary.
   - `nxt`: This is calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, where `mov` is presumably a dictionary mapping commands to movement vectors (e.g., {'UP': (-1, 0), 'DOWN': (1, 0), 'LEFT': (0, -1), 'RIGHT': (0, 1)}).

3. **Determination of `player`:**
   - If `obj` is a player identifier (e.g., 'P1', 'P2'), then `player` will be `obj`.
   - If `obj` is not a player identifier, `player` will be the element at the `nxt` position in the `grid`.

Given these points, let's construct the output:

- `time`: This is an integer representing the current time or turn number.
- `player`: This will either be the player identifier (`obj`) if `obj` is a player, or the element at the `nxt` position in the `grid` if `obj` is not a player.

Since the exact values of `time` and `player` depend on the specific runtime values of `obj`, `pos`, `mov`, and `com`, we cannot provide a concrete numerical value for `player` without additional information. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **[time] [player] ELIMINATED (where [time] is the current time or turn number and [player] is either the player identifier obj if obj is a player, or the element at the nxt position in the grid if obj is not a player)**
