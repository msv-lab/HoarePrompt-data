Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False`, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals, and `points` is `[0, 0]`; `t` is an integer read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False` except `allPlayers[obj]` which is `True` if `el` is '.Q' when `len(command) == 3`. Otherwise, `allPlayers` remains unchanged. `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals. `points` is `[10, 0]` if `team` is 1 (i.e., `obj[0]` is 'B') and `el` is not '.Q', otherwise `points` is `[0, 10]` if `team` is not 1 and `el` is not '.Q'. If `el` is '.Q', `points` remains `[0, 0]` when `len(command) == 3`. If `len(command) != 3`, `points` is `[0, 0]` unless `goalIn(pos)` does not return `-1`, in which case `points[team]` is incremented by 1. `t` must be greater than 0. `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input. `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command` when `len(command) == 3`. When `len(command) != 3`, `pos` is the position of `obj` as retrieved from `elements`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is `.B` and the element at `nxt` in `grid` is a player, then `player` is assigned the value of the element at `nxt` in `grid` and `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `obj` is not `.B`, no changes are made to `elements` or `player`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False` except `allPlayers[obj]` which is `True` if `el` is '.Q' when `len(command) == 3`. Otherwise, `allPlayers` remains unchanged. `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals. If `len(command) == 3`, `points` is updated based on the value of `el`: if `el` is '.Q', `points` remains `[0, 0]`; if `el` is '.S', `points` is incremented by 10 for the respective team; otherwise, `points` is incremented by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` does not return `-1`. If `len(command) != 3`, `points` is `[0, 0]` unless `goalIn(pos)` does not return `-1`, in which case `points[team]` is incremented by 1. `t` must be greater than 0. `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input. `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command` when `len(command) == 3`. When `len(command) != 3`, `pos` is the position of `obj` as retrieved from `elements`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is `.B` and the element at `nxt` in `grid` is a player, then `player` is assigned the value of the element at `nxt` in `grid` and `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `obj` is not `.B` and `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`. If `obj` is not `.B` and `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. `player` is assigned the value of `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is `True`, otherwise `player` is assigned the value of `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. `time` is `current_time + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False` except `allPlayers[obj]` which is `True` if `el` is '.Q' when `len(command) == 3`. Otherwise, `allPlayers` remains unchanged, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals. `points` is `[0, 0]` unless `el` is '.S', in which case `points` is `[0, 10]` if `team` is 1 (i.e., the first character of `obj` is 'B'), otherwise `points` is `[10, 0]`. `t` must be greater than 0. `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command` when `len(command) == 3`. `time` is `current_time + 1`. If `len(command) == 3`, `pos` is `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, and if `obj` is '.B', `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
