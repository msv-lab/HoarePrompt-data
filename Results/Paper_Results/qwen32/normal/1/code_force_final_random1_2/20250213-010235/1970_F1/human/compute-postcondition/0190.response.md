Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False` except `allPlayers[obj]` which is `True` if `el` is '.Q' when `len(command) == 3`. Otherwise, `allPlayers` remains unchanged. `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals. `points` is `[0, 0]` unless specified otherwise. `t` must be greater than 0. `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input. `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command` when `len(command) == 3`. `time` is `current_time + 1`. `pos` is `elements[obj]`. `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is true, or if `isPlayer(obj)` is true and `elements['.B']` equals `nxt`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, if `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`. If `isPlayer(obj)` is true and `com` is not 'T', `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `isPlayer(obj)` is false and `com` is not 'T', none of these variables are updated.**
