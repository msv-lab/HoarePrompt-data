Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the grid (N lines and M columns); `grid` is an empty list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, now `elements` is `{'.B': (-1, -1)}`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping player identifiers to a boolean indicating whether they are carrying the Quaffle, now `allPlayers` is `{}`; `goal` is a list of lists, where `goal[0]` contains tuples representing the positions of blue goals and `goal[1]` contains tuples representing the positions of red goals, now `goal` is `[[], []]`; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams, respectively, now `points` is `[0, 0]`.**

In natural language: The dimensions of the grid (`n` and `m`) remain unchanged. The `grid` is still an empty list. The `elements` dictionary remains unchanged with `'.B'` mapped to `(-1, -1)`. The `allPlayers` dictionary remains unchanged as an empty dictionary. The `goal` list of lists remains unchanged with both sublists being empty. The `points` list is updated to `[0, 0]`, setting the scores of both the blue and red teams to zero.
