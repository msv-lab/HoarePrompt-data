To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the provided initial state and the print statement itself.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `points`, and `t` are mentioned as variables/objects.
- Among these, `points` is specifically relevant to the print statement.
- `points` is described as reflecting accumulated points, but no explicit values are given for `points[0]` and `points[1]`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
```
This statement formats a string with two placeholders (`%d`) that will be replaced by the values of `points[0]` and `points[1]`.

### Determining the Values:
- Since the exact values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot give specific numerical values.
- However, we know that `points` is a list that holds accumulated points for players, and `points[0]` and `points[1]` represent the points for the first and second player respectively.

### Final Output Description:
Given the above analysis, the print statement will output the final scores of the first and second players in the format "FINAL SCORE: [points of player 1] [points of player 2]".

Output: **FINAL SCORE: points[0] points[1] (where points[0] is the accumulated points for the first player and points[1] is the accumulated points for the second player)**
