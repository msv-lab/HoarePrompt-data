The code snippet appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given the initial state, `tmp` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is 2. Therefore, `goal[tmp]` will have the new element `(2, ind)` added to it.

Here's the updated state:

- `n` must be greater than 2 (unchanged).
- `m` is an integer (unchanged).
- `grid` is a list containing three elements, all of which are `line` (unchanged).
- `elements` contains all non-'..' elements from `line` with their positions including `line[ind]` mapped to `(2, ind)` (unchanged).
- `allPlayers` contains all players from `line` with values `False` (unchanged).
- `points` is `[0, 0]` (unchanged).
- `i` is 2 (unchanged).
- `line` is a list of strings read from standard input that must have at least one element (unchanged).
- `line[ind]` is not equal to '..' and `line[ind]` is not a player (unchanged).
- `line[ind][1]` is 'G' (unchanged).
- `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1 (unchanged).
- `goal[tmp]` now includes the additional element `(2, ind)`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing three elements, all of which are `line`, `elements` contains all non-'..' elements from `line` with their positions including `line[ind]` mapped to `(2, ind)`, `allPlayers` contains all players from `line` with values `False`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings read from standard input that must have at least one element, `line[ind]` is not equal to '..' and `line[ind]` is not a player, `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, `goal[tmp]` includes the additional element `(2, ind)`**.
