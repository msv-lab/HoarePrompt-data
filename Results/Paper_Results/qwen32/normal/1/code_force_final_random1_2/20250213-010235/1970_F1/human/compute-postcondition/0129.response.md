To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and how they contribute to the output:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `time`: This variable is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is used in the `print` statement. We need to assume it has been defined somewhere in the code before this point.
   - `GoalName`: This is a dictionary that maps team identifiers to their respective goal names. The exact contents of this dictionary are not provided, but it is assumed to exist.
   - `team`: This variable is the result of the function call `goalIn(pos)`. The function `goalIn` presumably returns a team identifier based on the position `pos`.

2. **Position (`pos`) and Next Position (`nxt`):**
   - `pos` is the position of `obj` as retrieved from the `elements` dictionary.
   - `nxt` is calculated based on the current position `pos` and the movement direction specified by `com` ('T' in this case).

3. **Command and Object:**
   - `command` is a list of two strings, where `obj` is the first element and `com` is the second element ('T').
   - `obj` is the identifier of the object being moved.
   - `com` is the command indicating the direction of movement ('T' typically stands for "top" or moving up in a grid).

4. **Conditions:**
   - Either `obj` is not '.B' (which presumably represents a blue ball), or the next position `nxt` is not occupied by a player.
   - If `obj` is a player, then the position of '.B' (the blue ball) is not the same as `nxt`.

5. **Team Identification:**
   - `team` is determined by the function `goalIn(pos)`, which checks the position `pos` to see which team's goal it is associated with.

Given these points, the `print` statement will output the following:

- `%d %s GOAL` where:
  - `%d` is replaced by the value of `time`.
  - `%s` is replaced by the value of `GoalName[team]`, which is the name of the goal associated with the team identified by `team`.

Since the exact values of `time` and `GoalName[team]` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **time GoalName[team] GOAL (where time is the value of the time variable and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal associated with the team identified by the position pos)**
