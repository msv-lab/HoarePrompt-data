Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False`, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals, `points` is `[10, 0]` if `team` is 1 (i.e., `obj[0]` is 'B'), otherwise `points` is `[0, 10]`. `t` must be greater than 0. `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input and the length of `command` is 3. `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is equal to '.S', `points` is updated accordingly based on the team. Otherwise, `points` remains `[0, 0]`.**
