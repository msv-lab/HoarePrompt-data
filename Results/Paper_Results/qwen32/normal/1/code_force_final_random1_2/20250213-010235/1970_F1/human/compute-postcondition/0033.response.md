The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given that `tmp` is either 0 or 1, this means the tuple will be added to either `goal[0]` or `goal[1]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing one element which is a non-empty list `line`, `elements[line[ind]]` is `(i, ind)`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is `'B'` else 1, `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(i, ind)`.** 

This means that the list `goal[tmp]` has been updated to include the new tuple `(i, ind)`, while all other variables retain their original properties and constraints.
