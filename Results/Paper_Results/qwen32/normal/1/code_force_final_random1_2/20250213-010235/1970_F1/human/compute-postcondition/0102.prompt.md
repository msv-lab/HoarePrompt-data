Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the grid (N lines and M columns); `grid` is an empty list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, now `elements` is `{'.B': (-1, -1)}`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping player identifiers to a boolean indicating whether they are carrying the Quaffle, now `allPlayers` is `{}`; `goal` is a list of lists, where `goal[0]` contains tuples representing the positions of blue goals and `goal[1]` contains tuples representing the positions of red goals, now `goal` is `[[], []]`; `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams, respectively, now `points` is `[0, 0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    grid.append(line)
    for ind in range(len(line)):
        if line[ind] != '..':
            elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
            if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
            elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing one element which is `line`, `elements` contains all non-'..' elements from `line` with their positions, `allPlayers` contains all players from `line` with values `False`, `goal` contains positions of 'G' elements categorized by prefix ('B' or not), `points` is `[0, 0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `line`, `elements` contains all non-'..' elements from `line` with their positions, `allPlayers` contains all players from `line` with values `False`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 1, and `line` is a list of strings read from standard input. The `goal` dictionary contains positions of 'G' elements categorized by prefix ('B' or not).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing three elements, all of which are `line`, `elements` contains all non-'..' elements from `line` with their positions, `allPlayers` contains all players from `line` with values `False`, `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 2, and `line` is a list of strings read from standard input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
