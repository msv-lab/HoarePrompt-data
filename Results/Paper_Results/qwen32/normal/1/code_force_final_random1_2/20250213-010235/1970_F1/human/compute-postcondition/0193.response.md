Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False` except `allPlayers[obj]` which is `True` if `el` is '.Q' when `len(command) == 3`. Otherwise, `allPlayers` remains unchanged, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals. `points` is `[0, 0]` unless `el` is '.S', in which case `points` is `[0, 10]` if `team` is 1 (i.e., the first character of `obj` is 'B'), otherwise `points` is `[10, 0]`. `t` must be greater than 0. `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command` when `len(command) == 3`. `time` is `current_time + 1`. If `len(command) == 3`, `pos` is `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, and if `obj` is '.B', `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
