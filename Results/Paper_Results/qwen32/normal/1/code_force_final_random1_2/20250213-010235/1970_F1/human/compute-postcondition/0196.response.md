Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of the grid, `grid` which is a 2D list of strings representing the field, `elements` which is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, `allPlayers` which is a dictionary mapping player identifiers to a boolean indicating whether they are carrying the Quaffle, `goal` which is a list of lists containing the positions of blue and red goals, and `points` which is a list of two integers representing the scores of the blue and red teams, respectively. The function does not explicitly return any value, but it likely modifies the game state based on the provided parameters.**
