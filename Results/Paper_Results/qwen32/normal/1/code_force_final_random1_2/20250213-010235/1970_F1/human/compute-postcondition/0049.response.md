The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given that `tmp` is 1, this means the tuple `(i, ind)` is added to the list `goal[1]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `line`, `elements` contains all non-'..' elements from `line` with their positions including `line[ind]` mapped to `(1, ind)`, `allPlayers` contains all players from `line` with values `False`, `goal` contains positions of 'G' elements categorized by prefix ('B' or not) with `goal[1]` now including `(i, ind)`, `line[ind]` is equal to 'G', `points` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings read from standard input that must have at least one element, and `line[ind]` is not a player, `tmp` is 1.**
