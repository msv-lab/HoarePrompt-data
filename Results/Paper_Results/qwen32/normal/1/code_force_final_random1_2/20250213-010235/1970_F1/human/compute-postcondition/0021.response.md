The only variable in the loop head is `ind`. Therefore, we need to adjust only this variable for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` is an integer
- `grid` is a list containing one element which is a non-empty list `line`
- If `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, then `elements` is updated to include `line[ind]: (i, ind)`
- If `line[ind]` is a player, `allPlayers` is `{line[ind]: False}`; otherwise, `allPlayers` remains `{}`
- If `line[ind]` is not a player and `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`, then `(i, ind)` is appended to `goal[0]` if `tmp` is `0` (when `line[ind][0]` is `'B'`), or to `goal[1]` if `tmp` is `1` (when `line[ind][0]` is not `'B'`)
- `points` remains `[0, 0]`

At the end of the last iteration, `ind` was used to iterate over `line`. For the loop to execute again, `ind` must be incremented by 1, provided that it is still within the bounds of `line`.

Since `line` is a non-empty list, `len(line)` is at least 1. If `ind` was the last index of `line` in the previous iteration, the loop would terminate. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ind` must be less than `len(line) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's assume `ind` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, where `k < len(line) - 1`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `ind` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing one element which is a non-empty list `line`, `ind` is `ind + 1`**
