To determine the output state, we need to focus on the given code snippet and how it modifies the existing variables. Here is the code snippet again for reference:

```python
nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
```

This line calculates a new position `nxt` based on the current position `pos` and the movement vector defined by `mov[com]`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `pos` is the current position of the object `obj` in the grid, which is `elements[obj]`.
- `mov` is a dictionary that maps commands (like 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right') to their respective movement vectors (like (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)).
- `com` is the command string from the `command` list.

The new position `nxt` is calculated by adding the movement vector `mov[com]` to the current position `pos`.

Thus, the output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False` except `allPlayers[obj]` which is `True` if `el` is '.Q' when `len(command) == 3`. Otherwise, `allPlayers` remains unchanged. `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals. `points` is `[0, 0]` unless specified otherwise. `t` must be greater than 0. `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input. `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command` when `len(command) == 3`. `time` is `current_time + 1`. `pos` is `elements[obj]`. `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.**

In natural language, the output state means that all the variables remain the same except for the introduction of a new variable `nxt`, which holds the new position calculated by adding the movement vector corresponding to the command `com` to the current position `pos`.
