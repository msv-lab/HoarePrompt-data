Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of lines in the grid, `m` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `grid` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a list of strings representing the grid's rows, `elements` is a dictionary mapping each non-'..' element to its position, `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping each player identifier to `False`, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list contains positions of blue goals and the second list contains positions of red goals, and `points` is `[0, 0]`. `t` must be greater than 0. `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input with a length of 2. `obj` is the first element of `command`. `com` is the second element of `command`. `pos` is the position of `obj` as retrieved from `elements`. `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. `player` is assigned the value of `obj` if `obj` is a player, otherwise `player` is assigned the value of the element at `nxt` in `grid`.**

In simple terms, the output state remains the same except that the variable `player` is now assigned a value based on whether `obj` is a player or not. If `obj` is a player, `player` is set to `obj`. If `obj` is not a player, `player` is set to the element at the position `nxt` in the `grid`.
