### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Initial Charge:** The phone starts with `f` units of charge.
2. **Charge Consumption:** The phone consumes `a` units of charge per unit of time while being on.
3. **Turn On/Off Cost:** Turning the phone off and then on again costs `b` units of charge.
4. **Messages:** Stepan needs to send `n` messages at specific moments `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`.
5. **Objective:** Determine if Stepan can send all messages without the phone's charge dropping to zero or below at any point.

#### Program Logic:
1. **Input Parsing:** The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the list of message times `arr`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes an empty list `array2`.
   - For each pair of consecutive message times `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]`, if the time difference `arr[i] - arr[i-1]` is less than `b/a`, it appends the product `(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a` to `array2`.
   - It then calculates the total cost as the sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b`.
   - If this total cost is less than `f`, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Condition for Charging:** The condition `if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is not correctly determining whether the phone should stay on or turn off and on. The correct approach should consider whether the phone can stay on until the next message without running out of charge.
2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation:** The cost calculation `sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b` does not accurately reflect the total energy required to send all messages. It does not account for the charge consumed during the intervals where the phone stays on.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Initialization:** Start with the initial charge `f`.
2. **Iterate Through Messages:** For each message time `m_i`:
   - Calculate the charge remaining if the phone stays on from the previous message time to `m_i`.
   - If the remaining charge is less than `b` (the cost to turn off and on), turn off and on the phone, resetting the charge to `f - b`.
   - Subtract the charge consumed from `m_{i-1}` to `m_i` from the current charge.
   - If at any point the charge becomes zero or negative, print "No".
3. **Final Check:** If all messages are sent without the charge dropping to zero or below, print "Yes".

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
