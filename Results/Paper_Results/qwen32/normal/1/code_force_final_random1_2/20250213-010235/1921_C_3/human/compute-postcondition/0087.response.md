Postcondition: **`t` is a variable, `array2` is an empty list, `n` (which is `feat[0]`) is greater than 0, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` is not equal to 0), `feat` is a list of integers where `feat[0]` is greater than 0, `a` is `feat[2]`, `arr` is a list of integers, and the current value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`.**
