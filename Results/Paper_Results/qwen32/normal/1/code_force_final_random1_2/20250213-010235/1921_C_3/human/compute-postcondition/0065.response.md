Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1
- `feat` is a list of integers
- `i` is 3
- `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1
- `f` is `feat[1]`
- `a` is `feat[2]`
- `b` is `feat[-1]`
- `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line
- `array2` is a list containing the element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`; otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.

Code Snippet:
```python
array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
```

Impact of the Code:
- The code appends the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to the list `array2`.

Output State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (unchanged)
- `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1 (unchanged)
- `feat` is a list of integers (unchanged)
- `i` is 3 (unchanged)
- `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1 (unchanged)
- `f` is `feat[1]` (unchanged)
- `a` is `feat[2]` (unchanged)
- `b` is `feat[-1]` (unchanged)
- `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line (unchanged)
- `array2` now contains the additional element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` contains the additional element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**
