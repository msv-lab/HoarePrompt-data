To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given code:

State before the loop starts: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `test_cases` is an integer read from input representing the number of test cases.
```python
for i in range(test_cases):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop, the variable `i` is the loop variable, and `test_cases` determines how many times the loop will iterate. The loop will execute if `test_cases` is at least 1.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop will execute if `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, so there's no need to set its initial value manually.
3. The variable `t` is mentioned but is not used in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `test_cases` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1**
