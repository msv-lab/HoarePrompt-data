To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3. The value of `n` does not change; it remains `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, `array2` is a list containing the element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.**
