The provided code snippet updates the `feat` list by reading a new line of input and splitting it into integers. This affects the values of `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` based on the new input.

Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are derived from the first input line. After executing the given code snippet, these values will be updated based on the second input line.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `i` is `feat[0] + 1`, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, and `array2` contains all values `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for which `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` was true during the iterations. The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is compared to `f`: if it is less than `f`, then the condition in the if part holds; otherwise, the condition in the else part holds.**

In natural language: The `feat` list is now updated with new integers from the input. The variables `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are reassigned to the new values from the `feat` list. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `i`, `arr`, `array2`) remain unchanged until further instructions modify them.
