The code appends the product of `arr[0]` and `a` to the `array2` list. The values of `t`, `n`, `b`, `f`, `a`, `feat`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The only change is that `array2` now includes a new element which is the product of `arr[0]` and `a`.

Output State: **`t` is a variable, `n` (which is `feat[0]`) is greater than 0, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `feat` is a list of integers where `feat[0]` > 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, and `array2` includes an additional element equal to `arr[0] * a`.**
