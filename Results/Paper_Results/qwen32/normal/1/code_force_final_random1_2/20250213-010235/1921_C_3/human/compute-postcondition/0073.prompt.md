Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `test_cases` is an integer read from input representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    n = feat[0]
    f = feat[1]
    a = feat[2]
    b = feat[-1]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    array2 = []
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
            array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
    if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input where the first element `n` is greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, and `array2` contains the elements `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is either less than `f` or greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `n` (since the loop runs until `i` reaches `n-1`), `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, and `array2` contains all values `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for which `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` was true during the iterations. The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is compared to `f`: if it is less than `f`, then the condition in the if part holds; otherwise, the condition in the else part holds.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers, `i` is `n`, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is a list containing all elements `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` for `i` ranging from `1` to `n-1`. Additionally, the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is compared to `f`: if it is less than `f`, the condition in the if part holds; otherwise, the condition in the else part holds.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
