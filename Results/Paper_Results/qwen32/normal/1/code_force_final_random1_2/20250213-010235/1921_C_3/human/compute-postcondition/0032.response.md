The given Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `array2`. This operation does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `i`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`). Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `array2` as an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 1 greater than its previous value, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is an empty list.**
