The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `feat`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
