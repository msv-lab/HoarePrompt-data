Postcondition: **`t` is a variable, `n` (which is `feat[0]`) is greater than 0, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `feat` is a list of integers where `feat[0]` > 0, and `arr` is a list of integers. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` has a new element appended, which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**
