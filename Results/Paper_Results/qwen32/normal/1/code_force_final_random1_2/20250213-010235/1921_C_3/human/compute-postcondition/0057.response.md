To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if the range `(1, n)` is valid, meaning `n` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1
- `feat` is a list of integers
- `i` is `feat[0] + 1`
- `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1
- `f` is `feat[1]`
- `a` is `feat[2]`
- `b` is `feat[-1]`
- `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line
- `array2` is an empty list

The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`. For this loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. The initial state already specifies that `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1. Therefore, no further adjustment is needed for `n`.

However, the initial value of `i` is given as `feat[0] + 1`. Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to adjust `i` to 1 before the loop begins.

Thus, the necessary adjustment is to set `i` to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is an empty list**
