Postcondition: **`t` is a variable, `array2` contains one element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, otherwise `array2` remains empty. `n` (which is `feat[0]`) is greater than 0, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `feat` is a list of integers where `feat[0]` is greater than 0, `a` is `feat[2]`, and `arr` is a list of integers.**
