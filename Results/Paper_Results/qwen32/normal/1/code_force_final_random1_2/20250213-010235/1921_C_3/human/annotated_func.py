#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains four integers n, f, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9. The second line contains n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        n = feat[0]
        
        f = feat[1]
        
        a = feat[2]
        
        b = feat[-1]
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        array2 = []
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
                array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `test_cases` number of times. For each test case, `feat` is a list of integers where `n` (first element) is greater than 1, `f` (second element) is a given threshold, `a` (third element) and `b` (last element) are coefficients. `arr` is a list of integers representing some sequence. `array2` is populated with values `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` where the difference `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`. After processing each test case, the program checks if the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`. If true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers (`n`, `f`, `a`, `b`) and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the differences between consecutive integers in the list and compares it to the threshold `f`. It prints "Yes" if the calculated value is less than `f`; otherwise, it prints "No".
