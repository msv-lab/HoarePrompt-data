### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem description and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Stepan needs to send `n` messages at specific moments `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`.
- The phone starts with `f` units of charge.
- The phone loses `a` units of charge per unit of time.
- Turning the phone off and on consumes `b` units of charge.
- Determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the energy required to send messages based on the time intervals between messages and the cost of turning the phone on and off.

Here's the key part of the program:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Energy Consumption**:
   - The program calculates the energy needed to send messages during intervals where the phone is on (`array2`).
   - However, it does not account for the energy consumed by turning the phone on and off correctly.
   
2. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The condition `if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:` checks if the interval is shorter than the energy cost of turning the phone on and off divided by the energy loss per unit time. This logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the energy consumption when the phone is turned on and off.
   - The program sums up the energy used during intervals where the phone is on but incorrectly adds the energy cost of turning the phone on and off for all messages, regardless of whether the phone was actually turned on and off.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The program does not consider scenarios where the phone might need to be turned off and on multiple times within a single test case.
   - It does not correctly simulate the process of turning the phone on and off to ensure that the charge never drops below zero.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 10 1 2
1 3 5
```
- Initial charge `f = 10`, charge loss per unit time `a = 1`, energy cost of turning on/off `b = 2`.
- Messages need to be sent at moments `1`, `3`, and `5`.

The program will calculate:
- Interval `1` to `3`: `2 * 1 = 2` (energy used during this interval).
- Interval `3` to `5`: `2 * 1 = 2` (energy used during this interval).

Total energy used during intervals: `2 + 2 = 4`.
Energy cost of turning on/off: `2 * 2 = 4` (since there are two turns on/off).

Total energy required: `4 + 4 = 8`.

Since `8 < 10`, the program will output `Yes`. However, this is incorrect because the phone will run out of charge if turned on and off multiple times.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the process of turning the phone on and off and keep track of the remaining charge. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        remaining_charge = f
        previous_time = 0
        
        for current_time in arr:
            # Calculate the energy loss since the last message or start
            energy_loss = (current_time - previous_time) * a
            
            # Check if we can send the message without turning off the phone
            if remaining_charge >= energy_loss:
                remaining_charge -= energy_loss
            else:
                # If not, turn off and on the phone
                remaining_charge = f - b - (current_time - previous_time) * a
                if remaining_charge <= 0:
                    print("NO")
                    break
            
            previous_time = current_time
        else:
            print("YES")

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly simulate the process of turning the phone on and off and does not handle the energy consumption accurately. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Final: False**
