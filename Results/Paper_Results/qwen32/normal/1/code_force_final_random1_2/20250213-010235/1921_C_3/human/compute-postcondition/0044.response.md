Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `n` (since the loop runs until `i` reaches `n-1`), `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, and `array2` contains all values `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for which `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` was true during the iterations. Additionally, the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`.**
