The given code snippet only contains the line `tot = 0`, which resets the variable `tot` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000); `x` is a list of integers with length `n`; `y` is a list of integers with length `n`; `r` is a list of integers with length `n`; `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except `visited[0]` which is `True` and `visited[1]` which is `True`. If `visited[1]` was `False` before the if statement, now `visited[1]` is `True` and `coef[1]` is `-1`. If `visited[1]` was already `True` before the if statement, there are no changes to `visited` or `coef`. `tot` is 0; `bipartite` is `True`; `ok` is `False`; `i` is 2; `coef[2]` is 1.**
