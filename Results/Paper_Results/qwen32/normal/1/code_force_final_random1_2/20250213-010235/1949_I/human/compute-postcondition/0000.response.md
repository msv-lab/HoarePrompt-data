The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is provided by the user input. All other variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`) remain unchanged.

Given that initially `n` was an integer such that `1 <= n <= 1000`, the new value of `n` will also be within this range, but it will be specifically the value provided by the user input.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000); `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers where `x[i], y[i]` are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and `r[i]` is the radius of the i-th disk, with `-10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9` and `1 <= r[i] <= 10^9` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`; `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to `False`; `coef` is a list of `None` values.**
