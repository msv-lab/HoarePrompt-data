The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]`. The initial state specifies that `x[i]` was `a`, `y[i]` was `b`, and `r[i]` was `c`. After executing the code, these values are replaced by the new integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer (within the range 1 to 1000), `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `x[i]` which is the first integer from the input, `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `y[i]` which is the second integer from the input, `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `r[i]` which is the third integer from the input, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `i` is `i + 1`**. 

In simpler terms, the elements `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are updated to the three integers provided in the input, while all other variables remain unchanged.
