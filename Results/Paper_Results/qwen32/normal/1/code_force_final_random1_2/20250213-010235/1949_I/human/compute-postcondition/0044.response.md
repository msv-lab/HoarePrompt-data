Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters as per the given signature. However, it operates on global variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`. It performs some computation or traversal (possibly Depth-First Search (DFS)) using these variables. The function does not return any value directly but modifies the `visited` and `coef` lists based on the properties of disks defined by their centers (`x`, `y`) and radii (`r`).**

Note: Since the function does not take parameters and the exact operations are not detailed, the description focuses on the implied usage of global variables and the potential side effects on `visited` and `coef`.
