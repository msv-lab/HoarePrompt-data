The function reads an integer `n` and a symmetric `n x n` matrix where each element is 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', representing the type of transition video between scenarios. It processes this matrix to replace '?' with either 'F' or 'S' based on certain conditions related to the counts of 'F' and 'S' in each row. The function then prints the modified matrix.
