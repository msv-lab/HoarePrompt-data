Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n+1`, `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1`, `xx` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, plus the current index `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are equal to 0, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and at the current index `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are equal to 0.**

In simpler terms, the index `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are zero has been added to the list `sa`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
