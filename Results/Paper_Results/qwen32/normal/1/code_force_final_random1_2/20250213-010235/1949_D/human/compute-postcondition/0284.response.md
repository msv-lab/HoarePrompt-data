The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. This changes the value of `nx` by adding 'S' to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is `k+1`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 1; `nx` has 'S' appended to its original value.**
