Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 6, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6, `nx` is an empty string
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sa[:n // 4] or j in sa[:n // 4]:
        nx += 'F'
    else:
        nx += 'S'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 6, `n` is greater than or equal to 6. If `xx[6][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` is the character at `xx[6][j - 1]`. If `xx[6][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`; otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 6, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `j` is 6, and `nx` is updated based on the value of `xx[6][5]`. Specifically, if `xx[6][5]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` is increased by `xx[6][5]`. Otherwise, `nx` has either 'F' or 'S' appended to it, depending on whether `i` or `j` is found in the first quarter of the list `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`). If `i` or `j` is found in `sa[:n // 4]`, 'F' is appended; otherwise, 'S' is appended.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 6, `n` is greater than or equal to 7, `j` is 7, and `nx` is updated based on the value of `xx[6][6]` if `xx[6][6]` is not equal to '?'. Otherwise, `nx` is updated based on the value of `xx[6][5]`. Specifically, if `xx[6][6]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is increased by `xx[6][6]`. If `xx[6][6]` is equal to '?', `nx` is updated based on whether `i` or `j` is found in the first quarter of the list `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`). If `i` or `j` is found in `sa[:n // 4]`, 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, if `xx[6][5]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is increased by `xx[6][5]`; if `xx[6][5]` is equal to '?', 'S' is appended to `nx`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
