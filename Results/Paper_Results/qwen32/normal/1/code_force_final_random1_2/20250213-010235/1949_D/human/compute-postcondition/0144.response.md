Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n+1`, `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1`, `xx` is a list containing `n+1` elements, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0` or `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `k + 1`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to `'?'`, `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][k]`. Otherwise, if `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, `'F'` is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, `'S'` is appended to `nx`.**
