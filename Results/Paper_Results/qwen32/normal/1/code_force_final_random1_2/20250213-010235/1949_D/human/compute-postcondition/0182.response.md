The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the existing string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after the operation, `nx` will be 'S'. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, `sa[:n // 4]`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 6, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `nx` is 'S', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'. Additionally, `i` is not in `sa[:n // 4]` and `j` is not in `sa[:n // 4]`.**
