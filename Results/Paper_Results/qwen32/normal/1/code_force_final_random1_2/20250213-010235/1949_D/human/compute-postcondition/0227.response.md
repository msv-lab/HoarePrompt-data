The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the existing value of `nx`. This means that whatever `nx` was before, it now has 'F' added to its end. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, and `sb` remain unchanged; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is incremented by 1; `nx` has 'F' appended to its original value.**
