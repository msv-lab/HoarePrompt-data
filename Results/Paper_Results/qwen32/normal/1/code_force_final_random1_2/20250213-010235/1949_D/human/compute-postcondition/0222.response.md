Postcondition: **`a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` remains unchanged, `sb` includes all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0` or both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are zero, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`. If either `i` or `j` (or both) is in the first quarter of `sb` (i.e., `i in sb[:n // 4]` or `j in sb[:n // 4]`), then `nx` is `'S'`. Otherwise, `nx` is `'F'`.**
