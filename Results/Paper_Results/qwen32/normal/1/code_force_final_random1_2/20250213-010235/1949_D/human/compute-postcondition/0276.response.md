The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was `n`, since the range is from `1` to `n + 1` (exclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it `n + 1`.

However, since the loop condition is `j` in the range from `1` to `n + 1` (exclusive), the loop will not execute when `j` is `n + 1`. Therefore, the loop will terminate after `j` reaches `n`.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would be the termination point) should reflect that `j` is `n + 1`.

State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is `k+1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `n + 1`**
