Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer read from the input, such that 2 <= n <= 24; `a` is a list of integers with length n+1; `b` is a list of integers with length n+1; `xx` is a list containing two elements, the first being an empty string and the second being the string `x`; `x` is a string read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of integers with length n+1 where the element at index `i` is incremented by 1 and the element at index `j` is incremented by 2 if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'F'. Otherwise, `b[i]` is incremented by 2 if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S'. `b` is a list of integers with length n+1, `xx` is a list containing two elements, the first being an empty string and the second being the string `x`, `x` is a string read from the input, and `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of integers with length n+1 where the element at index `i` is incremented by 1. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'F', the element at index `j` in `a` is incremented by 2; otherwise, `b[i]` is incremented by 2 if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S'. Additionally, if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1. `b` is a list of integers with length n+1, `xx` is a list containing two elements, the first being an empty string and the second being the string `x`, `x` is a string read from the input, and both `i` and `j` are incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of integers with length n+1, `b` is a list of integers with length n+1, `xx` is a list containing two elements, the first being an empty string and the second being the string `x`, `x` is a string read from the input, `j` is 4. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', the value at index 4 in `a` is increased by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', the value at index 4 in `b` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
