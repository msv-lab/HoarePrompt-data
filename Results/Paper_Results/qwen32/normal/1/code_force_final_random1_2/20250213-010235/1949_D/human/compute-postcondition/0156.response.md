The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Given that `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing the code, `nx` will be 'S'. The values of `i`, `n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, and the conditions related to `sa` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`. Additionally, `i` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` and `j` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.**
