The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` increments the variable `nx` by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. The variables `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, and `sb` remain unchanged. The variables `i` and `j` are incremented by 1 before this operation, so we use their incremented values in the expression.

Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, this condition remains valid. The only variable that changes its value is `nx`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `j` is incremented by 1; `nx` is incremented by `xx[i][j - 1]`.**
