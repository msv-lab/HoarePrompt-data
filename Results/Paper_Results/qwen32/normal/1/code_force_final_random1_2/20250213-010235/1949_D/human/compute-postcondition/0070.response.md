Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of integers with length n+1, `b` is a list of integers with length n+1 where `b[n]` is incremented by 1 and `b[j]` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `j-1` in the string `x` is 'S', `xx` is a list containing three elements: an empty string, the string `x`, and the string `x`, `x` is the newly input string, `i` is n, and the character at index `j-1` in the string `x` is not 'F'.**
