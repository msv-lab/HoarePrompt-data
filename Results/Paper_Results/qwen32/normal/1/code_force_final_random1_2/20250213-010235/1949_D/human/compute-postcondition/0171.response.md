To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each iteration based on the given conditions. The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n` (inclusive). During each iteration, it checks the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` and appends a character to `nx` based on specific conditions.

Here's a summary of the loop's behavior:
1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', it appends `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`.
2. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', it checks if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`. If true, it appends 'F' to `nx`; otherwise, it appends 'S'.

Since `i` remains constant (`i = n`) throughout the loop, the decision to append 'F' or 'S' depends on whether `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.

After all iterations (from `j = 1` to `j = n`), `nx` will be a string of length `n` composed of characters from `xx[n]` (if they are not '?') or 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions mentioned above.

### Final Output State:
The final output state is that `nx` is a string of length `n`, constructed by appending characters according to the rules specified in the loop. The variable `i` remains `n`.

**Output State:** **`nx` is a string of length `n` constructed by appending characters from `xx[n]` or 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions, and `i` is `n`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `nx` will be a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[n]` or by the rules involving 'F' and 'S' based on the position `j` and the list `sa`.
