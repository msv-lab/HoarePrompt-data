Postcondition: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, and `sb` remain unchanged. `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, then `nx` is `'' + xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`, then `nx` is `'S'` if either `i` or `j` (or both) is in the first quarter of `sb` (i.e., `i in sb[:n // 4]` or `j in sb[:n // 4]`); otherwise, `nx` is `'F'`.**
