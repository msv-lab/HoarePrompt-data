The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character `'F'` to the string `nx`. Given that `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `nx` will be `'F'`.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, and the condition involving `sa`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`nx` is `'F'`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`. Additionally, either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` up to the index `n // 4`.**
