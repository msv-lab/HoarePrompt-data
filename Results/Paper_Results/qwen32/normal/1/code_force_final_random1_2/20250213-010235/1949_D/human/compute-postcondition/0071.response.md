Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where the element at index `j` is incremented by 1 if the character at position `j-1` in the string `x` is 'F'; `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where `b[n]` is incremented by 1 and `b[j]` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `j-1` in the string `x` is 'S'; `xx` is a list containing three elements: an empty string, the string `x`, and the string `x`; `x` is the newly input string; `i` is `n`.**
