Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of integers with length n+1 where the element at index `i` is incremented by 1. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'F', the element at index `j` in `a` is incremented by 2; otherwise, `b[i]` is incremented by 2 if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S'. Additionally, if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1. `b` is a list of integers with length n+1, `xx` is a list containing two elements, the first being an empty string and the second being the string `x`, `x` is a string read from the input, and both `i` and `j` are incremented by 1.**
