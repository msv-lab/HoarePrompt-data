Postcondition: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is `k+1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` is set to `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is set to 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`; otherwise, `nx` is set to 'F'.**
