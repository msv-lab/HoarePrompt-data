To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`, but `i` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. The variable `j` is the loop variable that gets incremented with each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have taken on the value `n` (since the loop runs from `1` to `n` inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be set to the starting value of the loop, which is `1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `j` at the end of the previous iteration was `n`.
2. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be reset to `1` because the loop starts from `1`.
3. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where the element at index `j` is incremented by 1 if the character at position `j-1` in the string `x` is 'F'; `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where `b[n]` is incremented by 1 and `b[j]` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `j-1` in the string `x` is 'S'; `xx` is a list containing three elements: an empty string, the string `x`, and the string `x`; `x` is the newly input string; `j` is 1**
