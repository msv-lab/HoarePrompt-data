Postcondition: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is the character at position `j - 1` in the string `xx[i]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is "S" if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, otherwise `nx` is 'F'.**
