The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `nx`, we can only say that `nx` now has its previous value with 'S' appended to it. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is incremented by 1; `nx` has its previous value with 'S' appended to it.**
