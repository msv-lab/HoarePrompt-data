The given Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `sa`. This action does not affect the existing variables `a`, `b`, or `xx`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'F's involving scenario `j-1`; `b` is a list of integers with length `n+1` where each element at index `j` is the total count of 'S's involving scenario `j-1`; `xx` is a list containing `n+1` elements, the first being an empty string and the next `n` being the input strings; `sa` is an empty list.**
