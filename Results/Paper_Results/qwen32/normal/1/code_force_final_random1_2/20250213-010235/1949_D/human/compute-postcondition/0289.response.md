To determine the output of the `print(nx)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the construction of the `nx` string.

### Initial State Recap:
- `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged.
- `i` is set to `k+1`.
- `nx` is a string constructed by appending characters from `xx[i]` or 'S'/'F' based on certain conditions.

### Construction of `nx`:
The construction of `nx` involves iterating through the string `xx` starting from index `i` (which is `k+1`). For each character in `xx` starting from `xx[k+1]`, a decision is made to either append the character itself or append 'S' or 'F' based on some conditions related to `sa` and `sb`.

However, the specific conditions for appending 'S' or 'F' are not detailed in the provided initial state. Therefore, we can only describe `nx` in terms of how it is constructed rather than providing an exact string.

### Explanation:
Given that `nx` is constructed by potentially modifying or directly taking characters from `xx` starting from index `k+1`, the output will depend on the contents of `xx` and the conditions for appending 'S' or 'F'. Since these details are not provided, we can describe `nx` as follows:

- `nx` starts from the character at index `k+1` of `xx`.
- For each subsequent character in `xx` starting from `xx[k+1]`, either the character itself or 'S'/'F' is appended to `nx` based on the unspecified conditions involving `sa` and `sb`.

### Final Output:
Without the specific conditions and the content of `xx`, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **nx (where nx is a string constructed from xx starting at index k+1, with potential modifications based on conditions involving sa and sb)**
