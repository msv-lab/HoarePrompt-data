The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. However, the initial state does not specify the initial value of `nx`. Therefore, we can only state that `nx` will have its original value with 'F' appended to it. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 6, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `j` is 6, `nx` is the original value of `nx` with 'F' appended**.
