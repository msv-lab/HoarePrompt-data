Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of integers with length n+1, `b` is a list of integers with length n+1, `xx` is a list containing two elements, the first being an empty string and the second being the string `x`, `x` is a string read from the input, `j` is 4. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', the value at index 4 in `a` is increased by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', the value at index 4 in `b` is increased by 1.**
