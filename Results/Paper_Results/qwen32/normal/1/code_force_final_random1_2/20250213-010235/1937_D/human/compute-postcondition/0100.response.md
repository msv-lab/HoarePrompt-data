Postcondition: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `l` is greater than 0, `r` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to '>', `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is `1 + 2i` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0.**
