The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of the variable `r` by 1. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `r`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `r` after the operation. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 2, `r` is decreased by 1.**
