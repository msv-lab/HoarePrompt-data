To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```
x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
```

We need to know the values or properties of `A` and `idx_A` to compute `x`. However, these are not provided in the initial state. Given the lack of specific information about `A` and `idx_A`, we can only express `x` in terms of these variables.

Here's what we know:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is greater than 5.
- `i` is 5.

Let's denote:
- `A[len(A) - 1]` as the last element of list `A`.
- `idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]` as the last element of list `idx_A`.

Thus, the expression for `x` can be written as:
```
x = A[-1] + (5 - idx_A[-1]) * len(idx_A)
```

Since we don't have specific values for `A` and `idx_A`, we can't compute a numerical value for `x`. We can only express `x` in terms of these lists.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 5; `i` is 5; `x` is `A[-1] + (5 - idx_A[-1]) * len(idx_A)`**.
