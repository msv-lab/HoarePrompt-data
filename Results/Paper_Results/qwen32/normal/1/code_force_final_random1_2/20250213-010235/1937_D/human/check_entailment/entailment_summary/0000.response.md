### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze whether it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and the code:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a grid of cells, each containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on a cell moves left or right based on the character in that cell.
   - After each move, the character in the cell is inverted.
   - We need to determine how long it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Approach:**
   - The code uses two arrays, `A` and `B`, to keep track of cumulative movements for '>' and '<' respectively.
   - It iterates through the string `s` twice: once from left to right to fill `A` and once from right to left to fill `B`.
   - For each cell, it calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid based on the precomputed values in `A` and `B`.

3. **Code Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes two lists, `A` and `B`, to store cumulative movements.
   - It fills `A` with cumulative movements for '>' characters.
   - It fills `B` with cumulative movements for '<' characters.
   - It then uses these cumulative movements to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

4. **Execution Summary:**
   - The execution summary indicates that the function processes the string `s` and produces a sequence of numbers based on the arrangement of '<' and '>' characters.
   - This aligns with the expected behavior of calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

5. **Verification:**
   - The provided example input-output pairs match the expected results, suggesting that the code correctly implements the logic.
   - The code handles edge cases such as when there are no '>' or '<' characters, and when the pinball immediately leaves the grid.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position using precomputed cumulative movements.

**Correctness: True**
