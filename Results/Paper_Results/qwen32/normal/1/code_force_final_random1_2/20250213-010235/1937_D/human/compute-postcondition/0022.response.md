The code snippet `A.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `A`. This means that the list `A` will now contain an additional element, which is `0`. The variables `s`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 5; `i` is 5; `A` contains an additional element `0`.**
