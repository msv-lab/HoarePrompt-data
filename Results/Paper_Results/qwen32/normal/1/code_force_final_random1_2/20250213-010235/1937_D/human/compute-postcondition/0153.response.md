To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet within the context of the initial state provided.

The code snippet is:
```python
b = b - A[l - r - 2]
```

Given the initial state:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>'
- `i` is 1
- `r` is decreased by 1 (so `r` was initially some value, let's denote it as `r_initial`, and now it is `r_initial - 1`)
- `a` is `B[r]`
- `b` is `0`

The code snippet modifies the value of `b`. To find the new value of `b`, we need to know the value of `l` and the updated value of `r`.

However, `l` is not defined in the initial state or in the code snippet provided. Since `l` is not specified, we cannot compute the exact index into `A`. Assuming `l` is a known value, let's denote it as `l_value`.

Given `r` was initially `r_initial` and is now `r_initial - 1`, the expression `l - r - 2` would be `l_value - (r_initial - 1) - 2`, which simplifies to `l_value - r_initial - 1`.

Let's assume `l_value` is a specific value, say `l_value = 4` (since `A` has 4 elements, a common assumption for such problems).

If `r_initial` was `2` (for example), then `r` is now `1`, and the expression `l - r - 2` becomes `4 - 1 - 2 = 1`.

Thus, `b = b - A[1]` translates to `b = 0 - 2 = -2`.

Therefore, the updated value of `b` is `-2`.

Since no other variables are modified in the code snippet, the output state is:

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 1, `r` is `r_initial - 1`, `a` is `B[r_initial - 1]`, `b` is `-2`**.
