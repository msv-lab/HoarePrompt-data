The code appends the value `0` to the list `A`. Since the initial state does not mention `A`, we assume `A` is a list that exists in the environment. The values of `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 4; `A` is a list with an additional element `0` appended to it.**
