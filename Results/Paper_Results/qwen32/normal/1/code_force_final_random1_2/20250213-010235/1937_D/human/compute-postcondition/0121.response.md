The given code snippet assigns a value to `x` based on the expression `r - (l + 2)`. However, the variables `r` and `l` are not defined in the initial state, which means their values are unknown. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `x`.

Given that the values of `r` and `l` are not specified, the output state will reflect that `x` is calculated as `r - (l + 2)`.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 1, `a` is 2, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**.
