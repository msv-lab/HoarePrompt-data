To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information:

- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0 (specific value not given)
- `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>'
- `i` is 2

The print statement is:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

Here, `i` is explicitly given as 2. The value of `n` is not explicitly given but it is stated that `n` is greater than 0. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can only express the output in terms of `n`.

The expression `n - i` translates to `n - 2` because `i` is 2. Therefore, the print statement will output the result of `n - 2`.

Output: **n - 2 (where n is greater than 0)**
