The function `func_1` processes a string `s` composed of '<' and '>' characters. It calculates and prints a series of integer values based on the positions and counts of these characters in the string. The output depends on the arrangement of '<' and '>' characters, producing a sequence of numbers that reflect the balance or imbalance of these characters in the string.
