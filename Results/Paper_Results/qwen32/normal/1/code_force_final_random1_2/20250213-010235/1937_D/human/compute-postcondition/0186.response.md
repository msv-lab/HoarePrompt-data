To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

Initial State:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`
- `i` is 2
- `r` is decreased by 1
- `a` is `2 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`
- `b` is `B[r - 1]`

Code Snippet:
```python
b = b - B[r - l]
```

Let's identify the variables involved in the calculation:
- `b` is initially `B[r - 1]`
- `B[r - l]` is another element from the list `B`

Since `r` is decreased by 1, we need to know the value of `r` before it was decreased. Let's denote the original value of `r` as `r_original`. Thus, `r` is now `r_original - 1`.

Given that `b` is initially `B[r - 1]`, we can rewrite `b` as `B[(r_original - 1) - 1]` which simplifies to `B[r_original - 2]`.

Now, the code updates `b` to `b - B[r - l]`. Substituting the values, we get:
- `b` is initially `B[r_original - 2]`
- `B[r - l]` is `B[(r_original - 1) - l]`

Thus, the new value of `b` is `B[r_original - 2] - B[(r_original - 1) - l]`.

Since the exact value of `l` is not specified, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `b`. However, we can express the new value of `b` in terms of the elements of `B`.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 2, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `2 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[r - l]`**

In simpler terms, the value of `b` is updated to the difference between the element at index `r-1` and the element at index `r-l` in the list `B`. All other variables remain unchanged.
