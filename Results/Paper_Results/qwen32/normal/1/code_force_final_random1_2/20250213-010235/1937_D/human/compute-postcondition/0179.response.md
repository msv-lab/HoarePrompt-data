Postcondition: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 2. If `l < r`, then `a` is 4 and `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)`. If `l >= r`, then `a` is either 1, 1, 0, or -2 depending on the value of `r`, and `b` is `-r`.**
