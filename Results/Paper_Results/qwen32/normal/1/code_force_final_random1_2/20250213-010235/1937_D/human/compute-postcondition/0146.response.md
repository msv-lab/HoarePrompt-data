Postcondition: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is either -2, -6, -11, or -17 depending on the value of `l`, and `b` is either -3 - (idx_B[r - l] - 1) * (r - l) or -2 - (idx_B[r - l] - 1) * (r - l) if `r - l >= 0`. If `r - l < 0`, `b` remains unchanged.**
