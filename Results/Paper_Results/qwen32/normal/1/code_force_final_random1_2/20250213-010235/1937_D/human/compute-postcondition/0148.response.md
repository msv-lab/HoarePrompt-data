Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0 (specific value not given, but it's positive)
- `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>'
- `i` is 1
- `r` is decreased by 1 (we need to know the previous value of `r` to determine its current value)
- `a` is either -2, -6, -11, or -17 depending on the value of `l` (value of `l` not given)
- `b` is updated to `b_old + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` where `b_old` is the previous value of `b` and `r` is `r_old - 1`

### Key Variables:
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `r` is decreased by 1, so if `r_old` was initially 2, then `r` would now be 1.
- `a` depends on `l`, which is not specified, so we'll represent `a` as one of its possible values.
- `b` is updated based on the previous value of `b` (`b_old`), `idx_B[r]`, `i`, and `l`.

### Calculation of `b`:
Given `r` is now 1, `idx_B[r]` is `idx_B[1]` which is 2.
Assume `b_old` is some value `x` and `l` is some value `y`.
Then `b = x + (2 - 1) * y = x + y`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
```

Substituting the known values:
- `i` is 1.
- `b` is `x + y` (where `x` is `b_old` and `y` is `l`).
- `a` is one of {-2, -6, -11, -17}.

Let's consider one specific case for `a` and `b` to illustrate the calculation:
- Assume `a` is -6 (one of its possible values).
- Assume `b_old` (previous `b`) is 0 and `l` is 1 (for simplicity).

Then:
- `b = 0 + 1 * 1 = 1`.

Now substitute these into the print statement:
- `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 = (-6) * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 + 1 = -12 + 2 + 1 + 1 = -8`.

### General Case:
Without specific values for `a`, `b_old`, and `l`, the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` can be described generally as:
- `a * 2 + (b_old + (idx_B[r] - i) * l) * 2 + i + 1`.

### Final Output:
Since we don't have specific values for `a`, `b_old`, and `l`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

However, for the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `a = -6`, `b_old = 0`, and `l = 1` as shown above.

Output: **-8** (where `a` is -6, `b_old` is 0, `l` is 1, `i` is 1, and `r` is 1)

If we want to be more general:
Output: **a * 2 + (b_old + (idx_B[r] - i) * l) * 2 + i + 1** (where `a` is one of {-2, -6, -11, -17}, `b_old` is the previous value of `b`, `l` is a multiplier, `i` is 1, and `r` is 1)
