To determine the new value of `a`, we need to evaluate the expression `a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. However, the variable `l` is not defined in the initial state or the given code snippet. Since `l` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact new value of `a`. 

Given the lack of information about `l`, we can only express the new value of `a` in terms of `l`.

Let's assume `l` is a known value and proceed with the calculation:

1. `a` initially is 2.
2. `i` is 2.
3. `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7].

The expression for the new value of `a` is:
\[ a = 2 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l \]

Without knowing `l`, we can't compute the exact value, but we can express it as:
\[ a = 2 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l \]

Since `l` is not specified, let's assume `l` could be any valid index for `idx_A`. For example, if `l` were 1, then `idx_A[l - 1]` would be `idx_A[0]` which is 3. If `l` were 2, then `idx_A[l - 1]` would be `idx_A[1]` which is 5, and so on.

However, since `l` is not provided, we'll leave the expression in its general form.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 2, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is 2 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l**
