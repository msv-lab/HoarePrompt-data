To determine the new value of `b` after executing the given line of code, we need to substitute the known values into the expression:

Given:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 2
- `r` is `r_initial - 1`
- `a` is `B[r_initial - 1]`
- `b` is `4 - A[l - r_initial - 1]`

The line of code to execute is:
```python
b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
```

We need to know the values of `l` and `r_initial` to proceed. Since these are not specified, let's assume they are part of the context that remains unchanged and focus on how `b` changes.

Let's assume `l` and `r_initial` are such that we can compute the expression. For example, if `l` is 3 and `r_initial` is 2, then `r` would be 1 (`r_initial - 1`).

Substituting `l = 3` and `r = 1`:
- `idx_A[l - 1]` is `idx_A[2]` which is `6`
- `idx_A[l - r - 2]` is `idx_A[3 - 1 - 2]` which is `idx_A[0]` which is `3`
- `(l - r - 1)` is `(3 - 1 - 1)` which is `1`

So the expression becomes:
```python
b = b - (6 - 3) * 1
b = b - 3
```

If initially `b` was `4 - A[l - r_initial - 1]`, and assuming `l - r_initial - 1` is 0 (for simplicity, since exact value of `l` and `r_initial` are not provided), then `b` was initially `4 - A[0]` which is `4 - 0` which is `4`.

After the operation:
```python
b = 4 - 3
b = 1
```

Thus, the updated value of `b` is `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`; `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`; `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`; `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`; `n` is greater than 0; `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`; `i` is 2; `r` is `r_initial - 1`; `a` is `B[r_initial - 1]`; `b` is `1`**
