To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the specific print statement:

- **Variables and their values:**
  - `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
  - `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
  - `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
  - `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
  - `n` is greater than 0 (the exact value of `n` is not specified but it's irrelevant for this print statement)
  - `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', but the exact value of `s[i]` is not relevant for this print statement.
  - `i` is `2`
  - `r` is decreased by 1 (the exact value of `r` before and after this operation is not relevant for this print statement)

- **Print statement:**
  ```python
  print(i + 1, end=' ')
  ```

Given that `i` is `2`, the expression `i + 1` evaluates to `2 + 1`, which is `3`.

The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that a space should be used instead of a newline character after printing the value.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be `3` followed by a space.

Output: **3 **
