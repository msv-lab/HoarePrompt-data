To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information:

- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n` (exclusive).
- The loop variable is `i`.
- The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `A` is an empty list.
- `idx_A` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, the value of `n` must be at least 1 because the range function `range(0, n)` requires `n` to be greater than 0 to produce any values. The initial value of `i` doesn't need to be adjusted because it is set by the `range` function at the start of each iteration.

Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list**
