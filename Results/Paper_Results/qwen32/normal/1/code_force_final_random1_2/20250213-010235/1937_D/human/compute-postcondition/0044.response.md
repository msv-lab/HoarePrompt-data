The given code snippet appends `0` to the list `B`. This means that the length of `B` increases by one, and the last element of `B` becomes `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]
- `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 1 - j`
- `s[i]` is `<`
- If `len(idx_B)` was 0, then `B` is [0] and `idx_B` is `[i]`. Otherwise, `B` is not empty and includes the new element `x`, `idx_B` is not empty and includes `i` as its last element, and `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - (j + 1))) * len(idx_B)`.
- If `s[i]` is not `<`, there is no change to `B` or `idx_B`.
- `j` is incremented by 1.

After executing `B.append(0)`, the output state is:
- `A` remains [0, 2, 4, 7]
- `idx_A` remains [3, 5, 6, 7]
- `n` remains greater than 0
- `i` remains `n - 1 - j`
- `s[i]` remains `<`
- `B` now includes an additional `0` at the end, so if `B` was initially `[0]`, it becomes `[0, 0]`; if `B` was initially not empty, it becomes `[..., x, 0]`.
- `idx_B` remains unchanged as `i` is appended only when `s[i]` is `<`.
- `j` remains incremented by 1.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `s[i]` is `<`, `B` includes an additional `0` at the end, `idx_B` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1.**
