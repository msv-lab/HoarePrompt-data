Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `l` is `0`
- `r` is `4`
- `n` is greater than `0`
- `s[i]` is `'>'`
- `l` is not less than `r`
- `r` is not equal to `0`
- `a` is `6 - 4 * i`

Code Snippet:
```python
b = A[l - 1]
```

Since `l` is `0`, the expression `l - 1` evaluates to `-1`. In Python, accessing an array with an index of `-1` retrieves the last element of the array. Therefore, `b` is assigned the value of the last element of `A`, which is `7`.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`; `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`; `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`; `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`; `l` is `0`; `r` is `4`; `n` is greater than `0`; `s[i]` is `'>'`; `l` is not less than `r`; `r` is not equal to `0`; `a` is `6 - 4 * i`; `b` is `7`**.
