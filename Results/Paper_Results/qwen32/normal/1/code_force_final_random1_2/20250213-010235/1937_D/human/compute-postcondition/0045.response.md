To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

Given:
- `A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]
- `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 1 - j`
- `s[i]` is `<`
- If `len(idx_B)` was 0, then `B` is [0] and `idx_B` is `[i]`. Otherwise, `B` is not empty and includes the new element `x`, `idx_B` is not empty and includes `i` as its last element, and `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - (j + 1))) * len(idx_B)`.
- If `s[i]` is not `<`, there is no change to `B` or `idx_B`.
- `j` is incremented by 1.

The code snippet:
```python
x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
```

Since `s[i]` is `<`, the code snippet will execute and modify `x`. Let's break down the expression:

- `B[len(B) - 1]` is the last element of `B`.
- `idx_B[len(B) - 1]` is the last element of `idx_B`.
- `i` is `n - 1 - j`.
- `len(idx_B)` is the length of `idx_B`.

The new value of `x` is calculated using the formula:
```python
x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
```

After this calculation, `x` is updated, but `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged unless `x` is appended to `B` and `i` is appended to `idx_B` in subsequent code (which is not shown here).

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `x` while keeping other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `s[i]` is `<`, `B` is not empty and includes the new element `x`, `idx_B` is not empty and includes `i` as its last element, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `j` is incremented by 1.**
