Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `l` is 0, `r` is 4, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is `'>'`, `a` is 0, and `l` is less than `r`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of `A[l]`, which is `A[0]` or `0`. All other variables retain their initial values.
