Postcondition: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, and `s[i]` is `<`. If `len(idx_B)` is 0, then `B` is [0] and `idx_B` remains []. Otherwise, `B` is not empty and includes the new element `x`, `idx_B` is not empty, and `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - j)) * len(idx_B)`**
