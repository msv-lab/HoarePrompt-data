To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

Given:
- `A` is [0, 2, 4, 7]
- `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7]
- `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6]
- `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0]
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>'
- `i` is 1

The code snippet:
```python
a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
```

Here, `r` is not defined in the initial state, which means we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can express the output state in terms of `r`.

Let's break down the equation:
- `B[r - 1]`: This depends on the value of `r`.
- `idx_B[r - 1]`: This also depends on the value of `r`.
- `i` is given as 1.

So, the expression for `a` becomes:
```python
a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r
```

Since `r` is not specified, we cannot compute a numerical value for `a`. However, we can express `a` in terms of `r`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r`**.
