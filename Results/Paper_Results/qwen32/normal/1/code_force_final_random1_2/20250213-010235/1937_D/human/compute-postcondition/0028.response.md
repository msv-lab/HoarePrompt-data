To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop modifies the variables `A` and `idx_A` based on the characters in the string `s`.

Let's break down the loop step-by-step and understand how `A` and `idx_A` evolve:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `s`: A string of '<' and '>' characters.
   - `n`: Length of the string `s`.
   - `A`: An initially empty list.
   - `idx_A`: An initially empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each character in `s` from index `0` to `n-1`:
     - If the character is `'>':
       - If `idx_A` is empty, append `0` to `A`.
       - Otherwise, compute `x` as `A[-1] + (i - idx_A[-1]) * len(idx_A)` and append `x` to `A`.
       - Append the current index `i` to `idx_A`.

3. **Final State**:
   - The loop will iterate through every character in the string `s`.
   - `idx_A` will contain the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
   - `A` will contain computed values based on the positions of the '>' characters and their order.

### Example Calculation

Let's consider an example string `s = "<<<><>>>"`:

- **Iteration 1 (i=0)**: `s[0]` is '<', no changes to `A` and `idx_A`.
- **Iteration 2 (i=1)**: `s[1]` is '<', no changes to `A` and `idx_A`.
- **Iteration 3 (i=2)**: `s[2]` is '<', no changes to `A` and `idx_A`.
- **Iteration 4 (i=3)**: `s[3]` is '>', `idx_A` is empty, so `A` becomes `[0]` and `idx_A` becomes `[3]`.
- **Iteration 5 (i=4)**: `s[4]` is '<', no changes to `A` and `idx_A`.
- **Iteration 6 (i=5)**: `s[5]` is '>', `idx_A` is `[3]`, so `x = 0 + (5 - 3) * 1 = 2`, `A` becomes `[0, 2]` and `idx_A` becomes `[3, 5]`.
- **Iteration 7 (i=6)**: `s[6]` is '>', `idx_A` is `[3, 5]`, so `x = 2 + (6 - 5) * 2 = 4`, `A` becomes `[0, 2, 4]` and `idx_A` becomes `[3, 5, 6]`.
- **Iteration 8 (i=7)**: `s[7]` is '>', `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6]`, so `x = 4 + (7 - 6) * 3 = 7`, `A` becomes `[0, 2, 4, 7]` and `idx_A` becomes `[3, 5, 6, 7]`.

### Final Output State

After all iterations, the final state of the variables will be:
- `A`: `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A`: `[3, 5, 6, 7]`

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

Output State: **A: [0, 2, 4, 7], idx_A: [3, 5, 6, 7]**.

In natural language, this means that the list `A` contains the computed values `[0, 2, 4, 7]` based on the positions of the '>' characters in the string, and `idx_A` contains the indices `[3, 5, 6, 7]` where these '>' characters are located in the string.
