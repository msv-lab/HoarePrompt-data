Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `l` is 0, `r` is 4
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if l < r:
            a = A[l]
            x = r - (l + 2)
            b = B[r - 1]
            if x >= 0:
                b = b - B[x]
                b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
            b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 1]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1
        if l <= r:
            if l == 0:
                print(i + 1, end=' ')
            else:
                a = A[l - 1]
                a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l
                b = B[r]
                if r - l >= 0:
                    b = b - B[r - l]
                    b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)
                b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
                print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r]
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r - 1 > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 2]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, and `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>'. If `s[i]` is '>', `l` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is not '>', and `l <= r`, then if `l` is `0`, `r` remains `3`. If `l` is greater than `0`, `r` remains `3`, `a` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is set to `1 + 2i - il`. If `l > r`, then `l` is reset to `0`, and if `r` is not `0`, `r` remains `3` and `b` is set to `(i - 7) * 4`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is '>', `l` is incremented by 1. If `l < r`, `a` becomes 2 and `x` becomes `r - (l + 2)`, `b` becomes `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `l` is not less than `r` and `r` is not equal to 0, `a` becomes `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r`, `b` becomes `b + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `s[i]` is not '>', `r` is decremented by 1. If `l` is not equal to 0 and `l <= r`, `a` becomes either -2, -6, -11, or -17 depending on the value of `l`, and `b` is updated to `b_old + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `r` was initially 0 or `l > r`, `r` remains `r_initial - 1`. If `r` was not initially 0 and `l > r`, `a` becomes `B[r_initial - 1]`. Additionally, if `r_initial` is 2, `l` is 1, and `l > r`, `b` is -8.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 2`. If `s[i]` is `'>'`, then `l` is incremented by 1, and `r`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged. If `s[i]` is not `'>'`, and `l <= r`, then if `l` is 0, `r` is decremented by 1; otherwise, `r` is set to 1, `a` is calculated as `2 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is set to `2`. If `s[i]` is not `'>'`, and `l > r`, then if `r` was initially 0, the state remains unchanged; otherwise, `a` is set to `B[r_initial - 1]` and `b` is set to `1 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r_initial` if `b` was `1` or `4 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r_initial` if `b` was `4`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
