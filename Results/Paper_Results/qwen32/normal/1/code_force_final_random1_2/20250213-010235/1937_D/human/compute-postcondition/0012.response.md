The code snippet appends the current index `i` to the list `idx_A`. This means that `idx_A` will now contain the previous elements (if any) plus the new index `i`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `A` is a list containing either one element `0` or one element `[x]`.
- `idx_A` is either an empty list or not an empty list.
- The current character at index `i` in `s` is '>'.
- If `idx_A` is empty, `A` contains the single element `0`.
- Otherwise, `A` contains one element `[x]` where `x` is `0 + (i - idx_A_last) * len(idx_A)`.

After executing `idx_A.append(i)`, `idx_A` will have the new index `i` added to it. The values of `s`, `n`, and `A` remain unchanged unless further operations modify them.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is greater than 0; `A` is a list containing either one element `0` or one element `[x]`; `idx_A` is a list that includes the previous elements (if any) plus the new index `i`.**
