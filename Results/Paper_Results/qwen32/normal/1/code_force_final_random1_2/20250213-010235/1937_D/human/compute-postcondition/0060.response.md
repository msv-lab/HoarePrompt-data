The code assigns the length of list `B` to the variable `r`. Since `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, the length of `B` is 4. Therefore, `r` is now 4. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `l` is 0, `r` is 4**.
