To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `l` is `0`
- `r` is `0`
- `n` is greater than `0`
- `s[i]` is `'>'`
- `l` is not less than `r`

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables Involved**: 
   - `n`: This is stated to be greater than `0`, but no specific value is given.
   - `i`: This variable is referenced in the expression `n - i`, but it is not explicitly defined in the initial state.

2. **Missing Information**:
   - The value of `i` is crucial to determine the output of `n - i`. Since `i` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical result of `n - i`.

3. **Given Conditions**:
   - `l` is `0`
   - `r` is `0`
   - `l` is not less than `r`: This condition is satisfied since both `l` and `r` are `0`.

4. **Output Description**:
   - Given that `i` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `n` and `i`.

### Conclusion:
The output will be `n - i`, where `n` is a number greater than `0` and `i` is an unspecified integer.

Output: **n - i (where n is greater than 0 and i is an unspecified integer)**
