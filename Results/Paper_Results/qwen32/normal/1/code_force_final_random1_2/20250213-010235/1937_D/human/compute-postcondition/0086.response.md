Postcondition: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, and `s[i]` is `'>'`. If `l` is less than `r`, then `a` is 0, `x` is 2, `b` is `-i`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 0. If `l` is not less than `r`, then `b` is `b_initial + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `r` is 0, then `l` is 0.**
