To determine the new state after executing the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the code and the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
b = A[l - 1]
```

Given the initial state:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`
- `i` is 1
- `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r`

The variable `l` is not defined in the initial state, which means we cannot determine its exact value. However, since the problem asks us to provide the output state based on the given information, we'll assume `l` is a valid index for the list `A`.

Let's consider the possible values for `l` and their corresponding impacts:

1. If `l` is 1, then `b` would be `A[0]` which is `0`.
2. If `l` is 2, then `b` would be `A[1]` which is `2`.
3. If `l` is 3, then `b` would be `A[2]` which is `4`.
4. If `l` is 4, then `b` would be `A[3]` which is `7`.

Since the exact value of `l` is not specified, we can only express `b` in terms of `l`. The value of `b` is `A[l - 1]`.

Therefore, the output state, considering the possible values of `l`, is:

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1]`**
