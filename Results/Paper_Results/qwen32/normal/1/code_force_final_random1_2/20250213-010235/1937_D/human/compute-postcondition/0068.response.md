The code snippet `b = b - B[x]` subtracts the value of `B[x]` from `b`. Given the initial state, `x` is 2 and `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`. Therefore, `B[x]` is `B[2]`, which is `3`. The initial value of `b` is `6`. After the operation, `b` becomes `6 - 3`, which is `3`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `l` is 0, `r` is 4, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is `'>'`, `a` is 0, `x` is 2, `b` is 3, and `l` is less than `r`. Additionally, `x` is greater than or equal to 0.**
