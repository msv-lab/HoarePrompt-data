To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet in the context of the initial state provided.

The code snippet modifies the variable `b` based on the current value of `b` and the difference between elements in `idx_A` array, scaled by `(l - r)`.

Given:
- `b` is initially `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>'
- `i` is 2
- `a` is either 1, 1, 0, or -2 depending on the value of `r`

The code snippet:
```python
b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)
```

Since the values of `l` and `r` are not specified, let's assume generic values for `l` and `r` to illustrate the transformation. For simplicity, let's assume `l = 3` and `r = 1`.

Then:
- `A[l - 1]` is `A[2]` which is `4`
- `A[l - r - 1]` is `A[1]` which is `2`
- `idx_A[l - 1]` is `idx_A[2]` which is `6`
- `idx_A[l - r - 1]` is `idx_A[1]` which is `5`
- `l - r` is `3 - 1` which is `2`

Thus:
- `b` is initially `A[2] - A[1]` which is `4 - 2` which is `2`
- `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1])` is `(6 - 5)` which is `1`
- `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` is `1 * 2` which is `2`

So the new value of `b` is:
- `b = 2 - 2` which is `0`

Therefore, the updated value of `b` is `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 2, `a` is either 1, 1, 0, or -2 depending on the value of `r`, `b` is 0**.
