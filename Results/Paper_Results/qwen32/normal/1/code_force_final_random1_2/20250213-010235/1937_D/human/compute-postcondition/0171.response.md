To determine the output state, let's evaluate the given code snippet with the provided initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `i` is `2`
- `r` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is implied to be used in the code snippet. Since `r` is used as an index, it must be a valid index for the lists `B` and `idx_B`.

Let's assume `r` is a variable that holds a value between 1 and 4 (inclusive), as these are the valid indices for the lists `B` and `idx_B`. For the sake of this example, let's consider each possible value of `r`:

1. If `r` is 1:
   ```python
   a = B[0] + (idx_B[0] - i) * 1
   a = 0 + (3 - 2) * 1
   a = 0 + 1
   a = 1
   ```

2. If `r` is 2:
   ```python
   a = B[1] + (idx_B[1] - i) * 2
   a = 1 + (2 - 2) * 2
   a = 1 + 0
   a = 1
   ```

3. If `r` is 3:
   ```python
   a = B[2] + (idx_B[2] - i) * 3
   a = 3 + (1 - 2) * 3
   a = 3 + (-1) * 3
   a = 3 - 3
   a = 0
   ```

4. If `r` is 4:
   ```python
   a = B[3] + (idx_B[3] - i) * 4
   a = 6 + (0 - 2) * 4
   a = 6 + (-2) * 4
   a = 6 - 8
   a = -2
   ```

Since `r` is not specified, we cannot determine a single value for `a`. However, we can express the possible values of `a` based on the possible values of `r`.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 2, `a` is either 1, 1, 0, or -2 depending on the value of `r`.**

In natural language: The value of `a` depends on the value of `r`. If `r` is 1, `a` is 1. If `r` is 2, `a` is 1. If `r` is 3, `a` is 0. If `r` is 4, `a` is -2. All other variables remain unchanged.
