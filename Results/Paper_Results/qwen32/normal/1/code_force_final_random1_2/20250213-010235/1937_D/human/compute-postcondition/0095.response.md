Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state:

Initial State: 
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `l` is greater than 0
- `r` is 3
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[i]` is not equal to '>'
- `a` is `A[l - 1]`

The code snippet modifies the value of `a`:
```python
a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l
```

Let's break down the changes:
- `a` is initially set to `A[l - 1]`. Since `l` is greater than 0, `l - 1` is a valid index for `A`.
- The new value of `a` is calculated as `a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.

Since the exact value of `l` and `i` are not specified, we'll express the new value of `a` in terms of these variables.

The new value of `a` is:
\[ a = A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) \times l \]

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `l` is greater than 0, `r` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to '>', `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`**.

This means that `a` has been updated to the new value based on the given formula, while all other variables remain unchanged.
