Postcondition: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, and `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>'. If `s[i]` is '>', `l` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is not '>', and `l <= r`, then if `l` is `0`, `r` remains `3`. If `l` is greater than `0`, `r` remains `3`, `a` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is set to `1 + 2i - il`. If `l > r`, then `l` is reset to `0`, and if `r` is not `0`, `r` remains `3` and `b` is set to `(i - 7) * 4`.**
