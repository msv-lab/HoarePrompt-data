To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

Here's the given state before the loop starts:
- `A`: [0, 2, 4, 7]
- `idx_A`: [3, 5, 6, 7]
- `B`: []
- `idx_B`: []

And the loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 because `range(0, n)` generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `n`.
- The variable `j` is initialized to 0 in the first iteration of the loop, so there's no need to set an initial value for `j` before the loop starts.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `n` is greater than 0. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` do not affect the execution of this particular loop, as they are not referenced in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [], `idx_B` is [], `n` must be greater than 0**
