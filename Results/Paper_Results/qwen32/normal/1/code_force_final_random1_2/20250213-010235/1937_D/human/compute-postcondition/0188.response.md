Postcondition: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either `'>'` or not `'>'`, `i` is 2, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `2 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is `2` if `r - l >= 0`. Otherwise, `b` retains its original value as `B[r - 1]`.**
