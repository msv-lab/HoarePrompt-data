The given code snippet assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to `b`. Given that `l` is `0`, `l - 1` evaluates to `-1`. In Python, accessing an array with an index of `-1` retrieves the last element of the array. Therefore, `A[l - 1]` is equivalent to `A[-1]`, which is `7`.

Thus, `b` is assigned the value `7`.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`, `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`, `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`, `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, `l` is `0`, `r` is `3`, `n` is greater than `0`, `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`, `r` is not equal to `0`, `a` is `6`, `b` is `7`**.
