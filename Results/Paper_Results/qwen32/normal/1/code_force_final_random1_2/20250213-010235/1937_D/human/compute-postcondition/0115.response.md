Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `A` is `[0, 2, 4, 7]`
- `idx_A` is `[3, 5, 6, 7]`
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `idx_B` is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`
- `l` is `0`
- `r` is `3`
- `n` is greater than `0`
- `s[i]` is not equal to `'>'`
- `r` is not equal to `0`
- `b` is `(i - 7) * 4`

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `a`**: This variable is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, it is impossible to determine its value from the given information. We will assume `a` is a variable with some unknown value.

2. **Variable `b`**: The value of `b` is defined as `(i - 7) * 4`. However, the value of `i` is not provided in the initial state. Thus, `b` cannot be precisely determined without knowing `i`.

3. **Variable `n`**: It is mentioned that `n` is greater than `0`, but its exact value is not specified.

4. **Variable `i`**: The value of `i` is not provided, and it is crucial for determining the value of `b` and the final expression.

Given these uncertainties, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables involved:

- `a * 2`: This term represents twice the value of `a`.
- `b * 2`: This term represents twice the value of `b`, which is `2 * (i - 7) * 4 = 8 * (i - 7)`.
- `(n - i)`: This term represents the difference between `n` and `i`.

### Final Expression:
The expression inside the `print` statement is `a * 2 + 8 * (i - 7) + (n - i)`.

### Conclusion:
Since `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i` are not fully defined in the initial state, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **a * 2 + 8 * (i - 7) + (n - i) (where a is an unknown variable, i is an unknown index, n is a positive integer greater than 0)**
