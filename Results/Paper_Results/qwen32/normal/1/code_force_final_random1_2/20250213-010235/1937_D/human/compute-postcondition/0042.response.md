The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was some value such that the loop just finished executing for that `j`. Since the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`, the next value of `j` should be incremented by 1.

Given that `i` is defined as `n - 1 - j`, when `j` is incremented by 1, `i` will be decremented by 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`, and `s[i]` is `<`. If `len(idx_B)` was 0, then `B` is [0] and `idx_B` is `[i]`. Otherwise, `B` is not empty and includes the new element `x`, `idx_B` is not empty and includes `i` as its last element, and `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - (j + 1))) * len(idx_B)`. If `s[i]` is not `<`, there is no change to `B` or `idx_B`. `j` is `j + 1`**

However, since we don't know the exact value of `j` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1 - (j + 1)`, and `s[i]` is `<`. If `len(idx_B)` was 0, then `B` is [0] and `idx_B` is `[i]`. Otherwise, `B` is not empty and includes the new element `x`, `idx_B` is not empty and includes `i` as its last element, and `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - (j + 1))) * len(idx_B)`. If `s[i]` is not `<`, there is no change to `B` or `idx_B`. `j` is incremented by 1**
