To determine the new value of `b` after executing the line `b = b - B[r - l]`, we need to consider the current values of `b`, `B`, `r`, and `l`.

Given:
- `B` is `[0, 1, 3, 6]`
- `b` is `B[r]`
- `r` is decreased by 1, so if `r` was initially some value `x`, now `r` is `x - 1`.
- `l` can be one of the values `-2, -6, -11, -17`.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:

1. **Determine `r` after decrement:**
   - If `r` was initially `3`, now `r` is `2`.
   - If `r` was initially `2`, now `r` is `1`.
   - If `r` was initially `1`, now `r` is `0`.
   - If `r` was initially `0`, now `r` is `-1` (though this would be out of bounds for `B`).

2. **Calculate `b` before the operation:**
   - If `r` was initially `3`, `b` was `B[3]` which is `6`.
   - If `r` was initially `2`, `b` was `B[2]` which is `3`.
   - If `r` was initially `1`, `b` was `B[1]` which is `1`.
   - If `r` was initially `0`, `b` was `B[0]` which is `0`.

3. **Calculate `b` after the operation `b = b - B[r - l]`:**
   - For each possible value of `l` (`-2, -6, -11, -17`), compute `r - l` and find `B[r - l]`.
   - Subtract `B[r - l]` from the current `b`.

Let's go through each case:

### Case 1: `r` was initially `3` (now `r` is `2`)
- `b` was `6`.
- Possible values of `r - l`:
  - `2 - (-2) = 4` (out of bounds)
  - `2 - (-6) = 8` (out of bounds)
  - `2 - (-11) = 13` (out of bounds)
  - `2 - (-17) = 19` (out of bounds)
- Since all values are out of bounds, let's assume `r` was not `3`.

### Case 2: `r` was initially `2` (now `r` is `1`)
- `b` was `3`.
- Possible values of `r - l`:
  - `1 - (-2) = 3` â†’ `B[3] = 6`
  - `1 - (-6) = 7` (out of bounds)
  - `1 - (-11) = 12` (out of bounds)
  - `1 - (-17) = 18` (out of bounds)
- Valid operation: `b = 3 - 6 = -3`

### Case 3: `r` was initially `1` (now `r` is `0`)
- `b` was `1`.
- Possible values of `r - l`:
  - `0 - (-2) = 2` â†’ `B[2] = 3`
  - `0 - (-6) = 6` (out of bounds)
  - `0 - (-11) = 11` (out of bounds)
  - `0 - (-17) = 17` (out of bounds)
- Valid operation: `b = 1 - 3 = -2`

### Case 4: `r` was initially `0` (now `r` is `-1`)
- This case is invalid since `r` would be out of bounds.

Thus, the valid scenarios are when `r` was initially `2` or `1`. Given these scenarios, `b` can be either `-3` or `-2`.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is either -2, -6, -11, or -17 depending on the value of `l`, `b` is either -3 or -2**.
