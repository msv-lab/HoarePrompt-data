The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `n`, `s[i]`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is [0, 2, 4, 7], `idx_A` is [3, 5, 6, 7], `B` is [0, 1, 3, 6], `idx_B` is [3, 2, 1, 0], `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is either '>' or not '>', `i` is 1, `r` is decreased by 1.**
