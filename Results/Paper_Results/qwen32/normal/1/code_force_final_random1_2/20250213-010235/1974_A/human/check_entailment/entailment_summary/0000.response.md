Let's analyze the provided Python program and compare it with the problem requirements and the given execution summary.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We have a grid of size 5x3 (15 cells).
- We need to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons.
- The goal is to minimize the number of screens used.

### Key Observations:
- A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
- A 5x3 screen has 15 cells.
- If we place `y` 2x2 icons, they will occupy `4*y` cells.
- The remaining cells can be filled with 1x1 icons.

### Calculation Breakdown:
1. **Placing 2x2 Icons:**
   - Each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells.
   - To fit `y` 2x2 icons, we need at least `ceil(y / 2)` screens because each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons (8 cells).

2. **Remaining Cells for 1x1 Icons:**
   - After placing `y` 2x2 icons, the remaining cells in those screens can be used for 1x1 icons.
   - If we place `y` 2x2 icons, they occupy `4*y` cells.
   - The remaining cells are `15*z - 4*y`, where `z` is the number of screens used for 2x2 icons.
   - If `m` (remaining cells) is less than `x` (number of 1x1 icons), we need additional screens for the remaining 1x1 icons.

### Analysis of Provided Code:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2  # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        m = 15 * z - y * 4  # Calculate remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        if m < x:  # If remaining cells are less than 1x1 icons needed
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15  # Add additional screens for 1x1 icons
        print(z)
```
- The code correctly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons using `(y + 1) // 2`.
- It then calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
- If the remaining cells are insufficient for all 1x1 icons, it adds additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

### Conclusion:
The logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem requirements and correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for any given test case.

**Correctness: True**
