The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. This means the values of `x` and `y` will be updated based on the input provided, while the other variables (`t`, `a`, `z`, `m`, and `i`) remain unchanged unless further operations are performed on them.

Given the initial state, the only variables that will be updated are `x` and `y`. The values of `z` and `m` are dependent on `y`, but since `y` is being reassigned, `z` and `m` would need to be recalculated if used later in the program. However, based on the provided code snippet alone, `z` and `m` are not recalculated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are the integers read from the input, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`. If `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is updated to `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15`, `i` is `i + 1`**
