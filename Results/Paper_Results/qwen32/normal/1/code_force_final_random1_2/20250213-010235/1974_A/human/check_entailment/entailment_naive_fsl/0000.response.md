Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a grid of size 5x3 (15 cells).
- We need to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on these grids.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)
```

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons (`z` calculation):**
   - `z = (y + 1) // 2`: This formula does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for `y` 2x2 icons.
     - For example, if `y = 1`, `z` becomes `1`, which is correct.
     - But if `y = 2`, `z` becomes `1`, which is incorrect because 2 2x2 icons require 2 screens.
     - The correct formula should be `z = (y + 1) // 2` but this needs to be re-evaluated in context.
   
2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Space (`m` calculation):**
   - `m = 15 * z - y * 4`: This formula calculates the remaining space after placing `y` 2x2 icons.
     - However, it does not correctly account for the fact that placing 2x2 icons may leave irregular spaces that cannot be filled by 1x1 icons.
   
3. **Incorrect Adjustment for 1x1 Icons (`if m < a` condition):**
   - `if m < a:` This condition is incorrect and does not properly handle the placement of 1x1 icons.
     - The variable `a` represents the number of test cases, not the remaining space.
     - The condition should check if there is enough space for 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons.

### Correct Approach:
1. Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons.
2. Calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons.
3. Place 1x1 icons in the remaining space.
4. If there is not enough space, add additional screens.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

#### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons and does not properly handle the placement of 1x1 icons in the remaining space. As a result, it fails to provide the correct minimum number of screens for various inputs.
