### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and see if it correctly computes the minimum number of screens needed for each test case.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, which represent the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Screens Needed for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates `z = (y + 1) // 2`. This formula is used to determine the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate the 2x2 icons. The idea here is to pair up 2x2 icons where possible, and if there's an odd number of 2x2 icons, an additional screen is needed for the remaining one. This is because each screen can hold at most 4 2x2 icons (filling up the entire screen), so `(y + 1) // 2` effectively counts the number of pairs plus any leftover single 2x2 icon.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The program calculates `m = 15 * z - y * 4`. Here, `15 * z` represents the total number of cells available on `z` screens (since each screen has 15 cells). Subtracting `y * 4` gives the remaining number of cells after placing all the 2x2 icons. If `m` is negative or zero, it means all cells are occupied by 2x2 icons, and no additional space is available for 1x1 icons.

4. **Adjusting for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `m < x`, it means the remaining space is insufficient to place all 1x1 icons. Therefore, the program adjusts `z` by adding `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`. This formula calculates how many additional screens are needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons. The term `x - m` gives the number of 1x1 icons that still need placement, and `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` computes the number of full screens needed for these icons.

5. **Printing the Result:**
   - Finally, the program prints the value of `z`, which represents the total number of screens needed for both types of icons.

### Verification Against Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program against the example test cases:

- **Test Case 1:** `x = 1, y = 1`
  - `z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 1 * 4 = 11`
  - Since `m >= x`, no adjustment is needed. Output: `1`

- **Test Case 2:** `x = 7, y = 2`
  - `z = (2 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 2 * 4 = 7`
  - Since `m >= x`, no adjustment is needed. Output: `1`

- **Test Case 3:** `x = 12, y = 4`
  - `z = (4 + 1) // 2 = 2`
  - `m = 15 * 2 - 4 * 4 = 14`
  - Since `m >= x`, no adjustment is needed. Output: `2`

- **Test Case 4:** `x = 0, y = 3`
  - `z = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2`
  - `m = 15 * 2 - 3 * 4 = 18`
  - Since `m >= x`, no adjustment is needed. Output: `2`

- **Test Case 5:** `x = 1, y = 0`
  - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`
  - Since `m < x`, adjust `z`: `z = 0 + (1 - 0 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`. Output: `1`

- **Test Case 6:** `x = 8, y = 1`
  - `z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 1 * 4 = 11`
  - Since `m >= x`, no adjustment is needed. Output: `1`

- **Test Case 7:** `x = 0, y = 0`
  - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`
  - Since `m >= x`, no adjustment is needed. Output: `0`

- **Test Case 8:** `x = 2, y = 0`
  - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`
  - Since `m < x`, adjust `z`: `z = 0 + (2 - 0 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`. Output: `1`

- **Test Case 9:** `x = 15, y = 0`
  - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`
  - Since `m < x`, adjust `z`: `z = 0 + (15 - 0 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 2`. Output: `1`

- **Test Case 10:** `x = 8, y = 2`
  - `z = (2 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 2 * 4 = 7`
  - Since `m >= x`, no adjustment is needed. Output: `2`

- **Test Case 11:** `x = 0, y = 9`
  - `z = (9 + 1) // 2 = 5`
  - `m = 15 * 5 - 9 * 4 = 21`
  - Since `m >= x`, no adjustment is needed. Output: `5`

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly compute the minimum number of screens needed for each test case based on the provided logic and verification against the example test cases.
