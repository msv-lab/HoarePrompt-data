Given the initial state, the code calculates the value of `m` using the formula `m = 15 * z - y * 4`. Since `z` is defined as `(y + 1) // 2`, we substitute this into the equation for `m`.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`, which means `z` is the integer division of `y + 1` by 2.
- `m` is then calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`.

Since `x` is not used in the calculation of `m`, its value remains unchanged. The values of `t` and `a` also remain unchanged as they are not involved in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`.**
