The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. This means the previous values of `x` and `y` are overwritten by the new values read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input, `i` is 4.**
