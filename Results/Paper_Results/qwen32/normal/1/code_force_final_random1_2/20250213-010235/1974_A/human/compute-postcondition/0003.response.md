The value of `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`. Given that `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, the value of `z` will be an integer between 0 and 50. The values of `t`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`.**
