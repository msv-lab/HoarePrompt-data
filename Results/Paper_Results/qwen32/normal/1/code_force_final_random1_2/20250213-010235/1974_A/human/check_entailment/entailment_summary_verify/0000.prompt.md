You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (both between 0 and 99 inclusive), performs a series of calculations, and prints an integer `z` derived from these inputs.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a grid of size 5x3 (15 cells).
- We need to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on these grids.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)
```

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons (`z` calculation):**
   - `z = (y + 1) // 2`: This formula does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for `y` 2x2 icons.
     - For example, if `y = 1`, `z` becomes `1`, which is correct.
     - But if `y = 2`, `z` becomes `1`, which is incorrect because 2 2x2 icons require 2 screens.
     - The correct formula should be `z = (y + 1) // 2` but this needs to be re-evaluated in context.
   
2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Space (`m` calculation):**
   - `m = 15 * z - y * 4`: This formula calculates the remaining space after placing `y` 2x2 icons.
     - However, it does not correctly account for the fact that placing 2x2 icons may leave irregular spaces that cannot be filled by 1x1 icons.
   
3. **Incorrect Adjustment for 1x1 Icons (`if m < a` condition):**
   - `if m < a:` This condition is incorrect and does not properly handle the placement of 1x1 icons.
     - The variable `a` represents the number of test cases, not the remaining space.
     - The condition should check if there is enough space for 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons.

### Correct Approach:
1. Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons.
2. Calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons.
3. Place 1x1 icons in the remaining space.
4. If there is not enough space, add additional screens.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

#### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons and does not properly handle the placement of 1x1 icons in the remaining space. As a result, it fails to provide the correct minimum number of screens for various inputs.
