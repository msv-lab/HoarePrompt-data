Postcondition: **`p` is equal to `j`; the first element of `s` is the original first element, and the element at index `k-1` is the original element at index `k-1`; `s` has at least one element; `i` is the next element in `s` after the previous `i`. If `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i` is not greater than `h` and `z` equals 1, `ans1` is incremented by 1.**
