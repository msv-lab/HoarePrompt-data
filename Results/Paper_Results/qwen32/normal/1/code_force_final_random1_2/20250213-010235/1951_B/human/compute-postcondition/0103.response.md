The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `s`, `i`, or `h`. It only affects the control flow by exiting the nearest enclosing loop or switch-like construct (in languages that support such constructs). Since there is no loop or switch-like construct shown in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`s` must have at least one element, `i` is not equal to `h`, and `i` is greater than `h`.**
