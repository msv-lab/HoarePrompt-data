Output State: **`p` is equal to `j`, the first element of `s` is the original first element, and the element at index `k-1` is the original element at index `k-1`, `s` has at least one element, `i` is the next element in `s` after the current `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `p`, `s`, `j`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `break` statement is to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
