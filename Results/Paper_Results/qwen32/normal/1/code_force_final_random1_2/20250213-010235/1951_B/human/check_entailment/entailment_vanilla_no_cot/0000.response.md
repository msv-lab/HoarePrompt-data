Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Global Variable `n`**: The variable `n` is used inside the function `func_1`, but it is not defined within the scope of this function. This will cause a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Maximum Wins**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve. However, the logic inside the function is flawed.
   - The function incorrectly assumes that the maximum wins can be determined by finding the first two elements greater than the cow `k`'s rating and making decisions based on their positions. This approach does not account for all possible scenarios where swapping might help increase the number of wins.
   - The function also incorrectly handles edge cases, such as when the cow `k` is already at the best possible position or when there are no elements greater than cow `k`'s rating.

3. **Hardcoded Debugging Statement**: There is a hardcoded debugging statement `if k == 14: print(ind)` which should be removed or properly handled.

4. **Incorrect Return Values**:
   - The function returns incorrect values in several conditions. For example, `return n - 1` is incorrect because cow `k` cannot win all matches unless it is the strongest cow.
   - The conditions for returning `max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)` and other similar expressions are not correctly derived from the problem requirements.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be rewritten with a correct algorithm that considers all possible swaps and calculates the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve. A more systematic approach would involve simulating the tournament with and without a swap and comparing the results.
