Postcondition: **`s` must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in `s`. If the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1 and `z` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `z` equals 1, `ans1` is incremented by 1.**
