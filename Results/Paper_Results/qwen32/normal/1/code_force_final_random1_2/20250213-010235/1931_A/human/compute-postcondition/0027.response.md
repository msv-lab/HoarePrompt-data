The code concatenates the string `'a'` with the character at index `n - 28` of the `alphabet` string, and then appends `'z'` to the result. This concatenated string is then added to the `word` variable.

Given that `alphabet` contains all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', the character at index `n - 28` can be determined by the value of `n`. Since `n` is an input integer, we'll express the character in terms of `n`.

The new value of `word` will be `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. The values of `t`, `n`, `alphabet`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is 4, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.**
