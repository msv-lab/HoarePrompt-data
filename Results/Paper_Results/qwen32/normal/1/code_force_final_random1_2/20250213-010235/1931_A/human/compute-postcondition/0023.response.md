The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the input integer `n` (which determines the number of iterations).

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than the input integer `n`.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, we need to set `i` to its new value, which is the old value of `i` plus 1.

Therefore, if `i` was 3 at the end of the last iteration, it should be 4 at the start of the next iteration. The values of `t`, `n`, `alphabet`, and `word` do not change based on the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is 4**
