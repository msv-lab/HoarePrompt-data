Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is an input integer
- `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'
- `word` is ''
- `i` is incremented by 1

Code Snippet:
```python
word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
```

Impact of the Code:
- The variable `word` is updated by concatenating the current value of `word` (which is initially an empty string) with the string `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
- The value of `t`, `n`, `alphabet`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Given that `alphabet` contains all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `alphabet[n - 28]` will access the character at index `n - 28`. Since `alphabet` is zero-indexed, `n - 28` should be a valid index between 0 and 25 (inclusive) for `alphabet`.

Thus, the new value of `word` will be `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
