To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the construction of the `word` variable based on the given conditions:

1. **Initial State Recap:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100 (though `t` is not used in the `word` construction).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
   - `i` is 4 (though `i` is not used in the `word` construction).
   - `word` is constructed based on the value of `n`.

2. **Conditions for Constructing `word`:**
   - If `n` > 52, `word` is the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'.
   - If `n` is greater than 26 but less than or equal to 52, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - Otherwise, if `n` is less than or equal to 26, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]'`.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we need to consider the three possible cases for constructing `word` based on the value of `n`.

Let's break down each case:

- **Case 1: n > 52**
  - `word` = `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`
  - For example, if `n` is 53, then `word` = `alphabet[0] + 'zz'` = 'a' + 'zz' = 'azz'
  - If `n` is 54, then `word` = `alphabet[1] + 'zz'` = 'b' + 'zz' = 'bzz'
  - And so on...

- **Case 2: 26 < n <= 52**
  - `word` = `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`
  - For example, if `n` is 27, then `word` = `'a' + alphabet[-1] + 'z'` = `'a' + 'z' + 'z'` = 'azz'
  - If `n` is 28, then `word` = `'a' + alphabet[0] + 'z'` = `'a' + 'a' + 'z'` = 'aaz'
  - If `n` is 29, then `word` = `'a' + alphabet[1] + 'z'` = `'a' + 'b' + 'z'` = 'abz'
  - And so on...

- **Case 3: n <= 26**
  - `word` = `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`
  - For example, if `n` is 1, then `word` = `'aa' + alphabet[-2]` = `'aa' + 'y'` = 'aay'
  - If `n` is 2, then `word` = `'aa' + alphabet[-1]` = `'aa' + 'z'` = 'aaz'
  - If `n` is 3, then `word` = `'aa' + alphabet[0]` = `'aa' + 'a'` = 'aaa'
  - If `n` is 4, then `word` = `'aa' + alphabet[1]` = `'aa' + 'b'` = 'aab'
  - And so on...

Given that the exact value of `n` is not specified, the output will depend on the value of `n`. Therefore, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **word (where word is constructed based on the value of n: if n > 52, word is alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'; if 26 < n <= 52, word is 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'; if n <= 26, word is 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3])**
