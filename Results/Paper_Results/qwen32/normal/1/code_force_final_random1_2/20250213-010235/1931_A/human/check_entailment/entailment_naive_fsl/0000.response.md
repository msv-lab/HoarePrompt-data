Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to decode an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78) back into the lexicographically smallest possible 3-letter word.
- Each letter in the word corresponds to a position in the alphabet (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).
- The integer `n` is the sum of these positions.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program attempts to decode the integer `n` into a 3-letter word using the following logic:
- If `n > 52`, it constructs the word by taking the letter corresponding to `n - 53` and appending "zz".
- If `n > 26`, it constructs the word by taking "a" and the letter corresponding to `n - 28` and appending "z".
- Otherwise, it constructs the word by taking "aa" and the letter corresponding to `n - 3`.

### Potential Issues:
Let's check if the logic covers all possible values of `n` correctly:

1. **Case: `n = 3`**
   - Expected word: "aaa"
   - Program output: "aa" + alphabet[0] = "aaa"
   - This works correctly.

2. **Case: `n = 26`**
   - Expected word: "azz"
   - Program output: "aa" + alphabet[23] = "aaz"
   - This is incorrect. It should be "azz".

3. **Case: `n = 27`**
   - Expected word: "baa"
   - Program output: "a" + alphabet[-1] + "z" = "azz"
   - This is incorrect. It should be "baa".

4. **Case: `n = 52`**
   - Expected word: "zzz"
   - Program output: "aa" + alphabet[49] = "aad"
   - This is incorrect. It should be "zzz".

5. **Case: `n = 53`**
   - Expected word: "zza"
   - Program output: alphabet[0] + "zz" = "azz"
   - This is incorrect. It should be "zza".

6. **Case: `n = 78`**
   - Expected word: "zzz"
   - Program output: alphabet[25] + "zz" = "zzz"
   - This works correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly when `n` is close to the boundaries (e.g., 26, 27, 52, 53). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program fails to produce the lexicographically smallest word for several values of `n` due to incorrect indexing and logic. Specifically, it mishandles cases where `n` is near the boundaries of the ranges defined in the conditional statements.
