Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. If `n` is greater than 26 but less than or equal to 52, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 27] + 'z'`. If `n` is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 26, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to whatever integer is provided by the user input. The values of `t`, `alphabet`, and `word` (which depends on the new value of `n`) remain as per their definitions. The variable `i` is incremented by 1.
