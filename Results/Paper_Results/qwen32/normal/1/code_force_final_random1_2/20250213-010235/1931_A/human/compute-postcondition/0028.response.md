The code snippet appends the string `'aa'` concatenated with the character at index `n - 3` of the `alphabet` string to the `word` variable. Given that `alphabet` contains all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', the character at index `n - 3` will be the `n-2`th letter of the alphabet.

Since `word` was initially an empty string, after executing the code, `word` will be `'aa'` followed by the `n-2`th letter of the alphabet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `i` is 4, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]'`.**
