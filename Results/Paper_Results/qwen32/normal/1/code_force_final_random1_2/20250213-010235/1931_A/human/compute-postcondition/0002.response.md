The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new value to `n` based on the user input, which must be greater than 0 according to the problem statement. The values of `t` and `alphabet` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer greater than 0, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.**
