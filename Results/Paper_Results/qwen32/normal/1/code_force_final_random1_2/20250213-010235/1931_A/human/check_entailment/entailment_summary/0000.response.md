### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n`, where `n` is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The smallest possible word should start with the earliest possible letters in the alphabet.
2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the positions of the letters should equal `n`.

The provided code attempts to generate such a word based on the value of `n`:
- If `n > 52`, it constructs a word starting with a letter derived from `n - 53` followed by 'zz'.
- If `n > 26`, it constructs a word starting with 'a', followed by a letter derived from `n - 28`, and ending with 'z'.
- Otherwise, it constructs a word starting with 'aa' followed by a letter derived from `n - 3`.

Let's verify these conditions:
- **Case 1 (`n > 52`)**: This condition is intended to handle cases where the sum `n` is large enough to allow the first letter to be beyond 'z'. However, since the maximum possible sum of three letters is `26 + 26 + 26 = 78`, the condition `n > 52` is not entirely accurate. The correct approach would be to distribute the sum among the three letters in a way that maintains lexicographical order.
- **Case 2 (`n > 26`)**: This condition handles cases where the sum is large enough to allow the second letter to be beyond 'z'. Again, this is not the optimal way to ensure the smallest lexicographical order.
- **Case 3 (`n <= 26`)**: This condition is intended for small sums where the word must start with 'aa' and the third letter is derived from `n - 3`. This part seems correct for very small sums, but it does not generalize well for larger sums.

The provided code does not correctly handle all possible values of `n` in a way that guarantees the lexicographically smallest word. For example, for `n = 24`, the correct output should be "aav", but the code might produce a different result due to its logic.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly generate the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `n` within the given constraints.

**Correctness: False**
