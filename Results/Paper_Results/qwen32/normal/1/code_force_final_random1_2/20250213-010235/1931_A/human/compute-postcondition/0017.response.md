To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is an input integer
- `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'
- `word` is ''
- `i` is incremented by 1

Code Snippet:
```python
word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
```

The code appends to `word` a substring from `alphabet` starting at index `n - 53` plus the string `'zz'`. 

Given that `alphabet` contains all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', the valid range for `n - 53` should be between 0 and 25 (inclusive) to access a valid character in `alphabet`.

Let's assume `n` is within a valid range such that `0 <= n - 53 <= 25`. This implies `53 <= n <= 78`.

After executing the code, `word` will be updated to `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. The values of `t`, `n`, `alphabet`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100, `n` retains its input value, `alphabet` stays as a string of all lowercase letters, `word` becomes the character at position `n - 53` in `alphabet` followed by `'zz'`, and `i` is incremented by 1.
