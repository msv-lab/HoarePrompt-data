The code snippet provided imports the lowercase alphabet from the `string` module and assigns it to the variable `alphabet`. This operation does not affect the variables `t` and `n`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.**
