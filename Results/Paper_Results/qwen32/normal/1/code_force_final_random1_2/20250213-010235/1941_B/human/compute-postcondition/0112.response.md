The code snippet `a[i] -= opNum` modifies the value of `a[i]` by subtracting `opNum` from it. Given the initial state, `i` is 4, so `a[4]` is being updated. `opNum` is defined as `a[4]`, so effectively, `a[4]` is being reduced by its own value, resulting in `a[4]` becoming 0.

Here's the updated state:
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `numTest` is at least 1.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is now 0 (previously `opNum`), `a[i+1]` is 0, and `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged.
- `opNum` is `a[4]` (which was the original value before the operation, now 0).
- `stop` is True if `a[i]` is less than 0, otherwise `stop` remains False. Since `a[4]` is now 0, `stop` remains False.
- `i` is 4.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `numTest` is at least 1; `n` is greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers where `a[4]` is 0, `a[5]` is 0, and `a[6]` remains unchanged; `opNum` is 0; `stop` is False; `i` is 4.**
