The code snippet `a[i] -= opNum` modifies the element at index `i` in the list `a` by subtracting `opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is defined as `a[i]`, the operation effectively sets `a[i]` to `a[i] - a[i]`, which results in `a[i]` being 0.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `numTest` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` now equal to 0, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `stop` remains False unless `a[i]` is less than 0, `i` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the element at index `i` in the list `a` is now 0, while all other variables retain their original values.
