To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(0, n - 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the description of the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `numTest` is decreased by 1.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `a[i]` is 0.
- `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged.
- `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged.
- `opNum` is 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `stop` remains False.

We need to adjust the state for the start of the next iteration based on the loop head variables `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n - 3` (since `range(0, n - 2)` means `i` will take values from `0` to `n - 3` inclusive).
2. **Current State of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was `k` at the start of the previous iteration, it became `k + 1` at the end.
3. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 2`. Since `i` was `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 2`.

### Adjusting the State:
- **`i`**: Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to be incremented by 1 again to reflect the start of the next iteration. Thus, if `i` was `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `k + 2` at the start of the next iteration.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

### Final State:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `numTest` is decreased by 1.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `a[i]` is 0.
- `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged.
- `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged.
- `opNum` is 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1 again (from `k + 1` to `k + 2`).
- `stop` remains False.

Since the problem specifies that we only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`i` and `n`), the final adjusted state is:

State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a[i]` is 0, `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged, `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged, `opNum` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `stop` remains False**.

However, focusing only on the loop head variables:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 2**.

Given the specific nature of the problem, we should express `i` explicitly:
State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a[i]` is 0, `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged, `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged, `opNum` is 0, `i` is now `i + 1`, `stop` remains False**.

For clarity in the context of the loop head:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 2**. 

Since `i` was `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `k + 2` at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 2**.

Thus, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 2**. 

Expressing `i` explicitly:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 2**.

So the final state considering only the loop head variables is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 2**.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 2**.

Expressing `i` explicitly:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 2**.
