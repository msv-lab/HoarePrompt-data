Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks specific conditions related to the parity and consecutive differences of the first and last elements of the list `a`. It prints "YES" if the conditions are met, otherwise it prints "NO".**
