The given code modifies the value of `a[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `opNum` from it. Since `opNum` is equal to the original value of `a[i]`, and `a[i]` is currently 0, `opNum` is also 0. Therefore, `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged.

Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` now equal to 0 and `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged, `stop` remains False, `opNum` is equal to 0.**
