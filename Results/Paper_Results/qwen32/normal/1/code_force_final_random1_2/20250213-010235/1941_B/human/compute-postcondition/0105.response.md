The code snippet `a[i + 2] -= opNum` modifies the element at index `i + 2` in the list `a` by subtracting the value of `opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is 0, the value at `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `numTest` is at least 1; `n` is greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is 0, `a[i+1]` is 0, and `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged; `opNum` is 0; `stop` remains False; `i` is incremented by 1.**
