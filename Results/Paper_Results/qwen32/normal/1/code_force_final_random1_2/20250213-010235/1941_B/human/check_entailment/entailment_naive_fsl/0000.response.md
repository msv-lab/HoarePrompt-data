Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation. The current implementation only checks if the first and last elements satisfy certain conditions, which is insufficient to solve the problem.

Let's analyze the logic of the given program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

The program checks:
1. If the first element `b[0]` is odd and the second element `b[1]` is not equal to `b[0] + 2`, it prints 'NO'.
2. If the last element `b[-1]` is odd and the second last element `b[-2]` is not equal to `b[-1] + 2`, it prints 'NO'.
3. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

However, these checks do not cover all necessary conditions for making all elements of the array zero. The operation can be applied multiple times to different indices, and the conditions for making all elements zero are more complex than just checking the first and last elements.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the entire array can be reduced to zeros using the allowed operations. One key observation is that the sum of the array elements must be divisible by 4 because each operation reduces the sum by 4. Additionally, we need to ensure that the elements can be balanced out through the operations.

Here is a counterexample where the given program fails:

**Counterexample:**
```
1
5
2 3 4 3 2
```

For this input, the program would print 'YES' because neither the first nor the last element violates the simple checks. However, it is impossible to make all elements zero using the described operations. The sum of the array is 14, which is not divisible by 4, so it is impossible to reduce the array to zeros.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
