The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or `stop`. It only terminates the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `stop` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 2, `stop` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
