Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is decreased by 1, `n` remains the same, `a[i]` is 0 for all i from 0 to n - 3, `a[n - 2]` and `a[n - 1]` remain unchanged. If either `a[n - 1]` or `a[n - 2]` is not 0, then the condition `a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0` holds true. If both `a[n - 2]` and `a[n - 1]` are 0, then the condition `a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0` does not hold true. If `stop` is True, `stop` remains True. If `stop` is False, `stop` remains False.**
