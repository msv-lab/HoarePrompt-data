The value of `opNum` is updated to the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 4, `opNum` is now equal to `a[4]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `numTest` is at least 1; `n` is greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is 0, `a[i+1]` is 0, and `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged; `opNum` is `a[4]`; `stop` is True if `a[i]` is less than 0, otherwise `stop` remains False; `i` is 4.**
