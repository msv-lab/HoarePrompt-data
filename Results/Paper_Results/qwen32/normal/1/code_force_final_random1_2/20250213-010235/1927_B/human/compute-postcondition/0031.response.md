The provided code snippet does not modify any of the variables `ans`, `i`, or `array`. Instead, it introduces a new variable `alp`, which is a list of the English alphabet characters. Since none of the existing variables are altered, and no operations are performed that would affect their values, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing `l` elements, each being `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for `j` from `0` to `l-1`; `i` is incremented by 1; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `alp` is a list of the English alphabet characters.**
