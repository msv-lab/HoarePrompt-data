To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
```

Here's what happens:
- `rev_array[j:]` creates a sublist starting from index `j` to the end of `rev_array`.
- `.count(rev_array[j])` counts the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist `rev_array[j:]`.
- `alp[... - 1]` uses the count minus one as an index to access an element from the list `alp`.
- `ans.append(...)` adds the accessed element from `alp` to the list `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `l` must be greater than 0.
- `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `alp` is a predefined list of lowercase English letters.
- `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`.

The variable `j` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it is a valid index into `rev_array`. Let's denote the value of `rev_array[j]` as `val`. The count of `val` in `rev_array[j:]` will be at least 1 since `val` is included in the sublist starting from `j`.

Let's denote the count of `val` in `rev_array[j:]` as `cnt`. Therefore, `alp[cnt - 1]` accesses the element at index `cnt - 1` in `alp`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` now contains one additional element, which is `alp[cnt - 1]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `l`, `array`, `alp`, `rev_array`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing one additional element `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `l` must be greater than 0; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']; `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`.**
