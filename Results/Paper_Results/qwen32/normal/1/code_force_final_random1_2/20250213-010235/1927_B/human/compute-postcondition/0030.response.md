The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a new list called `array`. This operation does not affect the existing variables `ans`, `l`, `alp`, `rev_array`, or `i`.

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing `l` elements, each being `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for `j` from `0` to `l-1`; `i` is incremented by 1; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
