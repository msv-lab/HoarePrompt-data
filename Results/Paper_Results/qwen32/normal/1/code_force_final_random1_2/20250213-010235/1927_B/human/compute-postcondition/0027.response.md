To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `ans` is a list containing `l` elements.
- Each element in `ans` is derived from the expression `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for `j` ranging from `0` to `l-1`.

### Variables and Expressions:
- `alp`: This is presumably a list or array of characters or strings.
- `rev_array`: This is another list or array of elements.
- `rev_array[j:]`: This represents a slice of `rev_array` starting from index `j` to the end of the list.
- `rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j])`: This counts how many times the element at index `j` in `rev_array` appears in the slice `rev_array[j:]`.
- `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`: This uses the count obtained above as an index to access an element in `alp`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(map(str, ans)))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Mapping Elements**: The `map(str, ans)` function converts each element in the list `ans` to a string.
2. **Joining Strings**: The `''.join(...)` function concatenates all these string representations into a single string.
3. **Printing**: The resulting concatenated string is then printed.

### Determining the Output:
Given the initial state, the exact content of `ans` depends on the values in `alp` and `rev_array`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables:

- For each index `j` from `0` to `l-1`, `ans[j]` is determined by the count of `rev_array[j]` in the slice `rev_array[j:]`, minus one, used as an index to access `alp`.
- The final output is a string formed by joining all elements of `ans` after converting them to strings.

### Final Output Description:
The output will be a string formed by concatenating the string representations of each element in the list `ans`, where each element of `ans` is derived from the count of elements in `rev_array` as described.

Output: **a string formed by concatenating the string representations of each element in the list `ans`, where each element of `ans` is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for `j` from `0` to `l-1`**
