The given code snippet reverses the list `array` and assigns it to `rev_array`. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, `array`, and `alp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing `l` elements, each being `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for `j` from `0` to `l-1`; `i` is incremented by 1; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `alp` is a list of the English alphabet characters; `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.**
