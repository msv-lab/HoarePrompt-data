The given Python code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts those components to integers, and stores them in a new list called `array`. This operation does not affect the existing variables `ans`, `i`, or `l`.

Output State: **`ans` is a list of `l` characters, where each character is determined by the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` minus one, mapped to a character in `alp`; `i` is incremented by 1; `l` is an input integer; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
