To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and accumulates results. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Loop Structure**: The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Inner Loop**: For each test case, the inner loop constructs a string `ans` based on the reversed array `rev_array`.
3. **Character Construction**: Each character in `ans` is derived from the count of the current element in the remaining part of `rev_array`, decremented by one, and then mapped to a character in the alphabet list `alp`.

Since the problem specifies that the output states after the first three iterations are consistent with the logic described, we can infer that the same process will be applied to all `t` test cases.

### Output State Explanation
After all `t` iterations, the program will have processed each test case independently, constructing a string `ans` for each one. The final output state will consist of `t` strings, each corresponding to the result of processing one test case.

### Final Output State
The final output state will be a series of `t` lines, where each line is the constructed string `ans` for each respective test case.

### Format of the Output State
Given the requirement to strictly follow the format, the final output state will be:

Output State: **Each line corresponds to the constructed string `ans` for each test case.**

In natural language, this means that the output will be a sequence of `t` lines, where each line is a string of characters derived from the specified counting and mapping process for each test case.
