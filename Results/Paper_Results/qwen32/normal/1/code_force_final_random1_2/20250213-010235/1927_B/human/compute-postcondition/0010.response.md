The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `l`. If `j` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Given that `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, if `j` was `x` at the start of the previous iteration, it would be `x + 1` now. For the loop to execute again, `j` must still be less than `l`.

So, if `j` is currently `x + 1`, then for the next iteration, `j` should be `x + 2`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `l` must be greater than or equal to 1, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing one more character than before, specifically the character from `alp` corresponding to the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` minus one, `j` is incremented by 1**

Since `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increment it by 1 again for the next iteration:
