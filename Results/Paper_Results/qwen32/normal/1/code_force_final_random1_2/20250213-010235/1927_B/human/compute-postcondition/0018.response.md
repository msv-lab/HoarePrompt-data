Output State: **`ans` is a list of `l` characters, where each character is determined by the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` minus one, mapped to a character in `alp`; `i` is incremented by 1; `l` is an input integer; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `alp` is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']; `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `ans` remains unchanged as a list of `l` characters derived from the reversed array `rev_array`; `i` has been incremented by 1; `l` remains the same input integer; `array` remains the same list of integers obtained from the input; `alp` remains the same list of alphabet characters; `rev_array` is now the reverse of `array`.
