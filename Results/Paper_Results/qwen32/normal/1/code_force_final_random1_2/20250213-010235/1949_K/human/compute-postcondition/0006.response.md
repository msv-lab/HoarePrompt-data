To determine the output state, let's assume the function `distribute_number(num)` distributes the number `num` to one of the groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, or `group_c`) based on some criteria. Since the exact implementation of `distribute_number(num)` is not provided, we'll consider a typical scenario where the number is added to the group with the smallest sum.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`.
- `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.
- `group_a` contains the first element of `numbers`.
- `group_b` and `group_c` are empty lists.
- `sum_a` is equal to the first element of `numbers`.
- `sum_b` and `sum_c` are 0.
- `num` is the second element of `numbers`.

Let's assume `distribute_number(num)` adds `num` to the group with the smallest sum. Initially, `sum_a` is the only non-zero sum, and `sum_b` and `sum_c` are both 0. Therefore, `num` will be added to either `group_b` or `group_c`. For simplicity, let's assume it gets added to `group_b`.

After executing `distribute_number(num)`, the state changes as follows:
- `group_b` now contains `num`.
- `sum_b` is now equal to `num`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `group_a` contains the first element of `numbers`, `group_b` contains the second element of `numbers`, `group_c` is an empty list, `sum_a` is equal to the first element of `numbers`, `sum_b` is equal to the second element of `numbers`, `sum_c` is 0, `num` is the second element of `numbers`.**
