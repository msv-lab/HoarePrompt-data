The provided Python code initializes three empty lists named `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. No calculations or assignments are performed on the existing variables `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, or `numbers`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the total number of integers, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers representing the sizes of the three groups such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order; `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists.**
