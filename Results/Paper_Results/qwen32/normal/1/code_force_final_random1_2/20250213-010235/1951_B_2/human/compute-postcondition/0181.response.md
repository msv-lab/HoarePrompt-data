Postcondition: **`ans1` is either 1 or 2 if `z` is 1; otherwise, `ans1` remains 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h` and `i` equals `h`; otherwise, `ans1` remains 0. `z` is 1 if `i` equals `h`; otherwise, `z` is 0. `i` is the next element in the sequence `s` after the current `i`. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `ans`, `p`) retain their initial values.**
