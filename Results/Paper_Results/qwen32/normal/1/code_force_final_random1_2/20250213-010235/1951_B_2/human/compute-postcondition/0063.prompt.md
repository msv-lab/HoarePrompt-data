Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p` is equal to `j`; the first element of `s` is the original first element, and the element at index `k-1` is the original element at index `k-1`; `ans1` is 0; `z` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `p` is equal to `j`; the first element of `s` is the original first element, and the element at index `k-1` is the original element at index `k-1`; `s` must have at least one element; if `i` equals `h`, `ans1` is 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 0; if `i` does not equal `h`, `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` remains 0; `z` is 1 if `i` equals `h`, otherwise `z` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `p` is equal to `j`; the first element of `s` is the original first element, and the element at index `k-1` is the original element at index `k-1`; `s` has at least one element; `i` is the next element in `s` after the previous `i`. If `i` is equal to `h`, no further changes are made to `ans1` or `z`. If `i` is not equal to `h` and the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1 and `z` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i` is not greater than `h` and `z` equals 1, `ans1` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p` is equal to `j`, the first element of `s` is the original first element, and the element at index `k-1` is the original element at index `k-1`. `s` has at least one element, and `i` is the next element in `s` after the current `i`. If `i` is equal to `h`, no changes are made to `ans1` or `z`. If `i` is not equal to `h`, and `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1 and `z` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i` is not equal to `h`, `i` is not greater than `h`, and `z` equals 1, `ans1` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
