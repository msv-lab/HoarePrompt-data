Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans1` is 0; `z` is 0; `j` is `len(s) - 2`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `s` is a list of integers from the input with the first element swapped with the element at index `k-1` and then the elements at indices `len(s) - 2` and `k-1` are swapped; `h` is the first element of `s`; `ans` is `len(s) - 1`; `p` is `len(s) - 2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans1` is 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h` and `i` equals `h`; otherwise, `ans1` remains 0. `z` is 1 if `i` equals `h`; otherwise, `z` is 0. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `ans`, `p`, `i`) retain their initial values as described in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans1` is `ans1 + 1` if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h` and `i` equals `h`; otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged. If `i` equals `h`, `z` is 1; otherwise, `z` is 0. `i` is the next element in the sequence `s` after the current `i`. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `ans`, `p`) retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans1` is incremented by 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h` and `i` equals `h`. If `i` equals `h`, `z` is set to 1; otherwise, `z` is set to 0. `i` is updated to `next_i`, which is the next element in the sequence `s` after the current `i`. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `ans`, `p`) retain their initial values. Additionally, `ans1` is incremented by 1 if `i` is greater than `h` and `i` equals `h`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
