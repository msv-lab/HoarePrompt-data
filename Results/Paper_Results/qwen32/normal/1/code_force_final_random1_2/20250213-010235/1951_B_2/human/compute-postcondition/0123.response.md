Output State: **`s` must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `s` and `i` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without altering the values of `s` or `i`.
