The `print('NO')` statement in the given Python code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided within the `print` function.

Here's the breakdown:

- The initial state provides details about various variables (`t`, `numTest`, `n`, `a`, `opNum`, `i`, `stop`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
