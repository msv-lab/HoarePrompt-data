The code snippet `a[i + 2] -= opNum` modifies the value of `a[i + 2]` by subtracting `opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is the original value of `a[i]` and `a[i]` is 0, `opNum` is also 0. Therefore, subtracting `opNum` (which is 0) from `a[i + 2]` does not change the value of `a[i + 2]`.

Thus, the only variable that would change if there was a different value for `opNum` remains unaffected here because `opNum` is 0.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numTest` is decreased by 1; `n` is greater than 2; `a[i]` is 0; `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged; `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged; `opNum` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `stop` remains False.**
