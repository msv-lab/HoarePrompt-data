Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` now equal to 0 and `a[i + 1]` remains unchanged, `a[i + 2]` remains unchanged, `opNum` is equal to 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is less than 0, `stop` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains False.**
