The code snippet `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` modifies the element at index `i + 1` in the list `a`. Given that `i` is 4 and `opNum` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a[5] -= 2 * 0`, which means `a[5]` remains unchanged because subtracting 0 from any number does not change its value.

Therefore, the value of `a[5]` stays 0, and no other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `numTest` is at least 1; `n` is greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers where `a[4]` is 0, `a[5]` is 0, and `a[6]` remains unchanged; `opNum` is 0; `stop` is False; `i` is 4.**
