Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an input integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. The first element of `b` is odd and the second element of `b` is not equal to the first element plus 2, or the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element of `b` is not equal to the last element plus 2.**
