To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop modifies the array `a` and the conditions under which it stops.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 3` (inclusive).
- For each iteration `i`, the following operations occur:
  - If `a[i] < 0`, the loop prints 'NO', sets `stop` to True, and breaks out of the loop.
  - Otherwise, it calculates `opNum = a[i]`.
  - It then updates the elements of `a` as follows:
    - `a[i] -= opNum`
    - `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum`
    - `a[i + 2] -= opNum`

### Given Output States:
- After 1 iteration: `a[i]` becomes 0, `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` are unchanged, `opNum` is 0, `stop` is False unless `a[i]` was initially negative.
- After 2 iterations: Similar to the first iteration but with `i` incremented by 1.
- After 3 iterations: Similar to the second iteration but with `i` incremented by 1 again. `stop` can become True if `a[i]` is negative.

### Final Output State:
The loop will continue until either:
1. `i` reaches `n - 2` (i.e., the loop completes all possible iterations).
2. `a[i]` becomes negative during any iteration, causing `stop` to be set to True and the loop to terminate early.

Let's consider both scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Loop Completes All Iterations
- If `a[i]` is never negative throughout all iterations, the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n - 3`.
- Each element `a[i]` will be reduced by `a[i]`, making it 0.
- Elements `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` will be reduced by `2 * a[i]` and `a[i]` respectively.
- `stop` will remain False.

#### Scenario 2: Loop Terminates Early
- If `a[i]` becomes negative at any point, the loop will print 'NO', set `stop` to True, and terminate.
- The state of `a` will reflect the reductions made up to the point of termination.

### Conclusion:
The final output state depends on whether the loop completes all iterations or terminates early due to a negative value in `a[i]`.

**Output State:**
- If the loop completes all iterations (`stop` remains False):
  - `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
  - `numTest` remains greater than 0.
  - `n` remains unchanged.
  - `a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n - 3` becomes 0.
  - `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` are reduced by `2 * a[i]` and `a[i]` respectively.
  - `stop` is False.
  
- If the loop terminates early (`stop` becomes True):
  - `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
  - `numTest` remains greater than 0.
  - `n` remains unchanged.
  - `a` reflects the reductions made up to the point of termination.
  - `stop` is True.

Since the problem does not specify that the loop terminates early, we assume the loop completes all iterations unless stated otherwise.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is greater than 0, `n` is unchanged, `a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `n - 3` is 0, `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` are reduced by `2 * a[i]` and `a[i]` respectively, `stop` is False.**
