In this task, the initial state provides information about the variables `i` and `n`. Specifically:

- `i` is defined as `i + 1`, which means `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` is stated to be greater than 2.

However, these details about `i` and `n` do not affect the execution of the `print` statement because the statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The value of `i` being `i + 1` does not influence the print statement since `i` is not used within the print statement.
2. Similarly, the fact that `n` is greater than 2 also does not impact the print statement as `n` is not referenced in it.

Given this, the print statement will simply output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
