The code `a[i] -= opNum` modifies the value of `a[i]` by subtracting `opNum` from it. Given that `opNum` is defined as `a[i]`, the operation effectively sets `a[i]` to `a[i] - a[i]`, which results in `a[i]` being `0`.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `stop`) remain unchanged unless the condition for `stop` changes due to the modification of `a[i]`. However, since the problem statement does not specify any further conditions that would alter `stop` based on the new value of `a[i]`, we assume `stop` remains as it was.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 2, `stop` is `True` if `a[i]` is less than 0, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains unchanged, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `0`.**
