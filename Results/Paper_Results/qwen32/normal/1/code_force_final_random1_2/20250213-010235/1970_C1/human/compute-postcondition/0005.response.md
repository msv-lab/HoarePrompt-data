The code snippet `lst[a].append(b)` modifies the `lst` dictionary by appending the integer `b` to the list associated with the key `a`. 

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `lst`. The values of `n`, `t`, `x`, `y`, `rev`, and the tree structure remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the starting node for each round, `x` is at least 2, `y` is an integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `lst[a]` now includes `b`, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
