The code `tmp = lst[tmp].pop()` removes the last element from the list `lst[tmp]` and assigns it to the variable `tmp`. This means that the list `lst[tmp]` now has one less element than it did before the operation, and `tmp` now holds the value of the element that was popped.

Given the initial state:
- `tmp` is the value of the last element that was in `lst[tmp]` before the pop operation.
- `lst[tmp]` has one less element than it did before the operation and is not empty.
- `lst[z]` has one less element than it did before the operation.
- `one` is the opposite of its previous boolean value.

After executing the code:
- `tmp` is updated to hold the value of the last element that was in `lst[tmp]` before the pop operation.
- `lst[tmp]` has one less element than it did before the operation and remains non-empty.
- `lst[z]` is unchanged, so it still has one less element than it did before the operation.
- `one` is the opposite of its previous boolean value.

Output State: **`tmp` is the value of the last element that was in `lst[tmp]` before the pop operation; `lst[tmp]` has one less element than it did before the operation and is not empty; `lst[z]` has one less element than it did before the operation; `one` is the opposite of its previous boolean value.**
