Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the starting node for each round, `x` is an integer read from the input, `y` is an integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `lst[a]` now includes all `b` values corresponding to the edges read during the loop, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `rev[b]` now includes all `a` values corresponding to the edges read during the loop, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `z` is an integer read from the input.`**

Explanation: The variable `z` is assigned the value of an integer read from the input. All other variables retain their initial values and states as described.
