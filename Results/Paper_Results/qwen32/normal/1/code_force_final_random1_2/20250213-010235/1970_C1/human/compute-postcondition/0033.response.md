The code snippet `tmp = rev[tmp].pop()` modifies the value of `tmp` by assigning it the last element of the list `rev[tmp]`, and then removes that element from the list.

Given the initial state:
- `tmp` is `z`
- `lst[tmp]` is an empty list (this does not affect the current operation)
- `two` is `False`
- `rev[z]` is not an empty list

After executing the code:
- `tmp` is now the last element of `rev[z]`
- The last element is removed from `rev[z]`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`tmp` is the last element of `rev[z]` before it was popped; `rev[z]` is now missing its last element; `two` is `False`**.
