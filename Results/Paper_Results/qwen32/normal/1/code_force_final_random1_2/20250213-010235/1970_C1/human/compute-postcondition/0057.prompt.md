Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, where 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree with n nodes and n-1 edges, and it is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves; `queue` is a deque containing one element, which is the tuple `(start, 0)`; `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, where 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; tree is an adjacency list representation of the tree with n nodes and n-1 edges, and it is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves; queue is a deque and is now empty; visited is a set containing all nodes in the tree; current is the last node processed by the loop; dist is the distance from start to current.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The `queue` is empty, the `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree, and if the `target` node was found, the function would have returned the distance to the `target` node. If the loop completes without returning, the `current` and `dist` variables reflect the last node processed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `queue` is empty, `visited` contains all reachable nodes, `current` holds the last processed node, and `dist` holds the distance to the last processed node.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
