The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `x`, `y`, `lst`, or `rev` directly. However, it does update the values of `a` and `b` based on the input.

Given the initial state, the only changes are the assignments to `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are now the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the starting node for each round, `x` is at least 1, `y` is an integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `lst[a]` now includes `b`, `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `rev[b]` now includes `a` and any previous elements it had, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input**.

In natural language, the output state remains the same except that `a` and `b` are now assigned the values read from the input. All other variables retain their initial values.
