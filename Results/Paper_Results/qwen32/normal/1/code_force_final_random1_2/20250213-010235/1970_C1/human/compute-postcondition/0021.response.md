The code snippet provided is:

```python
tmp = lst[tmp].pop()
```

This line of code modifies the variable `tmp` by assigning it the value of the last element removed from the list `lst[tmp]`. The list `lst[tmp]` is assumed to contain at least one element, as per the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `tmp` is initially set to `z`.
- `lst` is a `defaultdict` with lists as the default factory, and `lst[z]` contains at least one element.

After executing the code:
- `tmp` will be updated to the value of the last element in `lst[z]`.
- The last element will be removed from `lst[z]`.

Therefore, the output state will be:
- `tmp` is now the value of the last element that was in `lst[z]`.
- `lst[z]` has one less element than it did before the operation.

Output State: **`tmp` is the value of the last element that was in `lst[z]`; `lst[z]` has one less element than it did before the operation.**
