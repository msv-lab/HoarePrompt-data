To determine the output state, we need to understand how the function `func_3` modifies the list `l`. However, the definition of `func_3` is not provided in the problem statement. Since the exact behavior of `func_3` is unknown, we cannot precisely determine the new state of `l` after executing `l = func_3(c, l)`. 

However, we can still describe the state of the other variables that remain unchanged and indicate that `l` has been modified by `func_3`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is not equal to 0
- `l` is a list modified by `func_3(2, l)` twice
- `c` is 3
- `i` is 1

After executing `l = func_3(c, l)`, the list `l` will be further modified by `func_3` with `c` being 3. The values of `n`, `k`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is not equal to 0; `l` is a list modified by `func_3(2, l)` twice and then by `func_3(3, l)` once; `c` is 3; `i` is 1.**
