To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \). The Manhattan value is defined as:
\[ \text{Manhattan value} = |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \]

### Key Points

1. **Permutation**: A permutation of length \( n \) is an array consisting of \( n \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \).
2. **Manhattan Value Calculation**: The Manhattan value is the sum of absolute differences between each element in the permutation and its position.
3. **Constraints**: 
   - \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \) (number of test cases)
   - \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \)
   - \( 0 \leq k \leq 10^{12} \)
4. **Output Requirements**: 
   - If no such permutation exists, output "No".
   - Otherwise, output "Yes" followed by the permutation.

### Program Analysis

The provided code consists of several functions. Let's break down what each function does:

1. **`func_1(n, k)`**: This function seems to generate a permutation based on the given \( n \) and \( k \). It modifies the list `l` which initially contains numbers from 1 to \( n \). The function iteratively adjusts the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value \( k \).
   
2. **`func_2(c, k, l)`**: This function swaps elements in the list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value. It takes into account the current count `c` and the remaining \( k \) to be achieved.

3. **`func_3(c, l)`**: This function also swaps elements in the list `l`. It swaps the element at position \( c-1 \) with the element at position \(-c\).

4. **`func_4()`**: This function reads input values \( n \) and \( k \), checks if \( k \) is even (since the Manhattan value of a permutation is always even), and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for the given \( n \). If \( k \) exceeds this maximum, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.

5. **`func_5(l)`**: This function prints "YES" and the permutation if a valid permutation is found.

6. **`func_6()`**: This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4()` to get \( n \) and \( k \), then calling `func_1()` to generate the permutation if possible, and finally printing the result using `func_5()`.

### Issues and Corrections

1. **Even Check for \( k \)**: The code correctly checks if \( k \) is even since the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
2. **Maximum Manhattan Value Calculation**: The calculation of the maximum Manhattan value seems correct. For odd \( n \), it is \((n^2 - 1) / 2\), and for even \( n \), it is \( n^2 / 2 \).
3. **Permutation Generation**: The logic for generating the permutation in `func_1()`, `func_2()`, and `func_3()` is complex and involves swapping elements to adjust the Manhattan value. However, without a detailed proof or explanation of why these specific swaps achieve the desired Manhattan value, it's hard to verify correctness definitively.

### Conclusion

While the code appears to follow a logical approach to solve the problem, the complexity of the permutation generation logic (`func_1()`, `func_2()`, `func_3()`) makes it difficult to verify correctness without a formal proof. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the code might work for many cases, but without a rigorous proof, we cannot guarantee it works for all possible inputs.

Therefore, based on the provided analysis, the correctness of the program is uncertain.
