You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and k is a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value.
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if 1 + i > k:
            x = l[-1]
            l.pop(-1)
            l.insert(-k, x)
            return l
        
        k = k - i + 1
        
        x = l[-1]
        
        l.pop(-1)
        
        l.insert(0, x)
        
    #State: The list `l` is rearranged such that the last element is moved to the front or to a specific position based on `k` until `k` becomes 0, at which point the current arrangement of `l` is returned.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and `k`, a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value. Depending on the values of `n` and `k`, the function returns different permutations of integers from 1 to `n`. Specifically, it returns a list `l` that follows one of the following cases: (1) a simple list of integers from 1 to `n`; (2) a list of integers from 1 to `n-1` with `n` inserted at the `-k` position; (3) a list starting with `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-1`; (4) a list starting with `n`, followed by `n-1` inserted at position `-k` from the end, and then including integers from 1 to `n-2`; (5) a list `l` that is not defined in the initial state; (6) the value of `l`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a list `l` which contains integers from 1 to `n`.

Case_2: The program returns a list `l` which consists of integers from 1 to `n-1` with `n` inserted at the `-k` position.

Case_3: The program returns a list `l` that starts with the integer `n` followed by integers from `1` to `n-1`.

Case_4: The program returns a list `l` that starts with `n`, followed by `n-1` inserted at position `-k` from the end, and then includes integers from `1` to `n-2`.

Case_5: The program returns l, which is not defined in the initial state

Case_6: The program returns the value of `l`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
