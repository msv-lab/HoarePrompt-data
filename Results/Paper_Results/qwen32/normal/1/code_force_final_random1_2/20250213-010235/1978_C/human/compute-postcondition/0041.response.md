Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and `k`, a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value. Depending on the values of `n` and `k`, the function returns different permutations of integers from 1 to `n`. Specifically, it returns a list `l` that follows one of the following cases: (1) a simple list of integers from 1 to `n`; (2) a list of integers from 1 to `n-1` with `n` inserted at the `-k` position; (3) a list starting with `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-1`; (4) a list starting with `n`, followed by `n-1` inserted at position `-k` from the end, and then including integers from 1 to `n-2`; (5) a list `l` that is not defined in the initial state; (6) the value of `l`.**
