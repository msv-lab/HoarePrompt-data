Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is not equal to 0, now equal to `k - i + 1`; `l` is a list modified by `func_3(2, l)` where `c` is 2; `c` is 2; `i` is 1. If `k < i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(2, k, l)`. Otherwise, the program continues with the rest of the code after the if-else block without returning.**
