The value of `c` is incremented by 1. Initially, `c` is 2, so after the operation, `c` becomes 3. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is not equal to 0; `l` is a list modified by `func_3(2, l)` twice; `c` is 3; `i` is 1**.
