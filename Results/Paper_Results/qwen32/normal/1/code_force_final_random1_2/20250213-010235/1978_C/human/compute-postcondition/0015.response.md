To determine the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is not equal to 0, now equal to `k - i + 1`
- `l` is a list modified by `func_3(c, l)`
- `c` is 2
- `i` is 1

Code Snippet:
```python
return l
```

Since the code simply returns the list `l`, the output state will be the state of `l` after it has been modified by `func_3(c, l)`. However, the details of `func_3(c, l)` are not provided, so we can only describe `l` as it is after this function call.

Output State: **The program returns the list `l` which has been modified by `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is 2.**
