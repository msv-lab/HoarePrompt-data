Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 200,000 inclusive, and `k`, a non-negative integer up to 1 trillion inclusive. Depending on the value of `k`, the function performs different operations on a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`. If `k` is 0, it returns the list `l`. If `k` is not 0, it proceeds through a series of cases involving modifications to `l` using `func_3` and computations using `func_2`. Specifically, Case 1 returns `l` directly if `k` is 0. Case 2 applies `func_2` with arguments 1 and `k` to the list `l`. Case 3 modifies `l` once with `func_3` using argument 2. Case 4 applies `func_2` with arguments 2 and `k` to the modified list `l`. Case 5 modifies `l` twice with `func_3` using argument 2. Case 6 applies `func_2` with argument 3 and `k` to the list `l`.**
