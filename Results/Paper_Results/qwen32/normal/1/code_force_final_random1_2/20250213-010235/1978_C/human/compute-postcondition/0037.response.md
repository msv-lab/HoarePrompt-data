The code snippet assigns the last element of list `l` to variable `x`. Given the initial state, no changes occur to `n`, `i`, or `k` except for the assignment to `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is now `k - i + 1`. If `1 + i > k`, the program would return the value of `l`, but no return occurs here. `x` is the last element of `l`.**
