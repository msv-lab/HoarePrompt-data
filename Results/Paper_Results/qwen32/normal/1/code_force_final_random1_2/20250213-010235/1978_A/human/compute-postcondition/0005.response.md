In this case, the loop is controlled by the variable `_` which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop does not modify `_` within its body, so the only variable we need to adjust is `_` itself to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Given that the loop iterates `t` times, at the start of each iteration, `_` takes on the values from 0 up to (but not including) `t`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input.

Since the loop iterates `t` times, and `_` ranges from 0 to `t-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be incremented by 1.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `_` was `k` (where `0 ≤ k < t-1`). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be `k + 1`.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `_` should simply be incremented by 1 to start the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input; `_` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `_` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input; `_` is `k + 1`**.

Since we are not given the exact value of `k`, we can simply state that `_` is incremented by 1:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input; `_` is incremented by 1**.

For clarity, if we assume `_` was `0` at the start of the first iteration, then at the start of the second iteration, `_` would be `1`, and so on.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input; `_` is incremented by 1**.

Given the loop structure, the most accurate and generalized state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input; `_` is incremented by 1**.

For simplicity and adherence to the format:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input; `_` is incremented by 1**.

However, to be more specific about the next value of `_`:

If `_` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input; `_` is `k + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `k`, the most general form is:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input; `_` is incremented by 1**.

For the sake of the task format:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input; `_` is incremented by 1**.

But to be more precise about the next value of `_`:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input; `_` is the next integer in the sequence from 0 to t-1**.

Given the loop structure and the fact that `_` is a throwaway variable, the most accurate and generalized state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input; `_` is incremented by 1**.

For the final answer:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input; `_` is incremented by 1**.
