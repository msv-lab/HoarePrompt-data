To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes each test case.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is the number of test cases to process (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500).
   - For each test case, `n` is the number of integers in the list (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100).
   - The list `nums` contains `n` integers.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - In each iteration, it reads an integer `n`, then reads a list of `n` integers.
   - It calculates the sum of the maximum value in the list excluding the last element (`max(nums[:-1])`) and the last element (`nums[-1]`).
   - It prints this calculated sum.

3. **Output State after All Iterations**:
   - After processing all `t` test cases, the loop will have printed the required sums for each test case.
   - The variable `_` (which is used as a counter in the loop) will have been incremented `t` times, reaching its final value of `t`.
   - The variables `n` and `nums` will hold the values from the last processed test case.

Given the above, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `t` remains the same as the initial input, representing the total number of test cases processed.
- `_` will be equal to `t` after the loop completes, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- `n` and `nums` will reflect the values from the last test case processed.

Since the problem asks for the output state after all executions of the loop, and the primary outputs are the printed sums, the final output state in terms of variables is:

Output State: **`t` is the initial number of test cases, `_` is equal to `t` after the loop, `n` and `nums` contain the values from the last test case.**

However, since the question specifically asks for the output state in the given format, and considering the loop's effect on the variables involved:

Output State: **`_` is equal to `t`, `n` and `nums` contain the values from the last test case.**
