To determine what will be printed, let's break down the code and the initial state:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - `t` is an integer read from the input, representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500).
   - `n` is an integer read from the input, representing the number of elements in the list `nums`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code snippet provided is `print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])`.

3. **Understanding the Code**:
   - `nums[:-1]` gives us a sublist of `nums` excluding the last element.
   - `max(nums[:-1])` finds the maximum value in this sublist.
   - `nums[-1]` is the last element of the list `nums`.
   - The expression `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]` adds the maximum value from the sublist (excluding the last element) to the last element of the list.

4. **Output Description**:
   - The output will be the result of adding the maximum value from the sublist of `nums` (excluding the last element) to the last element of `nums`.

Given the above steps, the precise description of what will be printed is:

Output: **the maximum value from the sublist of `nums` (excluding the last element) plus the last element of `nums`**.
