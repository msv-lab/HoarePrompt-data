You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1
    
    5
    
    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
        
    #State: `_` is equal to `t`, `n` and `nums` contain the values from the last test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The goal is to divide the books into two non-empty piles and maximize the sum of the largest book in each pile. However, the current implementation always takes the largest book from all but the last book (`max(nums[:-1])`) and adds it to the last book (`nums[-1]`). This approach does not guarantee the maximum possible sum of the largest books in each pile.

Consider the following counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
7
```
This is because Alice can divide the books into piles `{1, 2, 3}` and `{4}`, reading the largest book from each pile, which are `3` and `4`, respectively. Thus, the total number of pages read is `3 + 4 = 7`.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
6
```
The program incorrectly calculates the result as `6` because it considers `max(1, 2, 3) + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7` but due to its flawed logic, it might not always choose the optimal split.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases optimally.
