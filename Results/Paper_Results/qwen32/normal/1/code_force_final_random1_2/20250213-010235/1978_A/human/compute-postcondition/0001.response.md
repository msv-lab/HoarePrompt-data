In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning it is not used within the loop body. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `t`.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer read from the input and is constrained by \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), no adjustment is needed for `t` itself to ensure the loop executes. The loop will execute `t` times based on the value of `t`.

Since the loop variable `_` is not relevant to the state before the loop starts (it is just a placeholder), there is no need to adjust its state.

Thus, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute as intended.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500**
