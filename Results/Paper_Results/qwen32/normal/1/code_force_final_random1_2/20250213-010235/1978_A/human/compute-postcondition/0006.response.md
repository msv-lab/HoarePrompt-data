The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that the previous value of `n` is overwritten by the new input value. The variables `t`, `nums`, and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input; `_` is incremented by 1**.
