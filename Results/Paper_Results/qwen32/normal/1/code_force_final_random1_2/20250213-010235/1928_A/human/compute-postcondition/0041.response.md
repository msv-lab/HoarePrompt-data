The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration in a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given context, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input minus 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `a1` is `a // 2`, `a2` is `a // 2`.**
