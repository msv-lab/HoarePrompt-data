Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer read from the input, and `b` is the second integer read from the input. At least one of `a` or `b` is odd. If `a - b == -a` and `a` is the current value, or `b - a == -b` and `b` is the current value, then the condition holds as specified. Otherwise, neither `2a` equals `b` nor `2b` equals `a`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the difference between `a` and `b` is non-zero, meaning `(a - b) % 2` is either greater than 0 or less than 0. If `a` is equal to `b`, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd.**
