The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these details do not influence the content of the `print` statement. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'no'` without referencing any of the variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
2. The variables `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, with at least one of them being odd.
3. There are specific conditions involving `a` and `b` related to their differences, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement.

Despite the detailed conditions and the values of `a` and `b`, the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on these variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
