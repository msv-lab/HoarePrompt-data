### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
Bob can form a new rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then reassemble them into a different rectangle. The key points are:
- If both dimensions `a` and `b` are even, Bob can always form a new rectangle.
- If either dimension is odd, Bob can form a new rectangle unless the rectangle is already a square (i.e., `a == b`).

#### Code Analysis:
The code iterates through each test case and checks the conditions as follows:
1. If both `a` and `b` are even (`a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`), it prints "yes".
2. It then checks if `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)`. This condition seems incorrect and doesn't make logical sense in the context of the problem. It appears to be a typo or misunderstanding of the logic.
3. The next condition checks if `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`, which is always true if `a != b` because the difference between two unequal numbers is never zero. This condition should instead check if `a != b`.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "no".

#### Correct Conditions:
- If `a == b`, print "no" because a square cannot form a different rectangle.
- If `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`, print "yes" because both dimensions are even.
- If `a != b`, print "yes" because Bob can form a new rectangle by cutting and rearranging.

#### Issues in the Code:
- The second condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` is incorrect and doesn't contribute to the logic.
- The third condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always true when `a != b` and doesn't correctly handle the case where `a == b`.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle. Specifically, the second and third conditions are flawed.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
