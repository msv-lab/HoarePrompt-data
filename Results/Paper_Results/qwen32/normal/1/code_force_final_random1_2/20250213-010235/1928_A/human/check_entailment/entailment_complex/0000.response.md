Let's analyze the logic of the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob can form another rectangle if he can cut the given rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle that is not just a 90-degree rotation of the original.

- If both dimensions `a` and `b` are even, then Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
- If `a` and `b` are not both even, Bob can only form a new rectangle if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even. This is because he can cut the larger side into two parts, and if the difference is even, he can rearrange the pieces to form a new rectangle.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

1. **Condition 1**: `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` 
   - This correctly identifies when both dimensions are even and prints "yes".
   
2. **Condition 2**: `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):`
   - This condition is incorrect. The tuple expressions `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` do not make sense in this context. It seems like the intention was to check if the difference is zero, but the syntax is wrong. The correct condition should be checking if `a == b`.
   
3. **Condition 3**: `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:`
   - This condition is also incorrect. It checks if the difference is non-zero, which is not the correct condition. The correct condition should be checking if the absolute difference `(abs(a - b)) % 2 == 0`.
   
4. **Else Condition**: `else: print('no')`
   - This is reached when none of the previous conditions are met. However, due to the incorrect conditions above, this might not work as intended.

### Correct Conditions:
- If both `a` and `b` are even, print "yes".
- If `a` and `b` are not both even, print "yes" if `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`, otherwise print "no".

### Correct Implementation:
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
