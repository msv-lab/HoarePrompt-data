The given code snippet assigns `a1` and `a2` to `a // 2`. This means that regardless of the initial conditions specified for `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2`, these two variables (`a1` and `a2`) are now explicitly set to half of `a`.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer read from input, and it has already been decremented by 1. The values of `a` and `b` are also read from input. The conditions about `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` being set based on the parity of `a` and `b` are not relevant here because the code snippet directly sets `a1` and `a2` to `a // 2`.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input minus 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `a1` is `a // 2`, `a2` is `a // 2`.**
