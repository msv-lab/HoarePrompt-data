Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer that was initially read from input minus 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from input.
- If `a` is even, then `a1` and `a2` are both set to `a // 2`, provided `a1` is not equal to `b`. If `a` is odd, no changes are made to `a1` and `a2`.
- `b1` and `b2` are both equal to `b // 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. It does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, or `b2`. Therefore, regardless of the values of these variables, the output will always be `'Yes'`.

### Output:
Output: **Yes**
