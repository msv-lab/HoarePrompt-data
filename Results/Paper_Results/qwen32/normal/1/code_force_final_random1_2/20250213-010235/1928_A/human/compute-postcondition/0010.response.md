To determine the postcondition, we need to consider the negation of the if condition. The if condition provided is:

```python
if ((a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0):
```

This condition checks whether the difference `(a - b)` is not zero (i.e., it is either positive or negative). The negation of this condition would mean that `(a - b)` is zero, i.e., `a` is equal to `b`.

Given the precondition, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the first integer read from the input.
- `b` is the second integer read from the input.
- At least one of `a` or `b` is odd.
- Neither `2a` equals `b` nor `2b` equals `a`.

Since the program does not enter the if block, the negation of the if condition must hold true, meaning `a` must be equal to `b`. However, this contradicts the precondition that at least one of `a` or `b` is odd and neither `2a` equals `b` nor `2b` equals `a`. Therefore, the only way to satisfy both the precondition and the negation of the if condition is to ensure that the specific constraints about `a` and `b` are maintained while acknowledging that the if condition's logic is not met.

Thus, the postcondition should reflect that `a` is equal to `b` despite the initial constraints, which implies a special scenario where these constraints might still hold in a degenerate sense.

Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is equal to `b`, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd, and neither `2a` equals `b` nor `2b` equals `a`.** 

However, since `a` being equal to `b` directly contradicts the precondition that neither `2a` equals `b` nor `2b` equals `a`, the postcondition should focus on the fact that `a` equals `b` while maintaining the other conditions as much as possible within the logical framework.

Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is equal to `b`, and at least one of `a` or `b` is odd.**
