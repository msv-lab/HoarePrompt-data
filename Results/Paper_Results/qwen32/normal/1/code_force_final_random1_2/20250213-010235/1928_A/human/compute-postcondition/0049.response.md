Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer that was initially read from input minus 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from input.
- If `a` is even, then `a1` and `a2` are both set to `a // 2`, provided `a1` is not equal to `b`. If `a` is odd, no changes are made to `a1` and `a2`.
- If `b` is even, `b1` and `b2` are both equal to `b // 2`, provided `b1` is not equal to `a`. If `b` is odd, `b1` and `b2` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. This output does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, or `b2`. The conditions and calculations described in the initial state do not influence the content of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always output the string `'No'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
