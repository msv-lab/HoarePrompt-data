Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the first integer read from the input.
- `b` is the second integer read from the input.
- At least one of `a` or `b` is odd.
- Neither `2a` equals `b` nor `2b` equals `a`.
- The difference between `a` and `b` is non-zero, meaning \((a - b) \% 2\) is either greater than 0 or less than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet directly outputs the string `'yes'`. This output is independent of the values of `t`, `a`, and `b` as described in the initial state. The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the execution of this particular `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'yes'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **yes**
