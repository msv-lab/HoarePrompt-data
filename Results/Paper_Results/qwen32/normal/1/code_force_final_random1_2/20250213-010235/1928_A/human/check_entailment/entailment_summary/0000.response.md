Let's analyze the logic of the given program and compare it with the problem requirements to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
- Given a rectangle of size `a x b`, Bob wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles and then form a new rectangle from these two.
- If the new rectangle is different from the original (ignoring rotation), the answer should be "Yes".
- Otherwise, the answer should be "No".

### Key Observations:
- A rectangle `a x b` can be cut into two rectangles by either cutting along the length `a` or the width `b`.
- To form a new rectangle, the two smaller rectangles must have dimensions that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are even, the rectangle can always be divided into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- If `a` and `b` are not both even, the only way to form a new rectangle is if one dimension is exactly twice the other. For example, a `2x6` rectangle can be cut into two `2x3` rectangles, which can be rearranged into a `4x3` rectangle.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:`**
   - This correctly identifies cases where both dimensions are even, which means a new rectangle can always be formed.
   
2. **Condition `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):`**
   - This condition seems intended to check if one dimension is twice the other, but it is incorrectly implemented.
   - The expression `(a - b == -a, a)` evaluates to a tuple `(False, a)` if `a - b != -a`, which is never true for positive integers `a` and `b`.
   - Similarly, `(b - a == -b, b)` evaluates to a tuple `(False, b)`.
   - Therefore, this condition will always evaluate to `False`.

3. **Condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:`**
   - This condition checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is non-zero and odd or even.
   - However, this does not correctly identify the cases where one dimension is twice the other.
   - It will print 'yes' for any pair where `a` and `b` are not both even and not equal, which is incorrect.

4. **Default Condition `else:`**
   - This defaults to printing 'no' if none of the above conditions are met.
   - Since the second condition is always `False`, and the third condition is not correctly identifying the cases where one dimension is twice the other, this default case will incorrectly handle many valid scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly identify all cases where a new rectangle can be formed. Specifically, it incorrectly handles cases where one dimension is twice the other, and it incorrectly uses the third condition to determine when a new rectangle can be formed.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when one dimension is twice the other. The logic for checking if a new rectangle can be formed is flawed.
Correctness: **False**
