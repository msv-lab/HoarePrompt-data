The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) but does not specify their exact values. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on these variables. It simply prints the string `'no'`.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1, but this operation does not affect the `print` statement.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('no')
```

This statement will output the string `'no'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

Output: **no**
