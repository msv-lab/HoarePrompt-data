### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided code, considering the annotations and the original assessment.

#### Problem Recap:
Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) and wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. He then tries to form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles. Two rectangles are considered the same if one can be rotated to form the other.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Cutting Parallel to Sides:**
   - If the rectangle is cut parallel to the side of length \(a\) (assuming \(a\) is even), the resulting rectangles will have dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\).
   - If the rectangle is cut parallel to the side of length \(b\) (assuming \(b\) is even), the resulting rectangles will have dimensions \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\).

2. **Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If \(a\) is even, the two resulting rectangles can be arranged to form a new rectangle with dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times 2b\).
   - If \(b\) is even, the two resulting rectangles can be arranged to form a new rectangle with dimensions \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\).

3. **Checking for Equivalence:**
   - The new rectangle should not be equivalent to the original rectangle. This means the dimensions of the new rectangle should not be \((a, b)\) or \((b, a)\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even and then proceeds to check specific conditions:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            if a % 2 == 0:
                (a1, a2) = (a // 2, a // 2)
                if a1 != b:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            if b % 2 == 0:
                (b1, b2) = (b // 2, b // 2)
                if b1 != a:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            print('No')
        else:
            print('No')
```
##### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking New Rectangle Formation:**
   - The code checks if `a1 != b` after cutting `a` into two equal parts. This does not correctly determine if the new rectangle formed is different from the original.
   - Similarly, it checks if `b1 != a` after cutting `b` into two equal parts. This also does not correctly determine if the new rectangle formed is different from the original.

2. **Simplified Check Needed:**
   - The simplified check is that if either `a` or `b` is even, it is always possible to form a new rectangle that is not equivalent to the original one.

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm the state of the program before and after processing each test case. They do not indicate any logical errors in the flow but highlight the specific conditions checked by the code.

#### Revised Code:
The correct approach is:
- If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, the answer is "Yes".
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the answer is "No".

Revised code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

#### Conclusion:
The original code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a new rectangle can be formed. The original assessment is correct in identifying the issues with the provided code. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
