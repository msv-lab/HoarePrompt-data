Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
2. **test_cases**: An integer that is greater than or equal to 1.
3. **feat**: A list of integers obtained from the input. The first element `n` is greater than 1.
4. **f**: The second element of `feat`.
5. **a**: The third element of `feat`.
6. **b**: The last element of `feat`.
7. **arr**: A list of integers obtained from the new input.
8. **array2**: Contains the elements `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.
9. **Sum Condition**: The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains only one line: `print('No')`. This line directly prints the string `'No'` to the console, regardless of the values of any variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'No'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
