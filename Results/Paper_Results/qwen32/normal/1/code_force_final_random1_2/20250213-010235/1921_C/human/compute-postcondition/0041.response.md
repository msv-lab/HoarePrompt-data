The given code appends a calculated value to the `array2` list. The value being appended is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. 

Given the initial state, `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` has already been incremented before this line of code is executed. Therefore, `arr[i]` refers to the current element in the `arr` list, and `arr[i - 1]` refers to the previous element.

The calculation `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` computes the difference between the current and previous elements of `arr` and multiplies it by `a`. This result is then appended to `array2`.

Since the initial state specifies that `t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` have certain values or conditions, these remain unchanged except for `array2`, which now includes the newly appended value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` includes the newly appended value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**
