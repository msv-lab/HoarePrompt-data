The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `arr`. This operation does not affect the variables `t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, or `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.**
