The code snippet assigns the second element of the list `feat` to the variable `f`. The initial state specifies that `feat` is a list of integers and `n` is the first element of `feat`. After executing the code, `f` will hold the value of the second element of `feat`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`.**
