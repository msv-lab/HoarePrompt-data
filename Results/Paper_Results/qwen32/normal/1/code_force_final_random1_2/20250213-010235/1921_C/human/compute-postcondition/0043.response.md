To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider how the loop progresses and modifies the variables involved.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
- For each iteration, it checks if the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (i.e., `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`) is less than `b / a`.
- If the condition is met, it appends `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`.

### Final Output State:
- The variable `i` will have completed all iterations, meaning it will have taken on every integer value from 1 to `n-1`.
- The list `array2` will contain all the values `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for which the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` was true during the iterations.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

### Conclusion:
The final output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `n` (since the loop runs until `i` reaches `n-1`), `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input line, and `array2` contains all values `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for which `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` was true during the iterations.**

In simpler terms, `array2` will have all the calculated values where the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` was less than `b / a`, scaled by `a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
