Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers, `i` is `n`, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is a list containing all elements `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` for `i` ranging from `1` to `n-1`. Additionally, the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.**
