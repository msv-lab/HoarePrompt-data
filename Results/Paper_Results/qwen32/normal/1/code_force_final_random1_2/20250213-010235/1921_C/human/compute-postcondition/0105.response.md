Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is a variable (its value is not specified).
2. `feat` is a list of integers.
3. `n` is the first element of `feat` (`feat[0]`).
4. `b` is the last element of `feat` (`feat[-1]`).
5. `f` is the second element of `feat` (`feat[1]`).
6. `a` is the third element of `feat` (`feat[2]`).
7. `arr` is a list of integers.
8. `i` is set to `n` (the first element of `feat`).
9. `array2` is constructed based on specific conditions:
   - It starts with `[arr[0] * a]` if `arr[0] < b / a`.
   - For each `j` from `1` to `n-1`, it includes `[(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a]` if `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a`.
10. The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is `'Yes'`, regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions specified in the initial state.

Output: **Yes**
