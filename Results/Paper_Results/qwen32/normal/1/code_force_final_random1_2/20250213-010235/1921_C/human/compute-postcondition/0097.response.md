The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and `n` (which is `feat[0]`). Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables.

From the description, we know that `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Since the loop condition is `for i in range(0, n)`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given that `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it means that at the start of the current iteration, `i` should be 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is defined as `feat[0]` and there is no indication that `feat[0]` changes within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is a variable, `n` (which is `feat[0]`) is greater than 0, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `feat` is a list of integers where `feat[0]` > 0, and `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 1**
