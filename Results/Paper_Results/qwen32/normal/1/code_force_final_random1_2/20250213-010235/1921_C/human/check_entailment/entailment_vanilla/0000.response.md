Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis

Stepan needs to send `n` messages at specific times (`m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`) using a phone with limited battery. The phone consumes `a` units of charge per unit of time and `b` units of charge every time it is turned on and off. The goal is to determine whether Stepan can send all messages without running out of battery.

### Key Points

1. **Initial Charge:** `f`
2. **Charge Consumption:** `a` units per unit of time.
3. **Turn On/Off Cost:** `b` units of charge.
4. **Message Times:** Sorted list `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we need to decide whether to keep the phone on between consecutive messages or turn it off and on again. The decision depends on the time gap between consecutive messages and the cost of keeping the phone on versus turning it off and on.

- If the time gap between two consecutive messages is less than `b/a`, it is cheaper to keep the phone on during this period.
- Otherwise, it is cheaper to turn the phone off and on again.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided code:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[-1]
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        array2 = []
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
                array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

#### Issues in the Code

1. **Logic Error in Decision Making:**
   - The code checks if the time gap between two messages is less than `b/a`. If true, it adds the charge consumed by keeping the phone on during this period to `array2`.
   - However, it does not account for the fact that turning the phone off and on also incurs a cost `b` for each message except possibly the first one.
   - The code sums up the charges in `array2` and adds `(n - len(array2)) * b` to it. This logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly account for the scenarios where the phone should be turned off and on.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle cases where the initial charge `f` is insufficient even if the phone is turned off and on optimally.

### Correct Approach

A correct approach would involve iterating through the message times and making decisions based on the cost of keeping the phone on versus turning it off and on. Here's a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        times = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        current_charge = f
        previous_time = 0
        
        for time in times:
            time_gap = time - previous_time
            
            # Check if we can keep the phone on until the next message
            if current_charge >= time_gap * a:
                current_charge -= time_gap * a
            else:
                # Turn off and on the phone
                if current_charge >= b:
                    current_charge -= b
                else:
                    print("NO")
                    break
                
                # Reset charge after turning on
                current_charge -= a
            
            previous_time = time
        else:
            print("YES")

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of battery. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
