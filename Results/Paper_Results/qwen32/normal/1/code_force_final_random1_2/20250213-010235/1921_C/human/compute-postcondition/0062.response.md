The given code appends a calculated value to the list `array2`. Specifically, it appends the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1.
- `feat` is a list of integers.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1.
- `f` is `feat[1]`.
- `a` is `feat[2]`.
- `b` is `feat[-1]`.
- `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line.
- `array2` is initially an empty list unless the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is met, in which case it contains one element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.

The code snippet provided:
```python
array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
```
This line unconditionally appends `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`, regardless of the condition mentioned earlier.

Thus, the updated state of `array2` will include the new element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line, `array2` is a list containing the element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**
