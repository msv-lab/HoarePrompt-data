The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1.

Since the loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i < n`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Let's update the state accordingly:
- `i` should be 2 (since it was 1 at the end of the previous iteration).
- `n` remains the same as it is dependent on `feat[0]`.

Other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `array2`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1, `feat` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, `array2` is a list containing one element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.**
