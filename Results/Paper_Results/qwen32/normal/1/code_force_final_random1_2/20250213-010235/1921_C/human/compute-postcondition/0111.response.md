Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers (`n`, `f`, `a`, `b`) and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a cost based on the differences between consecutive integers in the list and compares this cost to `f`. If the calculated cost is less than `f`, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".**
