You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4. s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`; `l` is `n`; `r` is `-1`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`; `l` is `n`; `r` is `-1`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order, modulo `m`; `p` is the product of all elements in `b` in reverse order, modulo `m`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` in reverse order, where each element of `ans` is the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order, modulo `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of lists `a` and string `s`), `m` (an integer used as a modulus), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It also accepts a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. The function computes a list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of elements in another list `b` in reverse order, taken modulo `m`. The function then returns the list `ans` in reverse order.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `ans` in reverse order, where each element of `ans` is the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order, modulo `m`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
