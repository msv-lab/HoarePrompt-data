The code appends the element at index `l` (which is 0) from the list `a` to the list `b`. Since `l` is 0, `a[l]` refers to the first element of the list `a`. Therefore, the first element of `a` is added to `b`.

Given the initial state, the value of `l` remains 0, `r` remains `n - 1`, and the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`) remain unchanged. The only change is that `b` now contains the first element of `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing the first element of `a`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`.**
