Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `i` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` contains the element `a[1]` and `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b` has an additional element `a[r+1]` appended to it and `r` is decreased by 1.**
