The only object in the loop head is the variable `v`, which is iterated over the reversed list `b`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `v` to the next element in the reversed list `b`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4;
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5;
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4;
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 and `n` is at least 1;
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R';
- `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s` and `b` has at least one element;
- `l` is `n`;
- `r` is `-1`;
- `ans` is a list containing the value of `p` twice;
- `p` is `(p * v) % m`;
- `v` is the next element in the reversed list `b`.

Since `v` is the current element being processed in the reversed list `b`, at the start of the next iteration, `v` should be the next element in this reversed traversal.

Let's denote the current index of `v` in the reversed list as `index_v`. Since we don't have the exact value of `index_v`, we can say that `v` was the `index_v`-th element from the end of `b` in the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `v` will be the `(index_v + 1)`-th element from the end of `b`.

However, since we don't have the exact position of `v` in the list, we can simply state that `v` will be the next element in the reversed list `b`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 and `n` is at least 1; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s` and `b` has at least one element; `l` is `n`; `r` is `-1`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `p` twice; `p` is `(p * v) % m`; `v` is the next element in the reversed list `b`.**
