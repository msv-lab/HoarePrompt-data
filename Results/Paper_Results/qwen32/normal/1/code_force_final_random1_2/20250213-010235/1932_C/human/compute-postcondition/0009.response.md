Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing the single element `a[n - 1]`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 2`; `s[i]` is not 'L'.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so if `r` was initially `n - 1`, it is now `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
