The given code snippet modifies the value of `r` by decrementing it by 1. No other variables are directly modified by this code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'
- `i` is 4
- `b` contains the element `a[r]` appended to it
- `r` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the code snippet

Since `r` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value before the operation. However, after the operation `r -= 1`, the new value of `r` will be its previous value minus 1.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `i` is 4; `b` contains the element `a[r]` appended to it; `r` is decreased by 1.**
