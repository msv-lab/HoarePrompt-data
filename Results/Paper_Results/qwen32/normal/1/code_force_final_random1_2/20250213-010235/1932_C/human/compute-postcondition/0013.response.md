The given code snippet increments the variable `l` by 1. However, there is no initial value provided for `l` in the Initial State. Since the problem statement does not specify the initial value of `l`, we can only state that `l` is now one more than its previous value.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `i` is 1; `b` contains the element `a[1]`; `l` is incremented by 1.**
