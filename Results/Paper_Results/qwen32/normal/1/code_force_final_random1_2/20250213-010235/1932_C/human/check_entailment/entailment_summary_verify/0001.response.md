### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to process a series of commands ('L' or 'R') on an array `a` of length `n`.
- For each command, we must:
  1. Output the remainder of the product of all elements of the current array `a` when divided by `m`.
  2. Remove the leftmost element if the command is 'L', or the rightmost element if the command is 'R'.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program has the following structure:
1. **Reading Input:** Correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. **Processing Commands:**
   - Constructs a list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the commands.
   - Computes the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order and stores the results in `ans`.
   - Returns `ans` in the correct order.

However, the key issue lies in how the product is computed and when the elements are removed from `a`.

#### Function Summary Recap:
The function summary describes that `func_1`:
- Constructs a list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the commands.
- Computes a list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order, modulo `m`.
- Returns the list `ans` in reverse order.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The program incorrectly calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order, rather than calculating the product of the current state of `a` before each removal.
- This mismatch between the intended logic and the actual implementation leads to incorrect results.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Initialize the product of all elements in `a`.
2. For each command:
   - Output the current product modulo `m`.
   - Update the product by removing the appropriate element (either the leftmost or rightmost) from `a`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    ans = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        ans.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[l], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove a[l] using modular inverse
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[r], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove a[r] using modular inverse
            r -= 1
    return ans
```

However, using modular inverse can be complex and may not work for all `m`. A simpler approach is to recalculate the product after each removal:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    for i in range(n):
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        ans.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            a.pop()
    return ans
```

#### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the original program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**

The original assessment accurately identified the issues in the program, and the provided reasoning supports this conclusion.
