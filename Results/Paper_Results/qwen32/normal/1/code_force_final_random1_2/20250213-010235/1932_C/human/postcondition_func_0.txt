The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (the length of list `a` and string `s`), `m` (a modulus), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the direction specified in `s`, then computes a list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order, modulo `m`. Finally, it returns the list `ans` in reverse order.
