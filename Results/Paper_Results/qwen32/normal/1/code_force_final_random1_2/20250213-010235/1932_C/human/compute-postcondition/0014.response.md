The code snippet `b.append(a[r])` appends the element at index `r` from the list `a` to the list `b`. Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `b` now includes the element `a[r]`.

Since the initial state does not specify the value of `r`, we cannot determine the exact value being appended to `b`. However, we know that `r` is an index used to access an element in the list `a`, and since `a` is a list of `n` integers, `r` must be within the range `0` to `n-1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `i` is incremented by 1; `b` has an additional element `a[r]` appended to it.**
