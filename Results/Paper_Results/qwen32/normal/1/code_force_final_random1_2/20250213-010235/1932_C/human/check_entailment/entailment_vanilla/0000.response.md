Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a` of length `n`, and the string `s` of length `n`.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1` that takes `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` as arguments.
   - Inside `func_1`, it initializes an empty list `b` to store elements based on the commands.
   - It uses two pointers, `l` (starting at 0) and `r` (starting at `n-1`), to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.
   - For each command in `s`:
     - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element (`a[l]`) to `b` and increments `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element (`a[r]`) to `b` and decrements `r`.

3. **Calculating Remainders:**
   - After constructing `b`, the program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the remainders.
   - It initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will be used to calculate the product of elements modulo `m`.
   - It iterates over `b` in reverse order, updating `p` with `(p * v) % m` for each element `v` in `b`.
   - It appends the updated `p` to `ans` after each multiplication.

4. **Returning Results:**
   - The function returns `reversed(ans)`, which means the remainders are returned in the correct order (from the first command to the last).

### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Product Calculation:**
  - The program calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order, but it should calculate the product of the remaining elements in `a` before each removal.
  - The current implementation does not correctly simulate the process described in the problem statement. Instead of calculating the product of the current state of `a` before each removal, it calculates the product of the elements collected in `b` in reverse order.

### Correct Approach:

To fix the program, we need to calculate the product of the current state of `a` before each removal. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        ans.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[l], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove a[l] using modular inverse
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[r], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove a[r] using modular inverse
            r -= 1
    return ans
```

However, the above approach uses modular inverse which might not work for all `m`. A simpler approach would be to recalculate the product after each removal:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    for i in range(n):
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        ans.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            a.pop()
    return ans
```

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
