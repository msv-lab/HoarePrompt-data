The only variable in the loop head is `v`, which iterates over the reversed list `b`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `v` for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was the current element from the reversed list `b`. For the next iteration, `v` should be the next element in the reversed list `b`.

Since `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`, and the loop is iterating over `b` in reverse, `v` should now be the next element in this reversed order.

Let's denote the current index of `v` in the reversed `b` as `k`. After the previous iteration, `k` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `v` should be `b[-(k+1)]`.

However, since we don't have the exact value of `k`, we can infer that `v` should simply be the next element in the reversed `b` list.

Given that the loop is starting its next iteration, `v` will take the value of the next element in the reversed `b` list.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 and `n` is at least 1; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s` and `b` has at least one element; `l` is `n`; `r` is `-1`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `p`; `p` is `(p * v) % m`; `v` is the next element in the reversed list `b`**
