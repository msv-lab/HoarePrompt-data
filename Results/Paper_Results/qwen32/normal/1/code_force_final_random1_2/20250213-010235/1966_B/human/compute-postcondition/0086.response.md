Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input, `i` is `n - 2`. If `impossible` is `True`, indicating that at least one pair of adjacent strings had differing first or last characters, then `ans` is `'NO'`. If `impossible` is `False`, `ans` remains `'NO'` as there is no else part to change it.**
