To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the loop's behavior and how it modifies the `impossible` variable based on the conditions provided.

The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-2` (since `range(n - 1)` generates indices from 0 to `n-2`). During each iteration, it checks if the first character (`gr[i][0]`) or the last character (`gr[i][m - 1]`) of the current row `i` is different from the corresponding character in the next row `i+1`. If any of these conditions are met, it sets `impossible` to `False`.

### Final Output State Analysis:
1. **Loop Completion**: The loop will run `n-1` times, checking each pair of consecutive rows.
2. **Modification of `impossible`**: The `impossible` variable starts as `True`. It will only be set to `False` if, during any of the iterations, the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` is satisfied for any `i` in the range `[0, n-2]`.

### Conclusion:
After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `impossible` will depend on whether any of the conditions inside the loop were met. If none of the conditions were met, `impossible` will remain `True`. If any condition was met, `impossible` will be `False`.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `m` remains at least 2.
- `gr` remains a list containing `n` strings read from the input.
- `tc` remains 0.
- `ans` remains `'NO'`.
- The first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) remains not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`).
- `impossible` will be `False` if any of the conditions `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` were met during the loop iterations; otherwise, it will remain `True`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` is at least 2; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is 0; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; `ans` is `'NO'`; the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`); `impossible` is `False` if any of the conditions `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` were met during the loop iterations; otherwise, `impossible` is `True`.**
