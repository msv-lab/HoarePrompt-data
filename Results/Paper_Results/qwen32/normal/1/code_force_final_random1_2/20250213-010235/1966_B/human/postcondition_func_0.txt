The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with 'W' and 'B'. It checks if the grid can be considered "valid" based on specific conditions related to the corners and edges of the grid. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if the grid meets the criteria or 'NO' otherwise.
