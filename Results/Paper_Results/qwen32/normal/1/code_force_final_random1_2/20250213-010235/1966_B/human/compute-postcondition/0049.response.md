The code appends a new element to the list `gr` by reading a line of input. This means `gr` is no longer an empty list but now contains one element, which is the string read from the input.

The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `tc`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Specifically, `t` is still an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the first integer read from the input and is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is still 1, and `ans` is still `'YES'` unless `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, but since `gr` only has one element, this condition cannot yet be evaluated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0; `m` is the second integer read from the input; `tc` is 1; `gr` is a list containing one string read from the input; `ans` is `'YES'`.**
