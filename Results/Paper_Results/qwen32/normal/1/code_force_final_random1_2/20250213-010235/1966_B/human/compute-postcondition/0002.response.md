The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. This means the initial values of `n` and `m` (which were within the range of 1 to 500) are being updated to the new values read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `tc`, and the grid) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop.**
