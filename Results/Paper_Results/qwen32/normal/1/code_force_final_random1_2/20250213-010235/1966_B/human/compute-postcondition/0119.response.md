Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (all input strings), `i` is `n-1`, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (i.e., `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `impossible` is `False`, `ans` is 'NO', and either the first character of the `i`-th string in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the `(i+1)`-th string in `gr` or the last character of the `i`-th string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the `(i+1)`-th string in `gr`.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `impossible` has been set to `False`. All other conditions and variable values remain the same.
