Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input. If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is `'NO'` and `i` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `'YES'` and `i` is `n - 1`.**
