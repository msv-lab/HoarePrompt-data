The given code snippet initializes a variable `impossible` to `False`. This does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` is at least 2; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; `ans` is `'YES'`; the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`. `j` is incremented by 1; `impossible` is `False`.**
