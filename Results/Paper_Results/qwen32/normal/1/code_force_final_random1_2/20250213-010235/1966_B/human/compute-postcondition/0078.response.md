The given code snippet simply sets the variable `impossible` to `False`. This means that regardless of its previous value, `impossible` will now be `False`.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `tc`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input, `i` is 1, `impossible` is `False`, and `ans` is `'NO'` because at least one pair of adjacent characters in the first and last strings of `gr` differ at any position from `0` to `m - 2`.**
