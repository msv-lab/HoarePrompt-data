Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0; `m` is the second integer read from the input; `tc` is 1; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input; `ans` is `'YES'`; `i` is `n - 1`. Additionally, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`.**
