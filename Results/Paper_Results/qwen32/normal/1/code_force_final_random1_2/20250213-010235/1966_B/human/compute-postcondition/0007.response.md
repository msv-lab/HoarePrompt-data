The code appends a new string (read from the input) to the list `gr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `tc`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that `gr` now contains one additional element, which is the newly appended string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `m` are the integers read from the input; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing `i + 1` strings read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`**.
