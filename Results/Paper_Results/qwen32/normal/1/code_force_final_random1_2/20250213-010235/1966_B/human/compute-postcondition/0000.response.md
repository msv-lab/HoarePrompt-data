`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n`, `m`, and the grid remain unchanged as they have not been affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 500; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'. The sum of `n` * `m` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
