The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-2` (since the range is `range(n - 1)`). To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is greater than 1
- `m` is at least 2
- The grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'
- `tc` is 0
- `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input
- `ans` is `'NO'`
- The first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`)
- If for some index `i`, either `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `k`, where `0 \leq k < n-1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 2, the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `tc` is 0, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input, `ans` is `'NO'`, the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 2, the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `tc` is 0, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input, `ans` is `'NO'`, the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

For the sake of providing a concrete example, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 2, the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `tc` is 0, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input, `ans` is `'NO'`, the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `i` is 3**.

However, without knowing the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, the most accurate general form is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 2, the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B', `tc` is 0, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input, `ans` is `'NO'`, the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
