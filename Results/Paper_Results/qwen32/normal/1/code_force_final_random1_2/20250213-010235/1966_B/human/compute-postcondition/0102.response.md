To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head:

```python
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop, the variable `j` iterates over the range `m - 1`. For the loop to execute, `m - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1, which implies that `m` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `m` is the second integer read from the input
- `tc` is 2
- `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (all input strings)
- `ans` is 'YES'
- `i` is `n-1`
- `impossible` is True
- The first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (i.e., `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`)

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `m`. To ensure the loop executes, `m` must be greater than 1.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (all input strings), `ans` is 'YES', `i` is `n-1`, `impossible` is True, and the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (i.e., `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`)**
