To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing one element (the input string), `ans` and `i` are undefined.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In the previous iteration, `i` would have been initialized or incremented to some value. Since this is the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value. However, since `i` was undefined at the end of the previous iteration, we assume it started at 0 for the first iteration. Therefore, at the start of the second iteration, `i` should be 1.

The variable `n` does not change within the loop head; it remains the same throughout all iterations.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes:
- `i` should be 1.
- `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (greater than 0).

Other variables (`t`, `m`, `tc`, `gr`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing one element (the input string), `ans` and `i` are undefined, `i` is 1**.

However, since `ans` and `i` being undefined doesn't make sense in the context of starting a new iteration where `i` should be defined, we correct that:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing one element (the input string), `ans` is undefined, `i` is 1**.
