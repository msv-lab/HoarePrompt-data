### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations. Here's a breakdown of the logic used in the program and whether it correctly addresses the problem:

1. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid have different colors.
   - If they are different, it means that there might be a possibility that the entire grid cannot be made uniform because the corners are different colors, and no operation can change the color of both corners simultaneously without affecting other cells in a way that could prevent uniformity.
   
2. **Edge Checks**: If the corners are different, the program then checks the edges of the grid:
   - It verifies if all adjacent cells in the top row (`gr[0][j]` and `gr[0][j+1]`) and the bottom row (`gr[n-1][j]` and `gr[n-1][j+1]`) are the same color.
   - Similarly, it checks if all adjacent cells in the leftmost column (`gr[i][0]` and `gr[i+1][0]`) and the rightmost column (`gr[i][m-1]` and `gr[i+1][m-1]`) are the same color.
   
3. **Conclusion**:
   - If either the top row or the bottom row has adjacent cells of different colors, or if the leftmost column or the rightmost column has adjacent cells of different colors, then it concludes that it is possible to make the entire grid uniform (by performing operations along those edges).
   - If all adjacent cells in the top/bottom rows and left/right columns are the same color, but the corners are different, then it concludes that it is not possible to make the entire grid uniform.

However, this logic is flawed. The program does not correctly handle all scenarios where the grid can be made uniform. Specifically, it fails to consider cases where the grid can be made uniform through operations that involve internal cells, not just the edges and corners. 

For example, consider a grid like this:
```
BWB
WBW
BWB
```
Here, the corners are different, but the grid can still be made uniform by selecting appropriate subrectangles. The current program would incorrectly conclude that this grid cannot be made uniform.

### Conclusion:
The program does not cover all possible scenarios and thus does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
