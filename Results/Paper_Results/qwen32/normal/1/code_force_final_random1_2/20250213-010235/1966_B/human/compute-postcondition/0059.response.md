Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `tc` is 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input, `ans` is `'YES'`, `i` is `n - 1`, `impossible` is `True`. Additionally, either `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`.**
