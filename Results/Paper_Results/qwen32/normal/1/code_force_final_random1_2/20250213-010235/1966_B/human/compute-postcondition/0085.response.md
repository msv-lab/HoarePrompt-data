Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `impossible` is `True` indicating that at least one pair of adjacent strings had differing first or last characters, and `ans` is `'NO'`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` was already set to `'NO'` in the Initial State, and the provided code snippet reassigns `ans` to `'NO'` again. This does not change the value of `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
