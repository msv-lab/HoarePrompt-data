Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 500; `tc` ranges from 0 to `t-1`; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input for each test case; `ans` is 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the code; all test cases have been processed.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the program will have processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, it will have read the dimensions `n` and `m`, and the grid `gr`. The variable `ans` will hold either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the conditions specified in the code are met for that particular grid. The loop index `tc` will have iterated from 0 to `t-1`, ensuring all test cases are handled.
