Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `m` are the integers read from the input; the grid is represented by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'; `tc` is initialized to 0 by the loop; `gr` is a list containing `n` strings read from the input.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `gr` will contain exactly `n` strings, each representing a line from the input grid. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, and `tc`) remain unchanged from their initial states as they are not modified within the loop.
