To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables involved.

The loop iterates `n` times, appending an input string to the list `gr` in each iteration. Given the initial state and the states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that after `n` iterations, the list `gr` will contain `n` elements, each being an input string.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it dictates the number of iterations.
- `m` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `tc` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `gr` will contain `n` elements, each being an input string.
- `ans` remains undefined as it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` will be `n-1` at the end of the loop since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `tc` is 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (all input strings), `ans` is undefined, `i` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all `n` iterations, `gr` will have `n` input strings, and the loop variable `i` will be `n-1`, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `tc`, and `ans`) will remain as they were initially or undefined.
