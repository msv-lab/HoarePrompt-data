Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations. The key observation here is that if there exists a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner where all squares along the path are of the same color, then it's possible to make the entire grid that color. This is because we can use operations to propagate the color along this path.

### Program Analysis:
The program checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color. If they don't, it then checks if there is a consistent color along the top row and the bottom row, or along the leftmost column and the rightmost column. If neither of these conditions holds, it concludes that it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color.

However, this logic is flawed. The program only checks the boundaries and doesn't consider other paths within the grid that might allow the entire grid to be filled with a single color.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following grid:
```
WBB
BWB
BBW
```
Here, the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors ('W' and 'W' respectively), but the program would incorrectly conclude that it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color because the top row and bottom row are not consistently colored.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve checking if there is a connected component of the same color that spans from the top-left to the bottom-right corner, or if the entire grid can be filled with a single color by considering all possible paths.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
