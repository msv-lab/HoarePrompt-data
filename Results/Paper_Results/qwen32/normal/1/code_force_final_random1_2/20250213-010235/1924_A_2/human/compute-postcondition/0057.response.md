The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `i` is in the range `[0, t-1]`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken some value between `0` and `t-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, provided it is still within the bounds of the loop.

Let's break down the state adjustments:

- `i` should be incremented by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `ans`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

So, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the string read from the input; `cnt` is the number of times k distinct characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 or (1 << k) - 1 depending on the last sequence; `ans` is a string containing the characters that completed the sequences of k distinct characters. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, no further changes are made to `ans`. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is extended by `tmp` followed by `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters, where `tmp` is either an empty string or the character `'a' + i` with `i` being the smallest index such that `(cur & 1 << i == 0)` within the range `[0, k-1]`. `i` is incremented by 1**.
