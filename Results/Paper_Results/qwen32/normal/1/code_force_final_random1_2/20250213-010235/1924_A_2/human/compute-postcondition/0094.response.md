Given the initial state described, let's break down the variables and the context:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, inclusive.
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `s` is a string read from the input.
- `cnt` is the count of how many times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively in `s`.
- `cur` is a bitmask representing the last incomplete set of unique characters if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters; otherwise, it is 0.
- `ans` is a string containing characters from `s` that completed sets of `k` unique characters.
- `cnt` is less than `n`.

The Python code snippet provided is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, or `ans`. The output does not depend on any of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
