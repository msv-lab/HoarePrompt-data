Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, and `ans` have specific roles and values, but the `print` statement only outputs the string `'YES'`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variables and Conditions**:
   - `t`: An integer within the range 1 to 10^5, representing the number of test cases (though it doesn't directly influence the current print statement).
   - `n`, `k`, `m`: Integers read from the input.
   - `s`: A string read from the input.
   - `cnt`: The number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively in `s`, and it is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `n`.
   - `cur`: A bitmask representing the last incomplete set of unique characters if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters; otherwise, it is 0.
   - `ans`: A string containing characters from `s` that completed sets of `k` unique characters.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print('YES')` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, or `ans` directly, the output will always be `'YES'` regardless of the values of these variables.

Output: **YES**
