The given code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `tmp`. Specifically, it sets `tmp` to the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the current value of `i`. This means if `i` is 0, `tmp` becomes `'a'`; if `i` is 1, `tmp` becomes `'b'`, and so on.

Here's the updated state of the variables after executing the code:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5.
- `n`, `k`, `m` remain the integers read from the input.
- `s` remains the string read from the input.
- `cnt` remains the number of times k distinct characters were encountered in sequence and `cnt` is less than `n`.
- `cur` remains 0 or (1 << k) - 1 depending on the last sequence.
- `ans` remains a string containing the characters that completed the sequences of k distinct characters.
- `tmp` is now set to the character `'a' + i`.
- `i` remains unchanged unless modified elsewhere in the code, but its value is used to determine the new value of `tmp`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is the string read from the input, `cnt` is the number of times k distinct characters were encountered in sequence and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0 or (1 << k) - 1 depending on the last sequence, `ans` is a string containing the characters that completed the sequences of k distinct characters, `tmp` is `'a' + i`**.
