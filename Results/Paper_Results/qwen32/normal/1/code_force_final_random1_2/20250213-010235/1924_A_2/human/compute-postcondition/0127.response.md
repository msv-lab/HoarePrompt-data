The code snippet sets the variable `cur` to 0. This means the value of `cur` changes from its previous value to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `cnt` is 1; `ans` is ''; `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` was not set and is now set to 1. `cur` is 0.**
