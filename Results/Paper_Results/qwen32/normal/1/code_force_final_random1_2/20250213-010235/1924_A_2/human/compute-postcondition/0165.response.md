To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step-by-step.

The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `k-1`. For each iteration `i`, it checks if the `i-th` bit of `cur` is 0 (using the condition `cur & 1 << i == 0`). If this condition is met, it sets `tmp` to the character corresponding to the `i-th` position in the alphabet (`chr(ord('a') + i)`) and breaks out of the loop. If the condition is not met for any `i` in the range, `tmp` remains an empty string.

Here's a summary of the key points:
- The loop runs up to `k` times.
- It stops as soon as it finds an `i` such that `cur & 1 << i == 0`.
- If no such `i` is found within the range, `tmp` remains an empty string.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that:
- After 1 iteration, `tmp` could either be 'a' (if `cur & 1 == 0`) or still an empty string.
- After 2 iterations, `tmp` could be 'b' (if `cur & 1 == 1` and `cur & 2 == 0`), 'a', or still an empty string.
- After 3 iterations, `tmp` could be 'c' (if `cur & 1 == 1`, `cur & 2 == 1`, and `cur & 4 == 0`), 'b', 'a', or still an empty string.

After all iterations, the final state of `tmp` will be determined by the first `i` where `cur & 1 << i == 0`. If no such `i` exists within the range `[0, k-1]`, `tmp` will remain an empty string.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`tmp` is set to the character 'a' + `i` where `i` is the smallest index such that `cur & 1 << i == 0`, or `tmp` remains an empty string if no such `i` exists within the range `[0, k-1]`.**

In simpler terms, `tmp` will contain the character corresponding to the first bit position in `cur` that is 0, or it will remain an empty string if all bits in the checked range are 1.
