The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` updates the value of `cur` by adding the result of the bitwise left shift operation `1 << cur_ss` to its current value. The bitwise left shift operation shifts the binary representation of `1` to the left by `cur_ss` positions, effectively calculating `2^cur_ss`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5
- `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `ss` is the next character in the string `s`
- `cur_ss` is the integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z')

After executing the code, the value of `cur` will be updated to `cur + 2^cur_ss`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is the integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'); `cur` is updated to `cur + 2^cur_ss`.**
