The code snippet `ans += tmp` appends the value of `tmp` to the string `ans`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the newly read string from the input; `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively in `s`; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete set; `ans` is the string containing characters from `s` that completed sets of `k` unique characters with `tmp` appended; `cnt` is less than `n`; `tmp` is a character between 'a' and 'z' determined by `chr(ord('a') + i)` if the `i`-th bit of `cur` was 0, otherwise `tmp` remains unchanged; `i` is the index of the first 0 bit in `cur` if the loop breaks early, or `k-1` if the loop completes all iterations.**
