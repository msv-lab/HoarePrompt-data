The given code snippet appends a certain number of `'a'` characters to the variable `ans`. Specifically, it adds `'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` characters to `ans`.

Here's the breakdown of the changes:

1. `ans` is updated by appending `'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` to its current value.

The other variables (`tmp`, `cur`, `i`, `k`, `n`, `cnt`) remain unchanged unless their values are explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, which they are not.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`tmp` is set to the character `'a' + i` where `i` is the smallest index such that `cur & 1 << i == 0`, or `tmp` remains an empty string if no such `i` exists within the range `[0, k-1]`; `ans` is updated to `ans + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`.**
