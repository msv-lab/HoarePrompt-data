You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: After all iterations, `t` remains the same, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` reflect the values of the last test case, `cnt` reflects the count of sequences of `k` distinct characters for the last test case, `cur` reflects the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence for the last test case, and `ans` contains the constructed string if `cnt < n` for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. It checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` sequences of `k` distinct characters. If it does, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string by appending a character that completes the last incomplete sequence of distinct characters and additional 'a' characters to meet the requirement of `n` sequences, then prints this constructed string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

### Issues in the Code

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Subsequences**:
   - The code attempts to count subsequences of length `k` within the string `s` using bitwise operations. However, this approach does not correctly count all possible subsequences of length `n`.
   - The variable `cur` is used to track the presence of characters in the current subsequence, but it does not ensure that the subsequences are of length `n`.

2. **Generating Missing Subsequence**:
   - The code tries to generate a missing subsequence by appending characters that were not present in the last counted subsequence. However, this logic does not guarantee that the generated subsequence is indeed missing from `s`.
   - The code appends characters in a way that might not form a valid subsequence of length `n`.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The code does not handle cases where `n` is greater than `k`, meaning some characters might not be available to form a subsequence of length `n`.
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where `n` is equal to `k` and all characters are present but not in the required order to form all possible subsequences.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails

Let's consider the following test case:

```
1
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

- **Expected Output**: `YES` (since all possible strings of length 3 using 'a', 'b', 'c' can be formed as subsequences).
- **Actual Output**: `NO` followed by some string (incorrect).

### Explanation of Failure

- The code incorrectly counts subsequences of length `k` (which is 3 in this case) and checks if the count is greater than or equal to `n` (which is also 3). However, it does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length 3 are present.
- The generated missing subsequence is not guaranteed to be correct.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to check for all possible subsequences of length `n` and generate a missing subsequence if needed. Therefore, the correctness of the program is `False`.
