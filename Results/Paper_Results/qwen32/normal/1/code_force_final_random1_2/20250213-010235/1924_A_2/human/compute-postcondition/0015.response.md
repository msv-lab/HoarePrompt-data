The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the value of `ss` to the `ans` string. Given the initial state, `ans` was an empty string, and after the operation, `ans` will contain the value of `ss`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `cnt` is 1; `ans` is `ss`; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`; `cur` is 0.**

In natural language: The variable `ans` now holds the value of `ss`. All other variables retain their initial values.
