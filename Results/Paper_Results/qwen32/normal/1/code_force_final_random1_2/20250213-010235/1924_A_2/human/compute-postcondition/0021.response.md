Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the zero-based index of `ss` in the alphabet; `cnt` is 1; `ans` is an empty string. If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
