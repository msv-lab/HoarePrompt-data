The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the value of `ss` to the existing value of `ans`. Since the initial state does not specify what `ss` is, we will denote the new value of `ans` as the concatenation of its previous value (which is an empty string) and `ss`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `cnt` is 1; `ans` is `ss`; `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` was not set and is now set to 1. `cur` is 0.**
This means that `ans` now holds the value of `ss`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
