The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the variable `cur` by the value of `1` left-shifted by `cur_ss` bits. This effectively sets the bit at position `cur_ss` in the binary representation of `cur` to `1`.

Given the initial state, `cur` was initially `0`. After executing the code, `cur` will have its `cur_ss`-th bit set to `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25, and the bitwise AND of `cur` and `1 << cur_ss` is `1 << cur_ss`.**
