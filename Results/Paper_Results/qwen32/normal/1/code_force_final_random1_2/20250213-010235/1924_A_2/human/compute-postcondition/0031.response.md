The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the current character `ss` to the string `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is the integer value representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'); `cur` is 0; `cnt` is incremented by 1; `ans` is updated to include `ss`.**
