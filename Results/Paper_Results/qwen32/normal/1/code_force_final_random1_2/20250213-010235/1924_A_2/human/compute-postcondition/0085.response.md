Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `ss`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur | (1 << cur_ss)`. `cnt` is 1 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` is 0. `ans` is `s` if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `ans` is an empty string.**
