Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    ans = ''
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
            ans += ss
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                break
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the string read from the input; `cnt` is the number of times k distinct characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 or (1 << k) - 1 depending on the last sequence; `ans` is a string containing the characters that completed the sequences of k distinct characters. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, no further changes are made to `ans`. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is extended by `tmp` followed by `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters, where `tmp` is either an empty string or the character `'a' + i` with `i` being the smallest index such that `(cur & 1 << i == 0)` within the range `[0, k-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the newly read string from the input; `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively in `s`; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete set; `ans` is the string containing characters from `s` that completed sets of `k` unique characters. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, no additional changes are made to `ans`. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` has `tmp` appended plus 'a' repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times, where `tmp` is a character determined by the first 0 bit in `cur` or 'a' + `i` if the loop breaks early.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cnt` and `n` are integers. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program does nothing further regarding `tmp` and `ans`. Otherwise, `tmp` is set to the character `'a' + i` where `i` is the smallest index such that `cur & 1 << i == 0`, or `tmp` remains an empty string if no such `i` exists within the range `[0, k-1]`. Additionally, `ans` is updated to `ans + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` if `tmp` is not set to an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
