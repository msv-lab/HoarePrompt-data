Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. The integers satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The string `s` has a length of `m` and consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
