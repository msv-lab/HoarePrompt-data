The given code snippet updates the value of `cur_ss` based on the current character `ss` in the string `s`. The new value of `cur_ss` is calculated as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. This means `cur_ss` now holds the zero-based index of the character `ss` in the alphabet.

Since the code only modifies `cur_ss` and does not affect other variables, the other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `ss`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is updated based on the condition `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, `cnt` is 1 if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `s` if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `ans` is an empty string.**
