Given the initial state described, we have several variables and conditions defined:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^5.
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `s` is a string read from the input.
- `cnt` is the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was encountered in `s`, and it is specified that `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.
- `cur` is either 0 or (1 << k) - 1, depending on the last sequence of characters encountered.
- `ans` is a string containing the characters that completed the sequences of `k` distinct characters.

However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of any other variables or conditions in the initial state. The value `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
