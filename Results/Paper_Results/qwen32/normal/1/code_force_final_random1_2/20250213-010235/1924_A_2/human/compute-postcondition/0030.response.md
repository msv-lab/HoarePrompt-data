The given code snippet resets the variable `cur` to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string read from the input; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is the integer value representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'); `cur` is 0; `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
