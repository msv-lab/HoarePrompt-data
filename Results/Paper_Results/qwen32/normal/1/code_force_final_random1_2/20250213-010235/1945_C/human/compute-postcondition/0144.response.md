Output State: **`final` is either `[0]` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n` before this line) is greater than or equal to 50, or `[n]` if `c1` is less than 50; `c1` remains as `o * 100 // n` (using the old `n` value); `_` is incremented by 1; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the user input; `pk` is `n / 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `pk` is now `n / 2`. All other variables retain their previous states and values.
