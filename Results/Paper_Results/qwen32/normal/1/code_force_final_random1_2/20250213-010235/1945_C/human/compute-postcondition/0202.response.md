The given code snippet reassigns the value of `c1` using the expression `o * 100 // n`. Since the initial state specifies that `c1` was previously defined as `o * 100 // n`, executing this line does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`final` is an empty list; `c1` remains `o * 100 // n`; `_` is incremented by the length of `lst`; `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, and `mini` remain unchanged.**
