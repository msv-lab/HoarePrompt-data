The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to the integer conversion of the user's input. This changes the value of `n` but does not affect the other variables directly.

Given the initial state, `final` is either `[0]` or `[n]` based on the condition of `c1`, and `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`. Since `n` is being reassigned here, the value of `c1` will be recalculated in subsequent code executions using this new value of `n`. However, since the recalculated `c1` is not used in this snippet, `final` retains its initial form. The variable `_` is incremented by 1, so its value increases by 1.

Output State: **`final` is either `[0]` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n` before this line) is greater than or equal to 50, or `[n]` if `c1` is less than 50; `c1` remains as `o * 100 // n` (using the old `n` value); `_` is incremented by 1; `n` is the input integer.**
