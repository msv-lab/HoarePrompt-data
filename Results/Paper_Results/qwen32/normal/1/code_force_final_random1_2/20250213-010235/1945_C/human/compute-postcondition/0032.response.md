The code snippet appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. This means that the list `lst` will now include the new element `i + 1`.

Given the initial state, the value of `i` is incremented by 1 before the code snippet is executed, so `i + 1` reflects the updated value of `i` after the increment.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the value of the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, and `(n // 2) + 1` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` plus 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it remains unchanged; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` plus 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` (and possibly other elements from previous iterations); `mini` is 100000000; the current character `s[i]` is such that `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', and 0 otherwise; `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', and 0 otherwise; `i` is incremented by 1; `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**
