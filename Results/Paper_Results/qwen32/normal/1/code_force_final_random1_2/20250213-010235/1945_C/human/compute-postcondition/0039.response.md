Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to determine the new value of `one_perc` after the execution of the line `one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.

Let's break down the calculation:

- `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` plus 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it remains unchanged.
- `one` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '1', and 0 otherwise.
- `i` is 4.
- `n` is at least 2.

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 4.
- `n` is at least 2, so `(n - i - 1)` is `(n - 5)`.

Thus, the new value of `one_perc` is calculated as:
\[ \text{one\_perc} = (\text{o} - \text{one}) * 100 // (n - 5) \]

Since the exact values of `o` and `one` are not specified, we'll keep them as they are in the output state.

The other variables (`t`, `a`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `z`, `lst`, `mini`, `zero`, `zero_perc`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'; `s` is the value of the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, and `(n // 2) + 1` if `n` is odd; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` plus 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it remains unchanged; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` plus 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` (which is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`) is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` (which is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`) is greater than or equal to 50; otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged; `mini` is 100000000; the current character `s[i]` is such that `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', and 0 otherwise; `one` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '1', and 0 otherwise; `i` is 4; `zero_perc` is either 0 or 20; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 5)`**
