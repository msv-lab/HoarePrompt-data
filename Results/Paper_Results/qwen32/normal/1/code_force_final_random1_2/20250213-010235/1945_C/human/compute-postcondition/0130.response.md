To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `final` list based on the given conditions.

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element in the `lst`.
- For each `elem` in `lst`, it checks if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.
- If the condition is true, `elem` is appended to the `final` list.
- The loop runs as many times as there are elements in `lst`.

### Given Information:
- Initial `lst` is `[0]`.
- After the first iteration (`lst` was `[0]`), `final` could be `[0]` if `abs(pk - 0) == mini`, or `[]` otherwise.
- After the second iteration (`lst` was `[0, 1]`), `final` could be `[0, 0]`, `[0, 1]`, or `[1]` depending on whether `abs(pk - 0) == mini` and `abs(pk - 1) == mini`.
- After the third iteration (`lst` was `[0, 1]` and `elem` was `1`), `final` could be `[1, 1, 1]`, `[1, 1]`, or `[1]` depending on whether `abs(pk - 1) == mini`.

### Observations:
- The loop only runs as many times as there are elements in `lst`.
- From the provided information, it seems that `lst` has only two elements `[0, 1]` and the loop runs exactly twice with these elements.
- Since the third iteration description implies `lst` is still `[0, 1]` and `elem` is `1`, it suggests that the loop does not add more elements to `lst` dynamically during its execution.

### Conclusion:
Given that `lst` contains only `[0, 1]`, the loop will run exactly twice. Therefore, the final state of `final` will depend on the values of `pk` and `mini`.

### Possible Final States:
- If `abs(pk - 0) == mini` and `abs(pk - 1) == mini`, then `final` will be `[0, 1]`.
- If `abs(pk - 0) == mini` and `abs(pk - 1) != mini`, then `final` will be `[0]`.
- If `abs(pk - 0) != mini` and `abs(pk - 1) == mini`, then `final` will be `[1]`.
- If `abs(pk - 0) != mini` and `abs(pk - 1) != mini`, then `final` will be `[]`.

Since the exact values of `pk` and `mini` are not provided, we cannot definitively determine which of these cases holds. However, based on the pattern observed in the iterations, the most likely scenario is that `final` will contain the elements from `lst` for which the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini` holds true.

Given the provided information, the most consistent state after the loop finishes executing all iterations (with `lst` being `[0, 1]`) is:

Output State: **[0, 1]**.

This means that both `0` and `1` satisfy the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.
