The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to be the integer conversion of whatever is input by the user. This does not affect any of the other variables (`mini`, `final`, `pk`, `lst`, `c1`, `o`, `t`) directly. The only change is that `n` now holds the value of the user's input converted to an integer.

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. If `len(final) == 0`, then if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing one element, `[0]`. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing `n`. `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `len(final) != 0`, then `final` remains a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. `t` is decremented by 1. `n` is an input integer.**
