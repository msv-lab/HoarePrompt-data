The code snippet `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Given the initial state, `final` could either be `[elem]` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini` or `[]` otherwise. After appending `elem`, `final` will definitely contain `elem`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`final` is `[elem]` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini` initially, otherwise `final` is `[elem]`; `c1` remains as `o * 100 // n`; `_` is incremented by 1; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the user input; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0' in `sl`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` contains at least two elements; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `elem` is the next element in `lst`.**

In simpler terms, `final` now definitely includes `elem`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
