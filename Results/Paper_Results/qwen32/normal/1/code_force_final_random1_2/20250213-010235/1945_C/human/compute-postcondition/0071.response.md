Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed by the `print(final[0])` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`mini` Calculation**:
   - `mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`.
   - This means `mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`.

2. **`final` List Initialization**:
   - If `len(final) == 0`:
     - If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` becomes a list containing one element, `[0]`.
     - Otherwise, `final` becomes a list containing `n`.
   - If `len(final) != 0`:
     - `final` remains a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.

3. **`c1` Calculation**:
   - `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.
   - Here, `o` and `n` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but they influence the value of `c1`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:

- The statement `print(final[0])` will print the first element of the `final` list.
- To determine what `final[0]` is, we need to consider the conditions under which `final` is initialized or modified.

### Conditions:

1. **When `len(final) == 0`**:
   - If `c1 >= 50`, `final` is set to `[0]`. Therefore, `final[0]` would be `0`.
   - If `c1 < 50`, `final` is set to `[n]`. Therefore, `final[0]` would be `n`.

2. **When `len(final) != 0`**:
   - `final` contains elements from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.
   - Since `final` is sorted, `final[0]` would be the smallest element in `lst` that satisfies `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.

### Conclusion:

Given the initial state, the value of `final[0]` depends on the length of `final` and the conditions specified:

- If `final` was initially empty and `c1 >= 50`, `final[0]` is `0`.
- If `final` was initially empty and `c1 < 50`, `final[0]` is `n`.
- If `final` was not empty, `final[0]` is the smallest element in `lst` that satisfies `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.

Since the exact values of `c1`, `n`, `pk`, and `lst` are not provided, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `final[0]` in all cases. However, based on the conditions described, we can provide a precise description.

### Final Output:

Output: **final[0] (where final[0] is 0 if len(final) == 0 and c1 >= 50, n if len(final) == 0 and c1 < 50, or the smallest element in lst that satisfies abs(pk - elem) == mini if len(final) != 0)**
