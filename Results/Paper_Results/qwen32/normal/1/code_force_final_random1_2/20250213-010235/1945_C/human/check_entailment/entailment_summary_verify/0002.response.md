### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Objective**: Find the position \( i \) to place the road such that:
   - At least half of the residents on the left side want to live on the left (\(\lceil \frac{i}{2} \rceil\) zeros).
   - At least half of the residents on the right side want to live on the right (\(\lceil \frac{n-i}{2} \rceil\) ones).
   - Among all valid positions, choose the one closest to the middle (\(\left| \frac{n}{2} - i \right|\)).

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The road can be placed before the first house (\(i=0\)).
   - The road can be placed after the last house (\(i=n\)).

#### Issues Identified in the Provided Code:
1. **Percentage Calculation**:
   - The code calculates percentages using integer division, which can lead to incorrect results. Instead, the code should directly compare counts to the required thresholds.

2. **Threshold Comparison**:
   - The code should check if the counts of '0's and '1's meet the required thresholds:
     - Left side: `zero >= math.ceil(i / 2)`
     - Right side: `one >= math.ceil((n - i) / 2)`

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code should explicitly check if placing the road before the first house or after the last house satisfies the conditions.

4. **Optimal Position Selection**:
   - The code should find the position that minimizes \(\left| \frac{n}{2} - i \right|\) and, in case of ties, select the smaller \( i \).

#### Revised Analysis of the Code:
Let's go through the code step-by-step and identify specific issues:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pk` is calculated as `n / 2`, which is correct for determining the midpoint.
   - `o` and `z` are counts of '1's and '0's, respectively, but these are not used correctly later.

2. **Iterating Through Possible Road Positions**:
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`, which is correct.
   - `zero` and `one` are updated correctly.
   - Percentage calculations (`zero_perc` and `one_perc`) are incorrect due to integer division and do not match the problem's requirements.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The conditions `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` are incorrect. Instead, the code should check:
     - `zero >= math.ceil(i / 2)`
     - `one >= math.ceil((n - i) / 2)`

4. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - The code attempts to find the position that minimizes the absolute difference from `pk`, but the logic is flawed due to incorrect threshold checks.
   - The code should also handle edge cases explicitly.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code should check if placing the road before the first house or after the last house satisfies the conditions.

### Corrected Approach:
- Use direct comparison of counts to thresholds.
- Handle edge cases explicitly.
- Ensure the optimal position is selected correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the percentage calculation and threshold checks, the provided program is not correct. It may produce incorrect results due to these flaws.

**Final: False**

The program needs to be revised to correctly calculate the required conditions and handle edge cases accurately.
