The code snippet provided calculates the value of `c1` using the formula `o * 100 // n`. This operation does not affect the variables `mini` and `final` since they are not used in the calculation of `c1`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.

Given that `mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst` and `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, and the current value of `final` is an empty list, these conditions persist after the execution of the code snippet.

The new variable `c1` is introduced and assigned the value of `o * 100 // n`.

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is an empty list; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`.**
