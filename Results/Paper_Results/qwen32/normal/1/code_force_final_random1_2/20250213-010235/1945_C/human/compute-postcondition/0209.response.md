To determine the output of the `print(final[0])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `final` is sorted in ascending order.
   - If `len(final) == 0`, then `final` becomes a list containing either `[0]` if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, or `[n]` if `c1` is less than 50.
   - `c1` is defined as `o * 100 // n`.
   - Other variables (`n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, and `mini`) remain unchanged and are not directly relevant to the value of `final`.

2. **Key Points**:
   - Since `final` is sorted in ascending order, the first element `final[0]` would be the smallest element in the list.
   - If `final` is empty (`len(final) == 0`), it gets reassigned to either `[0]` or `[n]` based on the value of `c1`.

3. **Determining the Value of `final[0]`**:
   - If `final` was not initially empty, `final[0]` is simply the smallest element in the sorted list.
   - If `final` was empty, it gets reassigned to either `[0]` or `[n]`:
     - If `c1 >= 50`, `final` becomes `[0]`, so `final[0]` would be `0`.
     - If `c1 < 50`, `final` becomes `[n]`, so `final[0]` would be `n`.

Given these points, the output of `print(final[0])` depends on whether `final` was initially empty or not, and if it was empty, the value of `c1`.

### Output Description:
- If `final` was not empty, it prints the smallest element in the sorted list `final`.
- If `final` was empty and `c1 >= 50`, it prints `0`.
- If `final` was empty and `c1 < 50`, it prints `n`.

Since the exact values of `final`, `c1`, and `n` are not provided, we can't determine a specific numerical value. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions.

Output: **final[0] (where final[0] is the smallest element in the sorted list `final` if `final` is not empty; otherwise, it is `0` if `c1 >= 50`, or `n` if `c1 < 50)**
