To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the given information and the behavior of the loop.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `mini` is 100000000.
   - `final` is a list containing `n` (or `[0]` if `len(final) == 0` and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50).
   - `c1` is `o * 100 // n`.
   - `t` is decremented by 1.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `pk` is `n / 2`.
   - `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`.
   - `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`.
   - `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`.
   - `zero` is the total count of '0's encountered up to the second last character.
   - `one` is the total count of '1's encountered up to the second last character.
   - `lst` contains all indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were greater than or equal to 50 during the iterations.

2. **Loop Code:**
   ```python
   for ele in lst:
       mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
   ```

3. **Output States After Iterations:**
   - **After 1 iteration:** `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and `abs(pk - ele)`.
   - **After 2 iterations:** Same as after 1 iteration since `lst` remains `[0]`.
   - **After 3 iterations:** `mini` is the minimum of 100000000, `abs(pk - 0)`, and `abs(pk - ele)`.

### Conclusion:
From the above observations, it is clear that `lst` contains only one element `[0]`. Therefore, the loop will only iterate once regardless of the number of iterations specified in the problem statement. The value of `mini` will be updated based on the single element in `lst`.

### Final Output State:
- `mini` will be the minimum of 100000000 and `abs(pk - 0)`, which simplifies to `min(100000000, pk)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

### Calculation:
- `pk` is `n / 2`.
- Therefore, `mini` will be `min(100000000, n / 2)`.

### Final Output:
Output State: **mini is min(100000000, n / 2), final is a list containing n (or [0] if len(final) == 0 and c1 is greater than or equal to 50), c1 is o * 100 // n, t is decremented by 1, n is the input integer, s is the input string, pk is n / 2, sl is a list of characters from the string s, o is the count of '1's in the string s, z is the count of '0's in the string s, zero is the total count of '0's encountered up to the second last character, one is the total count of '1's encountered up to the second last character, lst is [0].**

In simple terms, `mini` will be the smaller value between 100000000 and half of the input integer `n`. All other variables retain their initial values or calculations as described.
