The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `lst`. If there are more elements in `lst`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `elem` was the last element processed from `lst`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `lst` to be processed. Therefore, `elem` should be set to the next element in `lst`.

Since we don't know the specific elements of `lst` or the current position of `elem` within it, we can only say that `elem` should be the next element in the sequence.

State: **`mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a list containing `elem` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, otherwise `final` remains an empty list; `lst` has at least one element; `elem` is the next element in `lst`**
