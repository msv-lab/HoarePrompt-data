The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the original value of `n` (which was an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) is overwritten by the new input value.

The variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'**.
