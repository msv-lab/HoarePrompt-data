Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`final`**: 
   - If `len(final)` was initially 0, then:
     - `final` becomes `[0]` if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.
     - `final` becomes `[n]` if `c1` is less than 50.
   - If `len(final)` was initially not 0, then `final` remains `[0, 1]`.

2. **`c1`**: 
   - `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.

### Given Code Snippet:
```python
print(final[0])
```

### Analysis:
- We need to determine the value of `final[0]` based on the conditions provided.
- Since the initial length of `final` is not specified, we'll consider both scenarios:
  - **Scenario 1**: `len(final)` was initially 0.
    - In this case, `final` is set based on the value of `c1`.
    - If `c1 >= 50`, `final` becomes `[0]`, so `final[0]` would be `0`.
    - If `c1 < 50`, `final` becomes `[n]`, so `final[0]` would be `n`.
  - **Scenario 2**: `len(final)` was initially not 0.
    - In this case, `final` remains `[0, 1]`, so `final[0]` would be `0`.

### Conclusion:
- If `len(final)` was initially 0:
  - `final[0]` could be `0` if `c1 >= 50`.
  - `final[0]` could be `n` if `c1 < 50`.
- If `len(final)` was initially not 0:
  - `final[0]` is `0`.

Given the ambiguity about the initial length of `final`, we can describe the output in terms of the possible values of `final[0]`:

### Final Output:
Output: **0 or n (where 0 is used if len(final) was initially not 0 or if c1 >= 50, and n is used if len(final) was initially 0 and c1 < 50)**
