The code appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. The values of `mini`, `c1`, and `lst` remain unchanged. Since `final` was initially an empty list, after appending `n`, it will contain one element, which is `n`.

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a list containing `n`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and `c1` is less than 50.**
