Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `final` is either `[0]` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n` before this line) is greater than or equal to 50, or `[n]` if `c1` is less than 50; `c1` remains as `o * 100 // n` (using the old `n` value); `_` is incremented by 1; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the user input; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0' in `sl`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list; `mini` is `100000000`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `final` is either `[0]` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n` before this line) is greater than or equal to 50, or `[n]` if `c1` is less than 50; `c1` remains as `o * 100 // n` (using the old `n` value); `_` is incremented by 1; `n` must be at least 2; `s` is the user input; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0' in `sl`; `zero` is 1 if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0; `one` is 0 if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `one` is 1; `lst` is `[1]` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list; `mini` is `100000000`; `i` is 0; `zero_perc` is 100 if the first character of `s` is '0', otherwise `zero_perc` is 0; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `final` is either `[0]` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n` before this line) is greater than or equal to 50, or `[n]` if `c1` is less than 50; `c1` remains as `o * 100 // n` (using the old `n` value); `_` is incremented by 1; `n` must be at least 2; `s` is the user input; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0' in `sl`; `zero` is 1 if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0; `one` is 1 if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '1', otherwise `one` is 0; `lst` is `[2]` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list; `mini` is `100000000`; `i` is 1; `zero_perc` is `50` if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `zero_perc` is `0`; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `final` is either `[0]` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n` before this line) is greater than or equal to 50, or `[n]` if `c1` is less than 50; `c1` remains as `o * 100 // n` (using the old `n` value); `_` is incremented by 1; `n` must be at least 2; `s` is the user input; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`; `z` is the count of '0' in `sl`; `zero` is 2 if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 1; `one` is 1 more than its previous value if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '1'; `lst` is `[2, 3]` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` is `[2]`; `mini` is `100000000`; `i` is 2; `zero_perc` is 66 if the current character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `zero_perc` is 33; `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
