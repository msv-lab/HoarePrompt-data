The code sorts the list `final`. Since `final` initially contains all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, sorting `final` will arrange these elements in ascending order. The values of `mini` and the contents of `lst` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mini` is the smallest value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**
