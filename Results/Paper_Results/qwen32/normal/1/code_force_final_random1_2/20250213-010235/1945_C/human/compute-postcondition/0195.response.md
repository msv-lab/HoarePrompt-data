Postcondition: **`final` is `[elem]` if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`; otherwise, `final` remains `[]`. `c1` remains as `o * 100 // n`. `_` is incremented by 1. `n` is the input integer. `s` is the user input. `pk` is `n / 2`. `sl` is a list of characters from `s`. `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`. `z` is the count of '0' in `sl`. `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`. `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`. `lst` contains at least two elements. `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. `elem` is the next element in `lst`.**
