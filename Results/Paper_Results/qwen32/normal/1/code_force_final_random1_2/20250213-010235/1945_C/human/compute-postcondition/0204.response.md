The code appends the integer `0` to the list `final`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`final` is a list containing one element `[0]`; `c1` is an integer greater than or equal to 50, where `c1` remains `o * 100 // n`; `_` is incremented by the length of `lst`; `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, and `mini` remain unchanged.**
