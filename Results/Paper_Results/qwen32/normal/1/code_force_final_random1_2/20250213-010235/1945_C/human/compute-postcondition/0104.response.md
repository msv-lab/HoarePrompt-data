The code snippet increments the variable `zero` by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is incremented by 1, which means `i` had some value before and now it has that value plus one. However, the code does not affect `i`. The variable `zero` is incremented by 1, so its new value is its previous value plus one.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `zero` is incremented by 1**.
