The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it determines the earliest position where the percentage of '0's up to that position and the percentage of '1's from that position onward are both at least 50%. If no such position exists, it returns either the start or end of the string based on which character ('0' or '1') has a majority in the entire string.
