Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (This variable does not affect the current print statement).
- `n` is the integer input by the user, representing the number of integers in the list.
- The list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` contains at least one `a_i` equal to 1.
- `arr` is a string formed by concatenating the input line with all whitespace removed.
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
- `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
- `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` up to, but not including, index `n - y`.

### Code Analysis:
```python
print(z.count('0'))
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Forming `arr`:**
   - `arr` is a string created by removing all whitespace from the input line of `n` integers.
   - For example, if the input line is `"1 0 1 0 1"`, then `arr` becomes `"10101"`.

2. **Finding `x` and `y`:**
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
   - `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
   - Continuing with the example, `x` would be `0` (first '1') and `y` would be `4` (last '1').

3. **Creating `z`:**
   - `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` up to, but not including, index `n - y`.
   - In our example, `n` is `5` (since there are 5 characters in `"10101"`), so `n - y` is `5 - 4 = 1`.
   - Therefore, `z` is the substring from index `0` up to, but not including, index `1`, which results in `z` being `"1"`.

4. **Counting '0's in `z`:**
   - The `count('0')` method counts the number of occurrences of '0' in the string `z`.
   - Since `z` is `"1"`, it contains no '0's.

### Conclusion:
The `print(z.count('0'))` statement will print the number of '0's in the substring `z`.

Given the above steps, the output will be:
Output: **0**
