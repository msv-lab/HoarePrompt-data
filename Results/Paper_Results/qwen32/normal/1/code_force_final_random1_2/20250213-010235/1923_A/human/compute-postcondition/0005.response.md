The code snippet `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` reverses the string `arr` and finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string. Since `arr` is formed by concatenating the input line with all whitespace removed and contains at least one '1', reversing `arr` will also contain at least one '1'. The index `y` will be the position of the first '1' in this reversed string.

Given that `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original string `arr`, `y` will be the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the original string `arr` because reversing the string flips the positions of characters.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the integer input by the user, and the list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` contains at least one `a_i` equal to 1; `arr` is a string formed by concatenating the input line with all whitespace removed; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`; `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`.**
