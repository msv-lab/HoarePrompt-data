Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to move chips so that they form a contiguous block without any free cells between them. The operations involve moving chips to the closest free cell to their left.

### Key Points:
- We need to identify the leftmost and rightmost chips.
- All chips need to be moved into a contiguous block starting from the leftmost free cell up to the rightmost chip's position.
- The number of operations needed is equal to the number of free cells within the span from the leftmost chip to the rightmost chip.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code and see if it follows the correct logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())  # Read the array and remove spaces
        x = arr.find('1')  # Find the index of the first '1' (leftmost chip)
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')  # Find the index of the first '1' from the end (rightmost chip)
        z = arr[x:n - y]  # Slice the array from the leftmost chip to the rightmost chip
        print(z.count('0'))  # Count the number of '0's in this slice
```

#### Issues with the Code:
1. **Incorrect Slicing**: The slicing `arr[x:n - y]` is incorrect. `n - y` does not give the correct ending index for the slice. Instead, it should be `n - y - 1` because `y` is the distance from the end, not the actual index.
2. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle cases where there are no free cells between the leftmost and rightmost chips correctly. It will still count zeros even if they are not within the span of the chips.

### Correct Approach:
1. Identify the leftmost (`x`) and rightmost (`n - y - 1`) indices of the chips.
2. Count the number of free cells (`0`s) within the span `[x, n - y - 1]`.

### Corrected Code:
Here's how the corrected code would look like:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())  # Read the array and remove spaces
        x = arr.find('1')  # Find the index of the first '1' (leftmost chip)
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')  # Find the index of the first '1' from the end (rightmost chip)
        z = arr[x:n - y]  # Correctly slice the array from the leftmost chip to the rightmost chip
        print(z.count('0'))  # Count the number of '0's in this slice

# Note: The slicing should actually be arr[x:n - y - 1 + 1] which simplifies to arr[x:n - y]
```

However, the original code has an off-by-one error in the slicing part, which makes it incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the original program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required.

Correctness: **False**
