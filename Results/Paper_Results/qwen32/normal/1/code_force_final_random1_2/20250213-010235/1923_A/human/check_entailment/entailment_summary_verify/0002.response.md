### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
The goal is to move chips so that they form a contiguous block without any free cells between them. The number of operations required is the number of free cells within the span from the leftmost chip to the rightmost chip.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())  # Read the array and remove spaces
        x = arr.find('1')  # Find the index of the first '1' (leftmost chip)
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')  # Find the index of the first '1' from the end (rightmost chip)
        z = arr[x:n - y]  # Slice the array from the leftmost chip to the rightmost chip
        print(z.count('0'))  # Count the number of '0's in this slice
```

#### Function Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of binary integers (0s and 1s). For each test case, it calculates the number of 0s between the first and last occurrence of the integer 1 in the list and prints this count.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the configuration of the ribbon as a string of 0s and 1s.

2. **Finding Indices:**
   - `x = arr.find('1')`: This correctly finds the index of the leftmost chip.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: This finds the index of the rightmost chip when viewed from the end of the string. However, `y` is the distance from the end, not the actual index.

3. **Slicing the Array:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]`: This slice is intended to capture the segment from the leftmost chip to the rightmost chip. However, `n - y` is incorrect. The correct ending index should be `n - y - 1` because `y` is the distance from the end, not the index.

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - `print(z.count('0'))`: This counts the number of free cells within the sliced segment.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Off-by-One Error in Slicing:** The slicing `arr[x:n - y]` is incorrect. It should be `arr[x:n - y - 1 + 1]` which simplifies to `arr[x:n - y]`. However, this is still incorrect because `y` is the distance from the end, not the index. The correct slicing should be `arr[x:n - y]` but `y` needs to be adjusted properly.
- **Handling Edge Cases:** The code does not handle cases where there are no free cells between the leftmost and rightmost chips correctly.

#### Corrected Approach:
1. Identify the leftmost (`x`) and rightmost (`n - y - 1`) indices of the chips.
2. Count the number of free cells (`0`s) within the span `[x, n - y - 1]`.

#### Corrected Code:
Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())  # Read the array and remove spaces
        x = arr.find('1')  # Find the index of the first '1' (leftmost chip)
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')  # Find the index of the first '1' from the end (rightmost chip)
        z = arr[x:n - y]  # Correctly slice the array from the leftmost chip to the rightmost chip
        print(z.count('0'))  # Count the number of '0's in this slice

# Note: The slicing should actually be arr[x:n - y - 1 + 1] which simplifies to arr[x:n - y]
```

However, the slicing `arr[x:n - y]` is still incorrect due to the off-by-one error. The correct slicing should be `arr[x:n - y - 1 + 1]` which simplifies to `arr[x:n - y]` but `y` needs to be adjusted properly.

#### Final Evaluation:
Given the issues identified, the original program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required.

### Final: **False**
