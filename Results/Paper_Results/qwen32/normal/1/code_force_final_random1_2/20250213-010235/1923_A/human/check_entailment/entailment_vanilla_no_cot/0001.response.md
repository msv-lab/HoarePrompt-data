Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to move chips in a ribbon such that they form a contiguous block with no free cells between them. The objective is to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve this configuration. An operation involves moving a chip to the closest free cell to its left.

### Key Points
- We need to identify the leftmost and rightmost chips.
- The goal is to move all chips between these two positions, filling all free cells in between.
- The number of operations required is equal to the number of free cells within the span of the leftmost and rightmost chips.

### Code Analysis
Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')          # Find the index of the first '1' (leftmost chip)
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')      # Find the index of the first '1' in the reversed array (rightmost chip)
        z = arr[x:n - y]           # Extract the substring from the leftmost to the rightmost chip
        print(z.count('0'))        # Count the number of '0's in this substring (free cells)
```

#### Issues in the Code
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Rightmost Chip Index:**
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the position of the first '1' in the reversed string, which corresponds to the distance from the end of the string to the rightmost '1'. However, this value needs to be converted back to the original indexing to get the actual position of the rightmost '1'.
   - The correct calculation should be `n - y - 1`.

2. **Substring Extraction:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` is incorrect because `n - y` does not represent the correct index of the rightmost chip.
   - It should be `z = arr[x:n - y]` corrected to `z = arr[x:n - y - 1 + 1]` or simply `z = arr[x:n - y]` corrected to `z = arr[x:n - y + 1]`.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')          # Find the index of the first '1' (leftmost chip)
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')      # Find the index of the first '1' in the reversed array (distance from the end)
        rightmost_index = n - y - 1  # Convert this to the actual index of the rightmost '1'
        z = arr[x:rightmost_index + 1]  # Extract the substring from the leftmost to the rightmost chip
        print(z.count('0'))        # Count the number of '0's in this substring (free cells)
```

### Conclusion
The original code is incorrect due to the improper calculation of the rightmost chip's index and the subsequent substring extraction.

**Correctness: False**
