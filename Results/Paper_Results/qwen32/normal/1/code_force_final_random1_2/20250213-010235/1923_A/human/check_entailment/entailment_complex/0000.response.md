### Reasoning:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by finding the number of operations required to move all chips into a contiguous block. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Details**: For each test case, it reads the number of cells (`n`) and the configuration of the ribbon (`arr`), which is a string of '0's and '1's representing free cells and cells with chips, respectively.
3. **Finding First and Last Chip Positions**:
   - `x = arr.find('1')`: This finds the index of the first '1' (chip) in the array.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: This finds the index of the first '1' in the reversed array, which corresponds to the last '1' in the original array.
4. **Counting Operations**:
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]`: This slices the array from the first chip to the position just before the last chip.
   - `print(z.count('0'))`: It counts the number of '0's in this slice, which represents the number of free cells between the first and last chip. This count is printed as the result for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic seems correct because the number of operations needed to move all chips into a contiguous block is indeed the number of free cells ('0's) between the first and last chip.
- The slicing and counting operations are performed correctly to achieve this.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The code correctly identifies the first and last positions of the chips and counts the number of free cells between them, which gives the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a contiguous block.
Correctness: **True**
