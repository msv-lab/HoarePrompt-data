The given code snippet modifies the variable `y` by finding the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr`. Here's the impact on the variables:

- `y` is reassigned to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`.

Since `y` was originally the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the original `arr`, after reversing `arr`, the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string corresponds to the length of `arr` minus the original `y` minus 1.

Thus, the new value of `y` is calculated as `len(arr) - y - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t < 1000, `n` is the new integer input by the user, the list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` contains at least one `a_i` equal to 1, `arr` is a string formed by concatenating the new input line with all whitespace removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the original `arr`, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` (which is `len(arr) - y - 1`), `z` is the substring of the original `arr` from index `x` up to, but not including, index `n - y`.**
