To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m
```

Given the current state:
- `n` must be at least 12.
- `m` must be at least 10.
- `x` is 3.
- `y` is 3.
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is increased by 0.8 (though `cnt` is not part of the loop condition).

Let's evaluate the expressions `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y` with the current values of `x` and `y`:
- `(x + y) * x = (3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18`
- `(x + y) * y = (3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18`

With these calculations:
- `(x + y) * x = 18` should be `<= n` (which must be at least 12).
- `(x + y) * y = 18` should be `<= m` (which must be at least 10).

Since 18 is not less than or equal to 10, the loop condition `(x + y) * y <= m` fails, and thus the loop cannot execute with the current values of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` and `m` so that both conditions are satisfied:
- `n` should be at least 18.
- `m` should be at least 18.

No changes are needed for `x` and `y` since they are already set to 3, and their GCD is 1, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` must be at least 18, `m` must be at least 18, `x` is 3, `y` is 3, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1**
