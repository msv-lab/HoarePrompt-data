To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` evaluates to `True`.

Given:
- `n` must be at least 9.
- `m` is an integer.
- `x` is 3.
- `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is the number of valid pairs `(2, y)` where `gcd(2, y) == 1` and the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` hold.

Let's evaluate the condition `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` with the current values of `x` and `y`:

1. Calculate `(x + y) * x`:
   \[
   (x + y) * x = (3 + 1) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12
   \]
   Since `n` must be at least 9, this part of the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` would be satisfied if `n` were at least 12.

2. Calculate `(x + y) * y`:
   \[
   (x + y) * y = (3 + 1) * 1 = 4 * 1 = 4
   \]
   For this part of the condition `(x + y) * y <= m` to be satisfied, `m` must be at least 4.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 12 and `m` to be at least 4.

State: **`n` must be at least 12, `m` must be at least 4, `x` is 3, `y` is 1**
