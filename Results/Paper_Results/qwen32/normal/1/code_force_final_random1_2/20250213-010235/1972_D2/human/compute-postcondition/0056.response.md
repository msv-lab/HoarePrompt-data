It appears there's a slight discrepancy in the provided example since the function `func_1()` does not accept any parameters according to the given definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, I'll assume the function should accept two parameters `n` and `m`. Here's the corrected description:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. It returns a specific value or performs a specific operation based on these inputs, but the exact return value or operation is not specified in the given output description.** 

Since no specific output behavior is described, I've outlined the parameters and their constraints accurately. If you provide the output behavior, I can refine the functionality description further.
