Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is an integer, `x` is 2, `y` is the largest integer such that `(1 + y) * y <= m`, and `cnt` is the number of valid pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` up to that `y`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `y`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.
