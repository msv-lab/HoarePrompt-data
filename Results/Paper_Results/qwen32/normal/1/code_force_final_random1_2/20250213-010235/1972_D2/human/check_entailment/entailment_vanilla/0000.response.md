Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown

We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Analysis of the Provided Program

The program consists of two functions: `func_1()` and `func_2()`. Let's break down each function:

#### Function `func_1()`

This function appears to be designed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `x` is initialized to 1.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the count of valid pairs.

2. **Outer Loop (`while x * x <= n`):**
   - This loop iterates over possible values of `x` starting from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - The reason for iterating up to \(\sqrt{n}\) is not immediately clear, but it suggests some optimization related to the constraints.

3. **Inner Loop (`while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`):**
   - This loop iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1.
   - The condition `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` ensures that the sums and products remain within the bounds of `n` and `m`.

4. **Condition Check (`if math.gcd(x, y) == 1`):**
   - If the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1, it implies that `x` and `y` are coprime.
   - The code then attempts to increment `cnt` by the minimum of two values:
     - `n / ((x + y) * x)`
     - `m // ((x + y) * y)`

   However, there are a few issues here:
   - The use of floating-point division (`/`) for `n / ((x + y) * x)` might lead to incorrect results because it could result in a non-integer value.
   - The logic to count valid pairs seems flawed. The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` alone does not guarantee that `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.
   - The calculation of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` does not correctly account for all valid pairs `(a, b)`.

#### Function `func_2()`

This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The main issues are:
- Incorrect handling of the gcd condition.
- Incorrect counting mechanism for valid pairs.
- Potential issues with floating-point arithmetic.

Given these issues, the program will not produce the correct output for the given problem.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
