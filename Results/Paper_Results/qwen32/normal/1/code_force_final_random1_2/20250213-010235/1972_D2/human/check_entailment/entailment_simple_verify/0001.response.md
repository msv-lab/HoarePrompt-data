### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:

**Function `func_1()`**:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` is initialized to 1.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the count of valid pairs.

2. **Outer Loop (`while x * x <= n`)**:
   - Iterates over possible values of `x` starting from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - The purpose of this loop is unclear without further context, but it seems to be optimizing the search space.

3. **Inner Loop (`while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`)**:
   - Iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1.
   - Ensures that the sums and products remain within the bounds of `n` and `m`.

4. **Condition Check (`if math.gcd(x, y) == 1`)**:
   - Checks if `x` and `y` are coprime.
   - If true, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of two values:
     - `n / ((x + y) * x)` (floating-point division)
     - `m // ((x + y) * y)` (integer division)

   **Issues**:
   - **Floating-point Division**: Using `/` can lead to non-integer results, which is problematic when counting pairs.
   - **Incorrect Logic**: The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` alone does not ensure that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). The program needs to verify the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\) for each pair.
   - **Incorrect Counting Mechanism**: The program incorrectly counts pairs by using the minimum of two potentially fractional values instead of checking each pair individually.

**Function `func_2()`**:
- Reads the number of test cases `t`.
- Calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations indicate the state of variables at certain points but do not address the logical flaws in the program.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The main issues are:
- Incorrect handling of the gcd condition.
- Incorrect counting mechanism for valid pairs.
- Potential issues with floating-point arithmetic.

Given these issues, the program will not produce the correct output for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
