In this case, the loop head contains only one variable, `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times (`t` times). The loop does not depend on the value of `_` itself but rather on the iteration count.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to adjust the state to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Since `_` is a throwaway variable, its value does not matter for the continuation of the loop. What matters is the decrement in the number of iterations left, which is represented by `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration.

So, if `t` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `k-1` at the start of the next iteration, provided `k-1` is still greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` - 1 <= 10^4** 

However, to be more precise and clear, we should explicitly state that `t` is decremented by 1:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 < `t` <= 10^4** 

But since `t` must be positive for the loop to continue, we can refine it further:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` < 10^4** 

This ensures that `t` is still a valid positive integer and the loop can execute one more time. If `t` were 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it would become 0 at the start of the next iteration, and the loop would terminate. Therefore, the correct state should reflect that `t` is still within the valid range for another iteration.

Final State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` < 10^4**
