To determine the new state after executing the given code, we need to compute the value of `cnt` based on the provided initial conditions.

Given:
- `n` must be at least 18
- `m` must be at least 18
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 3
- The greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1 (though this condition doesn't affect the calculation directly)

The code snippet is:
```python
cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

First, let's substitute the known values into the expressions inside the `min` function:

1. Calculate `(x + y) * x`:
   \[
   (x + y) * x = (3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18
   \]

2. Calculate `n / ((x + y) * x)`:
   \[
   n / 18
   \]
   Since `n` is at least 18, `n / 18` will be at least 1.

3. Calculate `(x + y) * y`:
   \[
   (x + y) * y = (3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18
   \]

4. Calculate `m // ((x + y) * y)`:
   \[
   m // 18
   \]
   Since `m` is at least 18, `m // 18` will be at least 1.

The `min` function will take the smaller of these two values:
\[
\text{min}(n / 18, m // 18)
\]

Since both `n / 18` and `m // 18` are at least 1, the minimum value will be at least 1. However, without specific values for `n` and `m`, we cannot determine the exact value of `cnt`. But we know that `cnt` will be incremented by at least 1.

Therefore, the updated state is that `cnt` has been incremented by at least 1, and all other conditions remain the same.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 18, `m` must be at least 18, `x` is 3, `y` is 3, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, and `cnt` has been incremented by at least 1.**
