To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be at least 12.
- `m` must be at least 4.
- `x` is 3.
- `y` is 2.
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is incremented by 1 (though `cnt` is not part of the loop condition).

Let's evaluate the current values of `x` and `y` against the conditions:

1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
   - Substituting the values: `(3 + 2) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - For the loop to continue, `15 <= n` must be true. Since `n` must be at least 12, this condition is already satisfied.

2. `(x + y) * y <= m`
   - Substituting the values: `(3 + 2) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - For the loop to continue, `10 <= m` must be true. Since `m` must be at least 4, this condition is not satisfied as it stands.

To satisfy the second condition `(x + y) * y <= m`, we need to adjust `m` to be at least 10.

Therefore, the state needs to be modified such that `m` is at least 10.

State: **`n` must be at least 12, `m` must be at least 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 2, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1**.
