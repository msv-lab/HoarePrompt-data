Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then executes `func_1` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value explicitly, but the annotations suggest that the final state involves a calculation related to the sum of the first `t` natural numbers (`t * (t + 1) // 2`).**
