Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down why:

1. **Logic Error in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for a single test case. However, it incorrectly iterates over `x` and `y` in a way that does not cover all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the constraints `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`. Specifically, it only considers pairs where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, which is not sufficient to find all valid pairs. The condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` needs to be checked for all pairs `(a, b)`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Count**: The count is calculated using `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`, which is not the correct way to count the number of valid pairs. This formula does not accurately reflect the number of pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given condition.

3. **Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are too restrictive and do not ensure that all possible pairs `(a, b)` are considered.

To fix the program, you need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` for each pair. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version iterates over all pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition directly, ensuring that all valid pairs are counted. However, this approach may not be efficient enough for the upper constraint limits (`n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6`). For very large inputs, further optimization would be necessary, possibly involving mathematical insights or precomputation techniques.
