To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to analyze the given information and deduce the behavior of the loop based on the provided output states.

From the problem statement, we know:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- After each iteration, the function `func_1()` is called.
- We are given specific output states after the first three iterations, including a condition on `t` and a result variable `result`.

Let's break down the information:

1. **After the first iteration**:
   - `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
   
2. **After the second iteration**:
   - `t` becomes a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` < 10^4.
   
3. **After the third iteration**:
   - `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` < 10^4.
   - `result` is `t * 2`.

From the third point, it seems like `result` is being updated based on `t`. Since `result` is `t * 2` after three iterations, we can infer that `result` is likely being updated as `result += t` within `func_1()`. This means that with each iteration, `result` is incremented by the current value of `t`.

Given that `t` decreases by 1 with each iteration (as seen from the transition from the first to the second iteration), we can deduce that `t` starts at some value and decrements by 1 until it reaches 0. The loop will stop when `t` becomes 0.

Let's summarize the behavior:
- Initially, `t` is set to some value between 1 and 10^4.
- With each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.
- `result` is incremented by the current value of `t` in each iteration.

Therefore, after all iterations, `t` will be 0, and `result` will be the sum of all integers from 1 to the initial value of `t`.

The formula for the sum of the first `n` positive integers is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

Thus, the final output state will be:
- `t` is 0.
- `result` is the sum of all integers from 1 to the initial value of `t`.

Using the formula, if the initial value of `t` is `n`, then `result` will be \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

Since we do not know the exact initial value of `t`, we express the final state in terms of the initial `t`:

Output State: **t is 0; result is t * (t + 1) // 2.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, and `result` will be the sum of all integers from 1 to the initial value of `t`.
