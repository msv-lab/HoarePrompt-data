Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` satisfying the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`. However, the current implementation does not correctly iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check the condition properly.

2. **Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions in `func_1` are not correctly set up to cover all pairs `(a, b)`. Specifically, the loops are iterating over `x` and `y` such that `x * x <= n` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. This does not ensure that all pairs `(a, b)` within the ranges `[1, n]` and `[1, m]` are checked.

3. **Counting Logic**: The counting logic inside the loop is also incorrect. The expression `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`. It seems to be attempting to count pairs based on a specific relationship between `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`, but this is not aligned with the problem's requirement to check all pairs `(a, b)` directly.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when `n` or `m` is very small, the program might miss valid pairs due to the incorrect loop conditions.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the ranges `[1, n]` and `[1, m]` and check the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` for each pair. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version iterates over all pairs `(a, b)` and checks the required condition, ensuring that all potential cases are handled correctly.
