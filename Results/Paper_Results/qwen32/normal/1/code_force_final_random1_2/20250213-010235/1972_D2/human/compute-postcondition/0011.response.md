To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` and add its value to `cnt`.

Given:
- `n` must be at least 3
- `m` must be at least 6
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 2
- `cnt` is at least 1

Let's substitute the values of `x` and `y` into the expression:

1. Calculate `(x + y) * x`:
   \[
   (1 + 2) * 1 = 3
   \]

2. Calculate `(x + y) * y`:
   \[
   (1 + 2) * 2 = 6
   \]

3. Evaluate `n / ((x + y) * x)`:
   \[
   n / 3
   \]
   Since `n` is at least 3, `n / 3` is at least 1.

4. Evaluate `m // ((x + y) * y)`:
   \[
   m // 6
   \]
   Since `m` is at least 6, `m // 6` is at least 1.

5. Determine the minimum of `n / 3` and `m // 6`:
   \[
   \text{min}(n / 3, m // 6)
   \]
   Both expressions are at least 1, so the minimum value could be 1 or more depending on the exact values of `n` and `m`. However, since we are only given the minimum constraints, we can assume the minimum possible value which is 1.

6. Add this minimum value to `cnt`:
   \[
   cnt += 1
   \]

Thus, `cnt` increases by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is at least 2.**
