The value of `y` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `y` was 1, so now `y` is 2. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `gcd(x, y) == 1`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 3, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `gcd(x, y) == 1`, and `cnt` is the number of valid pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` up to the original `y`, plus 1 since the current pair `(2, 1)` satisfies `gcd(2, 1) == 1`.**
