Given the initial state where `x` is 5, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is 6, the `print(cnt)` statement will output the value of the variable `cnt`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
- The variable `cnt` is explicitly stated to have the value 6.
- The `print(cnt)` statement directly outputs the value of `cnt`.

Therefore, the output will be the integer value 6.

Output: **6**
