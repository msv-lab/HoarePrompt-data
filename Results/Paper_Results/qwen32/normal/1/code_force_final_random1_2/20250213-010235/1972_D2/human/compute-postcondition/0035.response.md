To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies the variables `x`, `y`, and `cnt`.

### Loop Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` must be at least 4.
   - `m` is an integer.
   - `x` is initialized to 2.
   - `y` is initialized to 1.
   - `cnt` is the count of valid pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` up to the original `y`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
   - `y` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.

### Iteration Details:

- **First Iteration:**
  - `x = 2`, `y = 1`
  - `gcd(2, 1) == 1`
  - `cnt` is incremented by `min(n / 6, m // 3)`
  - `y` becomes 2

- **Second Iteration:**
  - `x = 2`, `y = 2`
  - `gcd(2, 2) != 1`
  - `cnt` remains unchanged
  - `y` becomes 3

- **Third Iteration:**
  - `x = 2`, `y = 3`
  - `gcd(2, 3) == 1`
  - `cnt` is incremented by `min(n / 8, m // 8)`
  - `y` becomes 4

### Determining the Final State:

The loop will continue until the condition `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m` is met. Let's assume `n` and `m` are large enough to allow further iterations, but we need to find when the loop terminates.

- **Fourth Iteration:**
  - `x = 2`, `y = 4`
  - `gcd(2, 4) != 1`
  - `cnt` remains unchanged
  - `y` becomes 5

- **Fifth Iteration:**
  - `x = 2`, `y = 5`
  - `gcd(2, 5) == 1`
  - `cnt` is incremented by `min(n / 14, m // 10)`
  - `y` becomes 6

This process continues until the loop condition fails. For simplicity, let's assume the loop terminates after these iterations because `(x + y) * x` or `(x + y) * y` exceeds `n` or `m`.

### Final Output State:

Assuming `n` and `m` are sufficiently large, the loop will increment `cnt` based on the valid pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1`. Given the initial conditions and the increments from valid pairs, the final state can be summarized as follows:

- `x` remains 2 (since it does not change within the loop).
- `y` will be the value that causes the loop condition to fail.
- `cnt` will be incremented by the number of valid pairs `(2, y)` where `gcd(2, y) == 1` and the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` holds.

### Conclusion:

Let's assume the loop terminates after `y` reaches a value that makes the condition fail. For the sake of this problem, we can consider the final `y` to be the value just before the loop condition fails.

**Output State:** `n` must be at least 4, `m` is an integer, `x` is 2, `y` is the value that causes the loop condition to fail, and `cnt` is the number of valid pairs `(2, y)` where `gcd(2, y) == 1` and the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` holds.

Output State: **n must be at least 4, m is an integer, x is 2, y is the value that causes the loop condition to fail, and cnt is the number of valid pairs (2, y) where gcd(2, y) == 1 and the condition (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m holds.**
