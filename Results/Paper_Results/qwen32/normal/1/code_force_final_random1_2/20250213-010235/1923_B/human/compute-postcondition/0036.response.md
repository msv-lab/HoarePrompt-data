The value of `rest` is decreased by `delta`. Given that `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, the new value of `rest` will be `rest - delta`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where some values may be reduced to 0, `x` is unchanged, `k` must be greater than 0, `n` is unchanged, `sorted_indices` is unchanged, `distance` is 1, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`, `rest` is `rest - delta`, `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.**

In natural language: The value of `rest` has been reduced by `delta`, which is the smaller of the current `rest` and the health of the monster at the position indicated by `sorted_indices[pos]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
