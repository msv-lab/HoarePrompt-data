Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, a list of integers representing the health of monsters; `x`, a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters; and `k`, an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. The length of `a` and `x` is the same and represents the number of monsters, `n`. The function returns `False` in three different cases and `True` in one specific case.**
