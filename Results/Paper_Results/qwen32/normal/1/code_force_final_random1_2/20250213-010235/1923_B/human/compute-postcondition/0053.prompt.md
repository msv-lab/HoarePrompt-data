Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where some values may be reduced to 0, `x` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `sorted_indices` is unchanged, `distance` is 1, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`, and `rest` is `k`. If the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` equals `distance`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return and continues execution.
Code of the loop:
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
    rest -= delta
    a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
    if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
        pos += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where the health of the monster at `sorted_indices[pos]` is now `0` if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was originally `0`. `x` is unchanged; `k` is greater than 0; `n` is unchanged; `sorted_indices` is unchanged; `distance` is 1; `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices` and has been incremented by 1 if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was `0`. `rest` is `rest - delta`; `delta` is the minimum of `rest` (before the decrement) and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` (before the decrement) if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was `0`. Otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is not necessarily `0`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where the health of the monster at `sorted_indices[pos]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta` if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was originally not `0`. `x` is unchanged; `k` is greater than 0; `n` is unchanged; `sorted_indices` is unchanged; `distance` is 1; `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices` minus one and has been incremented by 1 if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was `0`. `rest` is `rest - delta`; `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where the health of the monster at `sorted_indices[pos]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta` if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was originally not `0`. `x` is unchanged; `k` is greater than 0; `n` is unchanged; `sorted_indices` is unchanged; `distance` is 1; `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices` minus one and has been incremented by 1 if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was `0` or if the original `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was not `0`. `rest` is `rest - delta`; `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
