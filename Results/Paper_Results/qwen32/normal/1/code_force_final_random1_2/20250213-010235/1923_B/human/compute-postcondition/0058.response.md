Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where the total reduction in health is equal to the initial value of `k` or until all monsters are processed. `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged. `distance` is now 2. `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`. `rest` is 0 if all `k` units were used up, otherwise it is a positive value indicating unused units. If the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` equals `distance`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function continues without returning.**
