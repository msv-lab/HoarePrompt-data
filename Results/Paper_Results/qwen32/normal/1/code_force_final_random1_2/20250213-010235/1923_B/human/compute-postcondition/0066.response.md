Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where the total reduction in health is equal to the initial value of `k` or until all monsters are processed; `x`, `k` must be greater than 0; `n`, and `sorted_indices` must have at least one element; `distance` is now 2; if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `pos` is incremented to 1; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged; `rest` is equal to `k - delta`; `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`; `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0 if it was initially 0, otherwise it is reduced by `delta`.**
