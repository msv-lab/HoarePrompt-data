Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`; `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters; `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second; `n` is the length of the list `a` (and `x`); `sorted_indices` is a list of indices sorted by the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`; `distance` is 0; `rest` is `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`; `delta` is `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`; `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The health of the monster at the position specified by `sorted_indices[pos]` in the list `a` has been reduced by `delta`. All other variables remain unchanged.
