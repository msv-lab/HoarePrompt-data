Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the remaining health of monsters after applying the maximum possible reduction of `k`. `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged. `distance` is 3. `pos` is the index of the next unprocessed monster or equal to the length of `sorted_indices` if all monsters are processed. `rest` is 0.**

In simple terms, the only change is that `distance` has been incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain the same.
