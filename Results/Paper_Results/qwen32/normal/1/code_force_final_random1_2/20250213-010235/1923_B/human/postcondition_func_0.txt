The function `func_1` determines whether it is possible to defeat all monsters by firing bullets such that no two monsters are at the same distance from the starting point when they are defeated. It accepts a list `a` of integers representing the health of monsters, a list `x` of integers representing their initial positions, and an integer `k` representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. The function modifies the list `a` to set the health of defeated monsters to zero and returns `False` if any two monsters are at the same distance from the starting point when they are defeated, otherwise it returns `True`.
