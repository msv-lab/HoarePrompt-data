Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of monsters where `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`; `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters; `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second; `n` is the length of the list `a` (and `x`); `sorted_indices` is a list of indices sorted by the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`; `distance` is 0; `pos` is incremented by 1; `rest` is `rest - delta`; `delta` is `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**

Explanation: The variable `pos` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
