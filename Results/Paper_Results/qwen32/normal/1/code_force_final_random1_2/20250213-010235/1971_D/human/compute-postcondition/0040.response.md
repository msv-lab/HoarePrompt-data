Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string with length greater than 1, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `j` is 0, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, and `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1'.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the variable `flag` has been set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values.
