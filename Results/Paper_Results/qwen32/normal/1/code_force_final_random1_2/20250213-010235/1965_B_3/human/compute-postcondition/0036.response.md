Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, and `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. If `k` equals 1, the list is set to `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. Otherwise, the list is set to `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2]`.**
