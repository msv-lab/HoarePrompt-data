The code appends the value `2 * k + 1` to the list `ans`. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `lk` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 2 <= k <= n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`, and `ans` is a list containing `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`.**
