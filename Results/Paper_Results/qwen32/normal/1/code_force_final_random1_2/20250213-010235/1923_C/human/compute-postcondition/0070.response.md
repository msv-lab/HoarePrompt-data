Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 2 elements
- `p` is `[0, i, 2 * x]`
- `c` is `[0, j, j]`
- `i` is `x` + `x`
- `j` is 2 if `x` equals 1, otherwise `j` is 1
- `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the last iteration
- `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]` from the last iteration
- `x` is the next element in the list `l`

Code Snippet:
```python
j += 1
```

Impact of the code:
- The value of `j` is incremented by 1.

Since only `j` is affected, the new value of `j` will be its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 2 elements; `p` is `[0, i, 2 * x]`; `c` is `[0, j, j]`; `i` is `x` + `x`; `j` is `j + 1` (where `j` was originally 2 if `x` equals 1, otherwise `j` was 1); `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the last iteration; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]` from the last iteration; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
