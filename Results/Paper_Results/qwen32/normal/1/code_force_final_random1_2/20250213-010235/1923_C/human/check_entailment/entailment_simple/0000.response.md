### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and see if it correctly determines whether a subarray is "good" according to the problem statement.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Condition 1**: The sum of the subarray should be equal to the sum of another array \( b \) of the same length.
2. **Condition 2**: Every element in the subarray should be different from the corresponding element in \( b \).
3. **Condition 3**: All elements in \( b \) must be greater than 0.

#### Analysis of the Code:
- The code calculates two cumulative arrays:
  - `p`: Cumulative sum of the elements in the array `l`.
  - `c`: Cumulative count of the number of 1s in the array `l`.
- For each query, it calculates:
  - `s`: Sum of the elements in the subarray `l[a-1:b]` using the cumulative sum array `p`.
  - `i`: Count of 1s in the subarray `l[a-1:b]` using the cumulative count array `c`.
- The condition checked is:
  - `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has more than one element.
  - `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` checks if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the number of 1s in the subarray.

#### Why This Condition Works:
- If `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, it means that after subtracting the number of elements in the subarray from its sum, we still have a value that is at least the number of 1s in the subarray. This implies that we can construct an array \( b \) where each element is greater than 0, different from the corresponding element in the subarray, and the sum of \( b \) is equal to the sum of the subarray.
- Specifically, for each 1 in the subarray, we can set the corresponding element in \( b \) to 2 (or any other value greater than 1), and for all other elements, we can adjust them accordingly to ensure the sum remains the same while ensuring no element is equal to the corresponding element in the subarray.

#### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
