Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least two elements
- `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_next, i]`
- `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j, j]`
- `i` is `x_next + x`
- If `x` is 1, then `j` is `j + 1`
- `x` is the next element in the list `l`

Code Snippet:
```python
i += x
```

Impact Analysis:
- The code snippet increments the value of `i` by `x`.

Since `i` was initially defined as `x_next + x`, after executing `i += x`, the new value of `i` will be `x_next + x + x`, which simplifies to `x_next + 2*x`.

Other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `x`, `x_next`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated value of `i` is `x_next + 2*x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least two elements; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_next, i]`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j, j]`; `i` is `x_next + 2*x`; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
