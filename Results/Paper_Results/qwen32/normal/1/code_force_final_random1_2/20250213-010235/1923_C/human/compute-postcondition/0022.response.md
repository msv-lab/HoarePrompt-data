The code snippet `i += x` increments the value of `i` by the value of `x`. Given the initial state, `i` was previously defined as `i + x`, and now it will be further incremented by the current value of `x`.

Here's the updated state:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` remain the integers obtained from the input.
- `l` remains the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element.
- `p` was initially `[0, i, i + x]`. After the increment, `p` becomes `[0, i, i + x + x]` or `[0, i, i + 2*x]`.
- `c` remains `[0, j, j]`.
- `i` is now `i + x` (previous value) plus `x`, so `i` becomes `i + 2*x`.
- `j` remains the previous value of `j` plus 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains the same.
- `x` remains the next element in the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `p` is [0, `i`, `i + 2*x`]; `c` is [0, `j`, `j`]; `i` is `i + 2*x`; `j` is the previous value of `j` plus 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains the same; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
