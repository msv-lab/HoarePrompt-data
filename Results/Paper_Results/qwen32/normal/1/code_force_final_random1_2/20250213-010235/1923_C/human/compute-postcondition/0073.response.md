The code appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Given that `i` is defined as `x + x + x` (or `3 * x`), the new element added to `p` will be `3 * x`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` remain integers obtained from the input.
- `l` remains a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 2 elements.
- `p` now includes the new element `3 * x`, making it `[0, i, 2 * x, 3 * x]`.
- `c` remains `[0, j, j]` where `j` is incremented by 1 if `x` equals 1.
- `i` remains `x + x + x` (or `3 * x`).
- `a` and `b` remain integers obtained from the input in the last iteration.
- `s` remains `p[b] - p[a - 1]` from the last iteration.
- `x` remains the next element in the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 2 elements; `p` is `[0, i, 2 * x, 3 * x]`; `c` is `[0, j, j]` where `j` is incremented by 1 if `x` equals 1; `i` is `x + x + x`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the last iteration; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]` from the last iteration; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
