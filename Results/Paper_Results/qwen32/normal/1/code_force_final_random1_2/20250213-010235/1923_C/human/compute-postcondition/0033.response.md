Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's break down the situation step by step:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `n` and `m`: Integers where `m` is at least 1.
   - `l`: A list of integers.
   - `p`: A list constructed as `[0, i1, i1 + x2, ..., i1 + x2 + ... + xn]`.
   - `c`: A list constructed as `[0, j1, j1 + (1 if x2 == 1 else 0), ..., j1 + (1 if x2 == 1 else 0) + ... + (1 if xn == 1 else 0)]`.
   - `i`: Count of 1s in the sublist of `l` from index `a-1` to `b-1`.
   - `j`: Total count of 1s in `l`.
   - `a` and `b`: Integers obtained from the input.
   - `s`: Calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

2. **Condition:**
   - Either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - `print('NO')`

The print statement `print('NO')` is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described above. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **NO**
