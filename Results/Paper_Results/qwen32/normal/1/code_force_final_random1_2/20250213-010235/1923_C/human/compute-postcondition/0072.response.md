Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 2 elements; `p` is `[0, i, 2 * x]`; `c` is `[0, j, j]` where `j` is incremented by 1 if `x` equals 1; `i` is `x` + `x` + `x`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the last iteration; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]` from the last iteration; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by `x`, so `i` becomes `x + x + x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
