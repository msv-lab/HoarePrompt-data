The code snippet `c = [0]` reassigns the list `c` to a new list containing only the integer `0`. This means the previous contents of `c` are discarded and replaced with `[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is [0]; `c` is [0]; `i` is the count of 1s in the sublist of `l` from index `a-1` to `b-1` from the last iteration; `j` is the count of 1s in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the last iteration; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]` from the last iteration.**
