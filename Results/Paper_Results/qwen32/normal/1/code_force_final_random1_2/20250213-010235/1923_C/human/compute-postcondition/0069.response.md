The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which is being iterated over the list `l`. Therefore, we need to adjust `x` to the next element in the list `l` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 2 elements
- `p` is [0, i, 2 * x]
- `c` is [0, j, j]
- `i` is `x` + `x`
- `j` is 2 if `x` equals 1, otherwise `j` is 1
- `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the last iteration
- `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]` from the last iteration
- `x` is the next element in the list `l`

Since `x` is the current element being processed in the loop, for the next iteration, `x` should be updated to the subsequent element in the list `l`.

Let's denote the current index of `x` in `l` as `current_index`. Since `x` is the next element in the list `l` at the end of the previous iteration, `current_index` would be the index of `x` in `l`. For the next iteration, `x` should be `l[current_index + 1]`.

However, since we don't have the exact value of `current_index`, we can simply state that `x` is now the next element in the list `l` after the current `x`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 2 elements; `p` is [0, i, 2 * x]; `c` is [0, j, j]; `i` is `x` + `x`; `j` is 2 if `x` equals 1, otherwise `j` is 1; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input in the last iteration; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]` from the last iteration; `x` is the next element in the list `l`**
