Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's break down the context and determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers with `m > 0`.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, starting with `0`.
- `c` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of `1`s encountered in `l` up to that point, starting with `0`.
- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, representing the count of `1`s between indices `a-1` and `b` in `l`.
- `j` is the total count of `1`s in the list `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, representing the sum of elements between indices `a-1` and `b` in `l`.
- Additional conditions: `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`, or `s`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is always `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables.

Output: **YES**
