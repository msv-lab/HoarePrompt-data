The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. Given the initial state, `m` is initially set to 1, but the new value of `m` will be determined by the input.

Since `n` and `m` are being reassigned based on the input, the new values of `n` and `m` will replace their previous values. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0; `c` is a list of cumulative counts of 1s starting with 0; `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `j` is the count of 1s in `l`.**
