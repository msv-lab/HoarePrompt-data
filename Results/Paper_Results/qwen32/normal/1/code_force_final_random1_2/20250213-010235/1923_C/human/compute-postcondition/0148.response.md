Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x1, x1+x2, ..., x1+x2+...+xn]` where `x1, x2, ..., xn` are the elements of `l`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j1, j2, ..., jn]` where `ji` is the cumulative count of 1s encountered up to the `i-th` element of `l`; `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the program follows the if part logic; otherwise, it follows the else part logic, which in this case does not change any of the variables. `a` and `b` have been updated to the values obtained from the input.**
