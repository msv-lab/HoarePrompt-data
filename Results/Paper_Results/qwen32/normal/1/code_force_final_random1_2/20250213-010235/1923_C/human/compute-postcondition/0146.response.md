To determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement executes, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `n` and `m`: Integers where `m` is at least 1.
   - `l`: A list of integers.
   - `p`: A prefix sum list derived from `l` where `p[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `l` (including `l[0]`).
   - `c`: A cumulative count list where `c[i]` is the count of 1s in the first `i` elements of `l`.
   - `i`: Calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, representing the count of 1s in the sublist `l[a-1:b]`.
   - `j`: Total count of 1s in the list `l`.
   - `a` and `b`: Integers representing indices of the sublist in `l`.
   - `s`: Calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, representing the sum of the sublist `l[a-1:b]`.

2. **Condition:**
   - The `if` condition checks if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`.
   - If the condition is true, the program follows the `if` part logic.
   - If the condition is false, the program follows the `else` part logic, which does not change any variables.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement is executed regardless of the condition because it is outside any conditional block.

Given the above analysis, the `print('YES')` statement will always execute and print "YES" based on the provided code snippet and initial state.

Output: **YES**
