The code snippet provided only modifies the list `p`, setting it to `[0]`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `c`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing a single element `[0]`; `c` is a list of cumulative counts of 1s starting with 0; `i` is the sum of all elements in the original `l`; `j` is the count of 1s in the original `l`.**
