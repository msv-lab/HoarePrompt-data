The given code snippet updates the value of `s` based on the cumulative sums stored in the list `p`. The new value of `s` is calculated as the difference between `p[b]` and `p[a - 1]`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `s`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0 and will be decremented by 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0; `c` is a list of cumulative counts of 1s starting with 0; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the current input in the form `map(int, input().split())`; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`; `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the count of 1s in `l`.**
