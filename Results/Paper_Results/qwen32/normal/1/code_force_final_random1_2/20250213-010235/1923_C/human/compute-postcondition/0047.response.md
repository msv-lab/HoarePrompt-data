Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m`: Integers obtained from the input, with `m > 0`.
- `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
- `p`: A list constructed as `[0, i1, i1 + x2, ..., i1 + x2 + ... + xn]`.
- `c`: A list constructed as `[0, j1, j1 + (1 if x2 == 1 else 0), ..., j1 + (1 if x2 == 1 else 0) + ... + (1 if xn == 1 else 0)]`.
- `i`: Calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `j`: The count of 1s in the list `l`.
- `a` and `b`: Integers obtained from the input.
- `s`: Calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

### Code Snippet:

```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. This output is independent of the values of any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `s`). The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:

The code will print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables defined in the initial state.

Output: **NO**
