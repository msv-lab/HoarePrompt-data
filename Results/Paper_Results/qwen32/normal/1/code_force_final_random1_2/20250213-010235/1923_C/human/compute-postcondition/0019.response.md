The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which is being iterated over the list `l`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` for the next iteration. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`) are not directly controlled by the loop head and should remain as they are unless they are modified within the loop body (which is omitted here).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element
- `p` is [0, `i`, `i + x`]
- `c` is [0, `j`, `j`]
- `i` is `i + x`
- `j` is 1 if the previous `j` was 0 and `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains the same
- `x` is the next element in the list `l`

Since `x` is the current element being processed in the loop, for the next iteration, `x` should be updated to the next element in the list `l`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `x` is the next element in the list `l` after the current `x`

Assuming the current `x` was the k-th element in the list `l`, then the next `x` would be the (k+1)-th element in the list `l`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `p` is [0, `i`, `i + x`]; `c` is [0, `j`, `j`]; `i` is `i + x`; `j` is 1 if the previous `j` was 0 and `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains the same; `x` is the next element in the list `l`**
