### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
We need to determine if a subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]` is "good". A subarray is considered "good" if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that:
1. The sum of elements in `c[l_i:r_i+1]` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
2. Each element in `c[l_i:r_i+1]` is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
3. All elements in `b` are positive.

To satisfy these conditions, the sum of the subarray must be at least as large as the number of elements in the subarray (since we need to ensure that each element in `b` is positive and different from the corresponding element in `c`). If the subarray has only one element, it cannot be "good" because we cannot find a positive `b_i` that is different from `c_i`.

#### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution uses prefix sums and counts of 1s to determine if a subarray is "good".

1. **Prefix Sum Array (`p`)**: This array stores the cumulative sum of the elements up to each index in the list `l`. This allows us to quickly compute the sum of any subarray.
   
2. **Count of 1s Array (`c`)**: This array stores the cumulative count of 1s up to each index in the list `l`. This allows us to quickly count the number of 1s in any subarray.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the solution computes:
   - The sum of the subarray using the prefix sum array.
   - The count of 1s in the subarray using the count of 1s array.
   - It then checks if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1s in the subarray. If this condition holds and the subarray has more than one element, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  5 4
  1 2 1 4 5
  1 5
  4 4
  3 4
  1 3
  ```

- **Execution:**
  - **Prefix Sum Array (`p`)**: `[0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 13]`
  - **Count of 1s Array (`c`)**: `[0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`
  
  - **Queries:**
    - **Query 1 (1 5)**: 
      - Sum of subarray: `13 - 0 = 13`
      - Count of 1s: `2 - 0 = 2`
      - Condition: `13 - 5 >= 2` (True), and the subarray has more than one element.
      - Output: `YES`
      
    - **Query 2 (4 4)**: 
      - Sum of subarray: `13 - 8 = 5`
      - Count of 1s: `2 - 2 = 0`
      - Condition: `5 - 1 >= 0` (True), but the subarray has only one element.
      - Output: `NO`
      
    - **Query 3 (3 4)**: 
      - Sum of subarray: `8 - 4 = 4`
      - Count of 1s: `2 - 2 = 0`
      - Condition: `4 - 2 >= 0` (True), and the subarray has more than one element.
      - Output: `YES`
      
    - **Query 4 (1 3)**: 
      - Sum of subarray: `4 - 0 = 4`
      - Count of 1s: `2 - 0 = 2`
      - Condition: `4 - 3 >= 2` (False).
      - Output: `NO`

The solution correctly handles the example input and produces the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. Therefore, the solution is correct.

**Correctness: True**
