Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is [0, i1, i1 + x2, ..., i1 + x2 + ... + xn]; `c` is [0, j1, j1 + (1 if x2 == 1 else 0), ..., j1 + (1 if x2 == 1 else 0) + ... + (1 if xn == 1 else 0)]; `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`; `j` is the count of 1s in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, the conditions also remain as specified.**
