Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if the sum of the elements in a specified range of the list, minus the number of elements in that range, is greater than or equal to the count of 1s in that range, and prints 'YES' if true, otherwise 'NO'.**
