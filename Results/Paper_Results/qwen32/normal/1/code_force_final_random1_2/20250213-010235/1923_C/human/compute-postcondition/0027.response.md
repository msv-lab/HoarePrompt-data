The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This operation does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`). Therefore, the only changes are the introduction of the new variables `a` and `b` with the values obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is [0, i1, i1 + x2, ..., i1 + x2 + ... + xn], where in is the cumulative sum of the elements processed so far; `c` is [0, j1, j1 + (1 if x2 == 1 else 0), ..., j1 + (1 if x2 == 1 else 0) + ... + (1 if xn == 1 else 0)], where jn is the count of 1s encountered so far; `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `j` is the count of 1s in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input.**
