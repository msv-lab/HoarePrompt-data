The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` is initially set to 1 if `x_next` is equal to 1, otherwise `j` is 0. After the increment operation, `j` will be 2 if it was initially 1, or `j` will be 1 if it was initially 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_next]`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j]`; `i` is `x_next`; `j` is 2 if `x_next` is 1, otherwise `j` is 1.**
