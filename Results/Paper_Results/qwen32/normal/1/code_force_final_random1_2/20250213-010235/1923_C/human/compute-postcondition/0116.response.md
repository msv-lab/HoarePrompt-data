Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element; `p` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_next]`; `c` is a list containing the elements `[0, j]`; `i` is `x_next + x`; `j` is 2 if `x` is 1 and `x_next` is 1, otherwise `j` is 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `i` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value (`x_next`) and `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
