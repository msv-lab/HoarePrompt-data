The code snippet `best = i` updates the value of `best` to the current value of `i`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, `best` now holds the value of the incremented `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `res` is the new input string, `best` is the current value of `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
