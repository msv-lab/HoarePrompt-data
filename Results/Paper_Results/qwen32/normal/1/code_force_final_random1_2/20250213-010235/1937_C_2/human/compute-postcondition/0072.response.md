Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `res` is the new input string. If `res` equals '<', then `best` is set to 2. Otherwise, `best` remains 0.
- `i` is 3.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

From the initial state, we know the following:
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `best` is either 2 if `res` equals '<', or 0 otherwise.
- `k` is not mentioned in the initial state, so its value is unknown from the given information.

Given this, we can deduce the following:
- The string `'?'` will be printed as is.
- The value of `k` will be printed twice.
- The value of `best` will be either 2 or 0, depending on the value of `res`.
- The value of `i` is 3.

Since the value of `k` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact numerical value. Therefore, we will represent it as `k`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? [k] [best] [k] 3 (where best is 2 if res equals '<', otherwise 0, and k is the value of k)**
