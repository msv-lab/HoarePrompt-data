You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        k = 1
        for i in range(2, n):
            print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                k = i
        best = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                best = i
        print('!', k, best, flush=True)



- Function Summary: 
For each test case, the function determines and prints a pair of indices from the given permutation `p` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. Specifically, it identifies two indices `k` and `best` and outputs them, likely representing a specific relationship or comparison result within the permutation.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, using at most \(3n\) queries. The bitwise XOR operation (\(\oplus\)) results in a high value when the bits of the two numbers differ as much as possible. Therefore, we need to identify the two numbers in the permutation that have the maximum difference in their bit representations.

### Program Explanation

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
2. **First Loop (Finding `k`)**:
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation \(n\).
   - It initializes `k` to 1.
   - It iterates through indices from 2 to \(n-1\) and makes a query comparing \((p_0 \mid p_k)\) with \((p_0 \mid p_i)\).
   - If the result of the query is `<`, it updates `k` to `i`. This loop aims to find an index `k` such that \(p_k\) has a relatively large value in terms of bitwise OR with \(p_0\).
3. **Second Loop (Finding `best`)**:
   - It initializes `best` to 0.
   - It iterates through indices from 1 to \(n-1\) and makes a query comparing \((p_k \mid p_{\text{best}})\) with \((p_k \mid p_i)\).
   - If the result of the query is `<`, it updates `best` to `i`. This loop aims to find an index `best` such that \(p_{\text{best}}\) has a relatively large value in terms of bitwise OR with \(p_k\).
4. **Output**:
   - After the loops, it outputs the indices `k` and `best` as the pair that maximizes the XOR.

### Evaluation

The program uses a strategy to identify two numbers in the permutation that likely have a large XOR value by leveraging the properties of bitwise OR and XOR operations. However, let's consider whether this strategy is sufficient to guarantee finding the pair with the maximum XOR value within the allowed number of queries.

#### Key Points:
- The first loop helps in identifying a number (`p_k`) that has a large bitwise OR value with `p_0`.
- The second loop helps in identifying another number (`p_{\text{best}}`) that has a large bitwise OR value with `p_k`.

While this approach might often work well, it doesn't guarantee that the identified pair will always have the maximum XOR value. The strategy relies on the assumption that the numbers with the largest bitwise OR values will also have the largest XOR values, which isn't always true.

#### Counterexample:
Consider a permutation where the numbers with the largest bitwise OR values do not necessarily have the largest XOR values. For example, if the permutation is `[0, 1, 3, 2]`, the first loop might choose `k` as 2 (since \(0 \mid 2 = 2\) and \(0 \mid 3 = 3\)), and the second loop might choose `best` as 3 (since \(2 \mid 3 = 3\) and \(2 \mid 1 = 3\)). However, the maximum XOR value is actually between `p_1` and `p_2` (i.e., \(1 \oplus 3 = 2\)), which the program might not identify.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program does not guarantee to find the pair of indices that maximizes the XOR value in all cases. Therefore, the program is not correct.
