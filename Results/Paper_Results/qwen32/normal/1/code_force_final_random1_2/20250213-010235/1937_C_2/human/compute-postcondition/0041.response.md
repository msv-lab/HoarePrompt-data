The code snippet sets the variable `k` to 1. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `best`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the integer input by the user, `k` is 1, `best` is the last index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the response was `'<'`**.
