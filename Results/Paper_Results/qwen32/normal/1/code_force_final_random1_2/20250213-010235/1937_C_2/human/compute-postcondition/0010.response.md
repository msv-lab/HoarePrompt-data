Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **t**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. This variable represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it is not directly used in the print statement.
2. **n**: An integer greater than 2. This variable is not directly used in the print statement.
3. **k**: This variable is set to `i` if `res` equals `'<'`, otherwise `k` remains 1.
4. **res**: This is a string input by the user. It determines the value of `k`.
5. **i**: This variable is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`). It is used in the print statement.

### Print Statement Analysis:

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

- **'?'**: This is a literal string.
- **0**: This is a literal integer.
- **k**: This value depends on the condition involving `res`. If `res` is `'<'`, then `k` is set to `i`; otherwise, `k` remains 1.
- **0**: This is another literal integer.
- **i**: This is the current value of `i` after being incremented by 1.
- **flush=True**: This ensures that the output is immediately flushed to the console.

### Determining the Values:

- Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both possibilities:
  - If `res` is `'<'`, then `k` is equal to `i`.
  - If `res` is not `'<'`, then `k` remains 1.
- The value of `i` is `i + 1` where `i` was its previous value.

### Final Output Description:

Given the conditions, the output will be:
- `'?'`: Always printed as is.
- `0`: Always printed as is.
- `k`: Either `i` (if `res` is `'<'`) or `1` (if `res` is not `'<'`).
- `0`: Always printed as is.
- `i`: The incremented value of `i`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 k 0 i (where k is i if res is '<', otherwise k is 1, and i is the incremented value of i)**
