The code snippet provided assigns the value of the integer input by the user to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `k`, and `best`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the integer input by the user, `k` is the largest index i (from 2 to n-1) where the response was '<', or 1 if no such response was received, `best` is the largest index i (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', or 0 if no such response was received**.
