The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` should remain the same.

Given that `res` and `best` are not part of the loop head, their values do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head variables alone. However, for completeness, we note that `res` remains unchanged, and `best` will be updated if `res` is '<' during this new iteration.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `res` is the input string, and if `res` is '<', then `best` is updated to the current index `i` (from 2 to n-1). Otherwise, `best` remains 0. `i` is incremented by 1**
