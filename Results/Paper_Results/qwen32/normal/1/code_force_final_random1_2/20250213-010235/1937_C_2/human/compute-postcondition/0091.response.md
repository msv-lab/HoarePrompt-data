Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is at least 3, `k` is `i` if `res` equals '<', otherwise `k` remains 1, `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the response was '<', or 0 if no such response was received, `res` is the input string, `i` is incremented by 1.**
