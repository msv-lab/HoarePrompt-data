To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. **`n`**: The value of `t` converted from input(). Since it is mentioned that `n` must be greater than 1, `n` will be an integer greater than 1.
3. **`k`**: The largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) where the response was `'<'`, or 1 if no such index exists.
4. **`best`**: Initialized to 0.

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- **`k`**: As described, this is the largest index `i` from 2 to `n-1` where the response was `'<'`, or 1 if no such index exists.
- **`best`**: This is explicitly initialized to 0.
- **`i`**: This variable is not defined in the initial state. It seems like there might be a typo or missing context since `i` is used in the print statement but not defined or explained in the initial state.

Given the lack of definition for `i`, we'll assume the intention was to use `k` instead of `i` in the print statement, as `i` is not provided in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
- **`k`**: Could be any integer from 1 to `n-1` depending on the responses received, but it defaults to 1 if no such index exists.
- **`best`**: Is explicitly 0.
- **`i`**: Assuming it should be `k` based on the context.

### Final Output:
Given the above analysis, the print statement would output:
- `?`
- `k` (which could be any integer from 1 to `n-1` but defaults to 1)
- `best` (which is 0)
- `k` again (assuming it should be `k` instead of `i`)

Therefore, the output would be:
Output: **? [k] 0 [k] (where [k] is the largest index i from 2 to n-1 where the response was '<', or 1 if no such index exists)**
