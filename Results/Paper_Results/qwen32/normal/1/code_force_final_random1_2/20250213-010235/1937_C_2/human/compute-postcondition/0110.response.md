To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3 (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `n` is greater than 1 (this variable defines the upper limit of the loop and does not change within the loop).
- `res` is the new input string (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).
- `i` is incremented by 1 (this variable is part of the loop head and needs adjustment).
- If `res` is '<', then `best` is updated to the current value of `i`; otherwise, `best` remains 0 (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment).

Since the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`, at the start of each iteration, `i` should be the next integer value after its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by another 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `res` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `res` is '<', then `best` is updated to the current value of `i`; otherwise, `best` remains 0. Adjusted for the next iteration: `i` is incremented by 1 again.**

Given the above, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `res` is the new input string, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, and if `res` is '<', then `best` is updated to the current value of `i`; otherwise, `best` remains 0.**

To put it simply:
If `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `res` is the new input string, `i` is 4, and if `res` is '<', then `best` is updated to the current value of `i`; otherwise, `best` remains 0.**

Generalizing this, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `res` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `res` is '<', then `best` is updated to the current value of `i`; otherwise, `best` remains 0.**

Thus, the final adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `res` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `res` is '<', then `best` is updated to the current value of `i`; otherwise, `best` remains 0. Specifically, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` is `x + 1`.**

For simplicity in the given format:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `res` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1**
