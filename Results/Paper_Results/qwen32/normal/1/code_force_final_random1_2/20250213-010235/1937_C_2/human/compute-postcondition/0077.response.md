Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` is the integer input by the user.
- `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) where the response was '<', or 1 if no such response was received.
- `best` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the response was '<', or 0 if no such response was received.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('!', k, best, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement outputs three values separated by spaces: an exclamation mark `'!'`, the value of `k`, and the value of `best`.
- `k` is defined as the largest index `i` from 2 to `n-1` where the response was '<'. If no such response was received, `k` is set to 1.
- `best` is defined as the largest index `i` from 1 to `n-1` where the response was '<'. If no such response was received, `best` is set to 0.

### Output Description:
- The output will always start with `'!'`.
- The next value is `k`, which could be any integer from 1 to `n-1` depending on the responses received. If no '<' response was received from index 2 to `n-1`, `k` defaults to 1.
- The last value is `best`, which could be any integer from 0 to `n-1` depending on the responses received. If no '<' response was received from index 1 to `n-1`, `best` defaults to 0.

Given the above analysis, the final output will be:

Output: **! [k] [best] (where [k] is the largest index i from 2 to n-1 where the response was '<', or 1 if no such response was received, and [best] is the largest index i from 1 to n-1 where the response was '<', or 0 if no such response was received)**
