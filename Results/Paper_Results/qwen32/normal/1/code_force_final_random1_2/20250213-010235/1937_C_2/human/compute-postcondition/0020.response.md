The given code snippet initializes a variable `best` to 0. No other variables are modified in this snippet. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the value of `t` converted from input(), `k` is the largest index `i` (from 2 to `n-1`) where the response was `'<'`, or 1 if no such index exists, `best` is 0.**
