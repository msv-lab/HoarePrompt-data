The code calculates the minimum of `a` and `b`, adds `m` to it, and assigns the result to `mn`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged except for the new variable `mn`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.**
