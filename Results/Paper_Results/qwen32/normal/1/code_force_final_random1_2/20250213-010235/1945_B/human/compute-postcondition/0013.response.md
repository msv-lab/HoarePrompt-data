To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable represents the number of test cases but is not used in the provided code snippet.
   - `a`, `b`, `m`: Integers read from the input.
   - `mn`: Calculated as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.
   - `i`: Set to 1, but this variable is not used in the provided code snippet.
   
2. **Conditional statement:**
   - The condition checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1. However, this condition does not affect the calculation in the `print` statement directly.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
The code snippet contains the following line:
```python
print(mn // a + mn // b)
```

- **`mn` Calculation:**
  - `mn = min(a, b) + m`
  - This means `mn` is the smaller of `a` and `b` added to `m`.

- **Expression `mn // a + mn // b`:**
  - `mn // a`: Integer division of `mn` by `a`.
  - `mn // b`: Integer division of `mn` by `b`.
  - The expression sums these two results.

### Explanation:
Given the definition of `mn` and the expression to be printed, we can describe the output as follows:

- `mn` is the sum of the smaller of `a` and `b` and `m`.
- The expression `mn // a + mn // b` computes the integer division of `mn` by `a` and `mn` by `b`, and then adds these two results together.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not specified, we cannot compute a specific numerical result. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

### Final Output Description:
Output: **(min(a, b) + m) // a + (min(a, b) + m) // b (where `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input)**
