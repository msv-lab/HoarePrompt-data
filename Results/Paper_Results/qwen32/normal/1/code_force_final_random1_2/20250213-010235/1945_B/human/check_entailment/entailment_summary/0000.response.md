### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Key Points from the Problem Statement:
1. **Fireworks Launching Times:**
   - The first installation launches fireworks every `a` minutes.
   - The second installation launches fireworks every `b` minutes.

2. **Visibility Duration:**
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes starting from its launch time.

3. **Objective:**
   - Determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

#### Analysis of the Program:
- The program calculates `mn` as `min(a, b) + m`.
- It then checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and if neither `a` nor `b` is 1.
- If the condition is met, it outputs `mn // a + mn // b + 1`.
- Otherwise, it outputs `mn // a + mn // b`.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation Logic:**
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is incorrect.
   - The current logic does not account for the actual overlap of visibility periods between fireworks from different installations.
   
2. **Special Cases Handling:**
   - The special case handling (`if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)`) is overly simplistic and does not cover all scenarios correctly.
   
3. **General Case Handling:**
   - The general case calculation (`mn // a + mn // b`) also does not accurately reflect the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks.
   - This approach does not consider the exact intervals and overlaps of the visibility periods.

#### Correct Approach:
- To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which gives us the interval after which the launching patterns repeat.
- We then need to count the number of fireworks launched by each installation within a period of `min(a, b) + m` and check their visibility overlaps.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
