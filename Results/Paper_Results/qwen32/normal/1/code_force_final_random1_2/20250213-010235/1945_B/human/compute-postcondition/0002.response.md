The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, but this value is not modified by the given code snippet.

After executing the code, the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` will hold the values read from the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input.**
