Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `i` is `i + 1` (Note: This operation does not have a defined initial value for `i` in the precondition, but it implies that `i` is being incremented by 1).
- `n` and `m` are integers read from input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'No'`. None of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m` are used in this print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
