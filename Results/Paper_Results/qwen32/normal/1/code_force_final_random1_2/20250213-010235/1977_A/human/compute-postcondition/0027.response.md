Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
2. `i` is `i + 1` (Note: There is no initial value of `i` mentioned, but this operation suggests that `i` is incremented by 1).
3. `n` is the first integer read from the new input.
4. `m` is the second integer read from the new input.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'`.
- The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the print statement.
- Therefore, the values of these variables do not affect the output of the print statement.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will simply output the string `'No'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
