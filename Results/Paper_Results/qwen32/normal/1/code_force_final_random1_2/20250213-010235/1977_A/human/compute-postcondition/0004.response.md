Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `i` is initialized by the `range(t)` function, implying `i` will iterate over a range from 0 to `t-1`.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `m` is the second integer read from the input.
- It is explicitly stated that `n` is equal to `m`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` do not affect the output of this particular `print` statement because it does not reference any of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
