In the given initial state, several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`) are mentioned, but their specific values are not explicitly provided. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on these variables.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('No')
```

This `print` statement outputs the string `'No'` directly, regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **No**
