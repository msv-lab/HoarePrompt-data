Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.
- `i` is `i + 1` (Note: This implies that `i` was previously defined somewhere in the code, but its initial value is not provided here. However, this operation does not affect the `print` statement directly).
- `n` and `m` are integers read from input.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is always `'Yes'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
