To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's carefully analyze the logic and conditions it uses to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. We'll compare this with the problem description and the provided function summary.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.
- The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers `n` and `m`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves:
1. If `n == m`, it prints "Yes".
2. If `m > n`, it prints "No".
3. If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes".
4. If both `m` and `n` are even, it prints "Yes".
5. If both `m` and `n` are odd, it prints "Yes".
6. Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Checking for Correctness:
Let's consider various scenarios to see if the program handles all cases correctly:

1. **Case 1: `n == m`**
   - The program correctly prints "Yes". This is straightforward since `n` moves can simply add `m` cubes one by one.

2. **Case 2: `m > n`**
   - The program correctly prints "No". It's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves since each move can only add or remove one cube.

3. **Case 3: `m == n - 1`**
   - The program correctly prints "Yes". This is because we can add `n-1` cubes and remove one, resulting in `m` cubes.

4. **Case 4: Both `m` and `n` are even**
   - The program correctly prints "Yes". This is because we can alternate adding and removing cubes to reach any even number of cubes up to `n`.

5. **Case 5: Both `m` and `n` are odd**
   - The program correctly prints "Yes". Similar to the even case, we can alternate adding and removing cubes to reach any odd number of cubes up to `n`.

6. **General Case: Parity Check**
   - The program relies on the parity (even/odd nature) of `m` and `n` to decide if it's possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is generally correct because:
     - If `n` is even, we can end up with any even `m` between 0 and `n`.
     - If `n` is odd, we can end up with any odd `m` between 0 and `n`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Edge Case 1: `m = 0`**
  - If `n` is even, the program will print "Yes" because `m` can be 0 by alternating additions and removals.
  - If `n` is odd, the program will print "Yes" because `m` can be 0 by adding `(n-1)/2` pairs and removing the last one.

- **Edge Case 2: `m = n`**
  - The program correctly prints "Yes".

- **Edge Case 3: `m = n - 2`**
  - The program might not cover this explicitly but the parity check should handle it correctly.

### Detailed Evaluation:
Let's verify the logic with some additional examples:
- **Test Case 1:** `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - The program prints "Yes" because `n == m`.
- **Test Case 2:** `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - The program prints "No" because `m > n`.
- **Test Case 3:** `n = 5`, `m = 3`
  - The program prints "Yes" because `m == n - 2` and both `m` and `n` have different parities, which falls under the parity check.
- **Test Case 4:** `n = 4`, `m = 2`
  - The program prints "Yes" because `m` and `n` are both even.
- **Test Case 5:** `n = 7`, `m = 5`
  - The program prints "Yes" because `m` and `n` are both odd.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and considering various scenarios, it appears that the program correctly handles all potential cases based on the problem description. There doesn't seem to be any scenario where the program fails to provide the correct output.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks the necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves by considering the parity of `m` and `n` and handling specific edge cases like `m == n` and `m == n - 1`.
