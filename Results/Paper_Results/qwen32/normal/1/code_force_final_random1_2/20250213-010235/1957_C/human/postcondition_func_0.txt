The function `func_1` computes and returns a value based on the input integer `n` using a dynamic programming approach. It calculates a sequence where each term is derived from the previous terms according to a specific formula, and the result is taken modulo 1,000,000,007. The function does not use or modify any other input parameters mentioned in the annotations such as `t`, `k`, `r_i`, or `c_i`.
