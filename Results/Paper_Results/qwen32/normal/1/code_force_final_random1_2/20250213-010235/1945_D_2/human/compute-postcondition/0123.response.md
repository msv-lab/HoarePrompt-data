The given code snippet updates the `total` variable by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are dependent on `total`.

Given:
- `c` is `c + 2`
- `cases` is greater than `c + 2`
- `na_frente` is an integer from the input that must be at least 1
- `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a new list of integers from the input
- `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers from the input
- `v` is `na_frente - 1`
- If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`

After executing `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, the `total` is updated to its previous value plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.

Output State: **`c` is `c + 2`, `cases` is greater than `c + 2`, `na_frente` is an integer from the input that must be at least 1, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a new list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers from the input, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**
