The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p` (inclusive), decrementing `y` by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` was decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be set to the value it had before the last decrement. Since `y` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, the value of `y` at the start of the next iteration should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `y` was `max_p` at the end of the last iteration (which means the loop condition failed when `y` became `max_p - 1`), the value of `y` at the start of the current iteration should be `max_p`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, and `custo` is updated to either `custo + a_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, or `custo + b_values[y]` otherwise, `y` is `max_p`**
