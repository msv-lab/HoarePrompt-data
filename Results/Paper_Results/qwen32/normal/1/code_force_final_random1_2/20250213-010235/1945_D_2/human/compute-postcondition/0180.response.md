To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
```

This means the loop variable `y` will iterate from `max_p - 1` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by `1` each time.

### Analysis of the Loop Head Variables:
- **`y`**: This is the loop variable and its range is determined by `max_p`.
- **`max_p`**: This is the upper limit of the range (exclusive) for `y`.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- For the loop to execute at least once, `max_p - 1` must be greater than or equal to `1`. This implies `max_p` must be at least `2`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`max_p`**: It must be at least `2` to ensure the loop runs at least once.
- **`y`**: Although `y` is initialized automatically by the `range` function, we need to ensure that `max_p` is set correctly so that `y` starts at `max_p - 1` and goes down to `1`.

### Unchanged Variables:
- `i`, `x`, `num_fila`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, `b`, and `custo` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
Given the above analysis, the state before the loop should be adjusted such that `max_p` is at least `2`.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, and `custo` is the accumulated sum of the smaller values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range `(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)`**
