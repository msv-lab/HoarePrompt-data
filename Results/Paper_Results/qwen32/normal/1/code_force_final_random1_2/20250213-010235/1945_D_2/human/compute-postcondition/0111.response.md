The given code snippet increments the `total` variable by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the `total` variable, which now includes the additional cost specified by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

Output State: **`c` is `c + 2`, `cases` is greater than `c + 2`, `na_frente` is an integer from the input that must be at least 1, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a new list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers from the input, `total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged.**
