Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an input integer; `custos` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    custo = 0
    num_fila = 0
    max_p = 0
    a_values = []
    b_values = []
    nf = input().split()
    num_fila = int(nf[0])
    max_p = int(nf[1])
    a = input().split()
    b = input().split()
    for y in a:
        a_values.append(int(y))
    for y in b:
        b_values.append(int(y))
    for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
        if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
            custo += a_values[y]
        else:
            custo += b_values[y]
    for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
        if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
            custo += b_values[y]
            if y == 1:
                custo += a_values[0]
                break
        else:
            custo += a_values[y]
            break
    custos.append(custo)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop terminates after processing the first `y` that meets the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]` or when `y` reaches `1`. The variable `custo` will contain the sum of the appropriate `a_values` and `b_values` as per the loop logic. The list `custos` now includes the value of `custo` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` remains unchanged, `max_p` remains unchanged, `a_values` and `b_values` remain unchanged, `nf`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and `custo` is appended to `custos`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, `custo` is the accumulated sum of `b_values[3]`, `b_values[2]`, `b_values[1]`, and `a_values[0]`, `custos` is a list that now includes the value of `custo`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
