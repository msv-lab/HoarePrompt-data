The given code snippet updates the `custo_pra_passar_b` variable by reading a new list of integers from the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is `c + 2`, `cases` is greater than `c + 2`, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a new list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers from the input, `total` is the accumulated sum of the smallest costs, `best` is the minimum cost found when `v <= pos_final`.**

In simpler terms, the `custo_pra_passar_b` list has been updated with new values from the input, while all other variables retain their previous values.
