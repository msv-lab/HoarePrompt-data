The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `na_frente` and `pos_final`. The values of `t` and `cases` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1; `na_frente` and `pos_final` are integers read from the input.**
