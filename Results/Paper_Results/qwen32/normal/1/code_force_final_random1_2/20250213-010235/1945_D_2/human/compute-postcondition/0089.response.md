Output State: **`c` is `c + 1`, `cases` is greater than `c + 1`, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1 (and is at least 0), `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Explanation: The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to it, where `v` is `na_frente - 2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
