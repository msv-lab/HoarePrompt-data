The only variable in the loop head is `c`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `c` and `cases`. If `c` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is some value (let's call it `x`), and `cases` is greater than `x`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `c` by 1. Therefore, if `c` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `c` should be `x + 1`. For the loop to continue executing, `cases` must be greater than `x + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `c` at the end of the last iteration, let's denote the new value of `c` as `c + 1` (assuming `c` was `c` at the end of the last iteration).

State: **`c` is `c + 1`, `cases` must be greater than `c + 1`**
