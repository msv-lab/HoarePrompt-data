To determine what will be printed by the `print(best)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the relevant variables:

- `c` is defined as `c + 2`. This means `c` has been incremented by 2 from its previous value, but without knowing the initial value of `c`, we cannot determine its exact current value.
- `cases` is greater than `c + 2`. This provides a condition about the relationship between `cases` and `c`, but it doesn't give us the exact value of either.
- `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1. This indicates that `na_frente` is derived from the first input integer.
- `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1. This indicates that `pos_final` is derived from the second input integer.
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input. These lists represent costs associated with certain actions or transitions.
- `total` is the accumulated minimum cost. This suggests that `total` is updated during some process to keep track of the lowest cost encountered.
- `best` is the smallest total cost encountered when `v <= pos_final`. This implies that `best` holds the minimum value of `total` under the condition that `v` (presumably a loop variable or index) is less than or equal to `pos_final`.

Given these descriptions, the value of `best` is dependent on the specific values of the input integers and the logic that updates `total` and checks the condition `v <= pos_final`. Without the actual input values and the logic that updates `total` and `best`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `best`.

However, we can describe the output precisely based on the information provided:

Output: **best (where best is the smallest total cost encountered when v <= pos_final)**
