Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, and `custo` is the accumulated sum of the smaller values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range `(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)`.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
        custo += b_values[y]
        if y == 1:
            custo += a_values[0]
            break
    else:
        custo += a_values[y]
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, and `custo` is the accumulated sum of the smaller values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range `(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` includes `b_values[y]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` includes `a_values[y]`. If `y` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, and `custo` is the accumulated sum of the smaller values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range `(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` includes `b_values[y]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` includes `a_values[y]`. If `y` is 2, `custo` is further incremented by either `b_values[2]` or `a_values[2]` depending on the condition, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is at least 2, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, and `y` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration + 1. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is incremented by `b_values[y]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` is incremented by `a_values[y]`. If `y` equals 1, `custo` is further incremented by `b_values[y]` and then by `a_values[0]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `custo` is incremented by `b_values[y]` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
