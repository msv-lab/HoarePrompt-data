Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, and `custo` is the accumulated sum of the smaller values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range `(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` includes `b_values[y]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` includes `a_values[y]`. If `y` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
