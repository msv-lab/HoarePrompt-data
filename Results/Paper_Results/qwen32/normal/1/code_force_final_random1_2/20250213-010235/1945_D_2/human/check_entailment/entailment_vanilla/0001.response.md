Let's analyze the provided Python code to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Kirill starts at the end of a queue of `n` people.
   - He wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
   - To move forward, Kirill can bribe someone in front of him.
     - Bribing the `i-th` person costs `a_i` coins.
     - Additionally, for every person between the bribed person and Kirill, he has to pay `b_k` coins.
   - We need to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions.

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - The code iterates from the last person in the queue to the first.
   - It maintains a running total of the cost (`total`) and keeps track of the best (minimum) cost found so far (`best`).
   - For each person, it checks if Kirill can reach the desired position (`v <= pos_final`).
     - If yes, it updates the `best` cost considering the cost to bribe that person.
     - It then adds either `a[v]` or `b[v]` to the `total` cost, depending on which is smaller.
   - If Kirill cannot reach the desired position, it still adds either `a[v]` or `b[v]` to the `total` cost, but does not update the `best` cost.

3. **Issues in the Code:**
   - The logic for updating the `total` cost is flawed. Specifically, adding `b[v]` to the `total` cost when Kirill cannot reach the desired position is incorrect. This is because `b[v]` represents the cost to pass through person `v`, which is irrelevant if Kirill is not moving past them.
   - The condition `if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:` is used to decide whether to add `a[v]` or `b[v]` to the `total`. However, this logic does not correctly account for the fact that `b[v]` should only be added when Kirill is moving past person `v`.
   - The initial value of `best` is set to a very large number (`10 ** 12`), which is fine, but the logic for updating `best` does not correctly handle all scenarios.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - A more appropriate approach would involve using a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position.
   - Alternatively, a dynamic programming approach could be used to calculate the minimum cost to reach each position.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the code's logic, it is clear that the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
