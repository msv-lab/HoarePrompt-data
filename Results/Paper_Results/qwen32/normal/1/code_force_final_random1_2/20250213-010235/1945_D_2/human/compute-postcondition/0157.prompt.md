Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, and `custo` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for y in a:
    a_values.append(int(y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer value of `y`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, and `custo` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer value of the previous `y` and the integer value of the current `y`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, `custo` is 0, `y` is the next element in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer value of the previous `y`, the integer value of the current `y`, and the integer value of the next `y`, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input and must have at least one more element after the current `y`, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, `custo` is 0, `y` is the next element in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
