The code snippet `a = input().split()` assigns the variable `a` the value of a list created by splitting the input string on whitespace. This affects the variable `a`, which was previously stated to remain unchanged, but now it holds the new list value.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` remains unchanged, and `custo` is 0.**
