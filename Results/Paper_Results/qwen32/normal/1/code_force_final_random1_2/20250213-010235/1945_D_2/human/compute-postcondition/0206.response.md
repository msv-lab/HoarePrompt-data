Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains unchanged, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is at least 2, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of substrings from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of substrings from the new input, and `y` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration + 1. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is incremented by `b_values[y]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` is incremented by `a_values[y]`. If `y` equals 1, `custo` is further incremented by `b_values[y]` and then by `a_values[0]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `custo` is incremented by `b_values[y]` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
