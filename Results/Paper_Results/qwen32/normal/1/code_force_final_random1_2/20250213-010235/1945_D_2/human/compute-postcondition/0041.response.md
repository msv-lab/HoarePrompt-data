Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `cases` is greater than or equal to 1; `na_frente` is an integer read from the input minus 1 (ensuring `na_frente` is at least 0); `pos_final` is an integer read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input; `v` is `v - 1`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is greater than the current `best`. Otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` and `best` remains unchanged if it was already greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**
