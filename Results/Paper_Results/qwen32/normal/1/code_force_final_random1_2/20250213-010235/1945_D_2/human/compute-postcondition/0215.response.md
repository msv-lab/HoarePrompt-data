Given the initial state, we know that `custos` is a list of integers with at least three integers. The variable `c` is specifically defined as the third element in the `custos` list. Since the exact values of the integers in `custos` are not provided, we can only describe `c` in terms of its position in the list.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `custos` is a list with at least three integers.
2. `c` is assigned the value of the third element in `custos`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the third element of the `custos` list.

Output: **c (where c is the third element in the custos list)**
