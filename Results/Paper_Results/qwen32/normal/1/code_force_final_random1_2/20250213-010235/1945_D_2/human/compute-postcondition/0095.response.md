The only variable in the loop head is `c`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `c` and `cases`. If `c` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is `c + 1`, and `cases` is greater than `c + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `c` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`c` is `c + 2`, `cases` is greater than `c + 2`, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input, `total` is the accumulated sum of the smallest costs, `best` is the minimum cost found when `v <= pos_final`**
