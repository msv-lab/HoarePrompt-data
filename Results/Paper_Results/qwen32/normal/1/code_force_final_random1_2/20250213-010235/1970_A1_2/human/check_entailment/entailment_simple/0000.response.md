### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

1. **Class Definition (`BalanceInfo`)**:
   - The class `BalanceInfo` is used to store the balance, position, and character of each prefix in the parentheses sequence. This is necessary for sorting the characters based on the prefix balance and position.

2. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The main function reads the input string `s`.
   - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects for each character in the string.
   - It iterates over each character in the string, updating the balance based on whether the character is '(' (increment balance) or ')' (decrement balance).
   - For each character, it appends a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info` with the current balance, position, and character.
   - After constructing the list of `BalanceInfo` objects, it sorts them using a custom key: primarily by `balance` in ascending order, and secondarily by `position` in descending order (achieved by negating the position).
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list and prints the result.

3. **Sorting Logic (`func_1`)**:
   - The sorting logic is implemented within the `key` parameter of the `sort` method in `func_2`. The lambda function `(x.balance, -x.position)` ensures that the sorting criteria match the problem statement: first by balance in ascending order, and then by position in descending order when balances are equal.

4. **Output**:
   - The output is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list. According to the problem statement, this should produce the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

### Verification with Example:
Given the input `(()(()))`, the program will:
- Calculate the prefix balances and positions:
  - Prefix balance: 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1
  - Positions: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
  - Characters: '(', '(', ')', '(', '(', ')', ')', ')'
- Sort these based on the criteria:
  - Sorted Prefix balance: 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3
  - Sorted Positions: 0, 7, 3, 1, 6, 4, 2, 5
  - Sorted Characters: '(', ')', '(', '(', ')', '(', ')', ')'
- Join the sorted characters to form the output: `()(()())`

This matches the expected output, confirming that the program works correctly for this example.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
