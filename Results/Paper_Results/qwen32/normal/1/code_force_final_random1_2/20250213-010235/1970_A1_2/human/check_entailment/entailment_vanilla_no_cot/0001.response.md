To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the code step-by-step against the problem requirements.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to perform a "balanced shuffle" on a given balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle involves creating a table of prefix balances and positions, sorting it according to specific rules, and then forming a new sequence from the sorted table.

2. **Code Breakdown:**
   - The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is intended to be a comparator function but is not used directly in the provided code. It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position.
   - `func_2` performs the main logic:
     - It calculates the prefix balance for each character in the input string.
     - It stores these values along with the character's position in a list of `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - It sorts these objects first by balance in ascending order and then by position in descending order (using `-x.position`).
     - It constructs the final shuffled sequence by joining the characters from the sorted list.

3. **Logic Verification:**
   - The sorting criteria match the problem statement: sort by prefix balance in increasing order and break ties by position in decreasing order.
   - The final sequence is constructed correctly by joining the characters from the sorted list of `BalanceInfo`.

4. **Edge Cases Considered:**
   - The program handles sequences of varying lengths, including the maximum length specified (500,000).
   - It assumes the input is always a balanced parentheses sequence, as per the problem statement.

5. **Implementation Details:**
   - The use of a custom class `BalanceInfo` to store balance, position, and character information is appropriate.
   - The sorting key lambda function `(x.balance, -x.position)` correctly implements the required sorting order.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It calculates the prefix balances, sorts them according to the specified rules, and constructs the output sequence accurately.

**Correctness:** **True**
