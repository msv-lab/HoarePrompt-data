The code snippet `balance += 1` increments the value of the variable `balance` by 1. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `balance_info`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the updated state would reflect the increment in `balance`. Since the exact value of `balance` before the increment is not specified, we denote it as `balance + 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing three `BalanceInfo` objects (two from the initial state plus the newly appended one); `i` is `i + 1`; `balance` is `balance + 1`.**
