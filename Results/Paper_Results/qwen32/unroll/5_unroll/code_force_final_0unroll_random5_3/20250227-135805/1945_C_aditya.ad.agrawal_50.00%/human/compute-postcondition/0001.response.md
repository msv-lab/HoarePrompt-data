The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is described as "an input integer representing the number of test cases," which does not inherently ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, `t` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
