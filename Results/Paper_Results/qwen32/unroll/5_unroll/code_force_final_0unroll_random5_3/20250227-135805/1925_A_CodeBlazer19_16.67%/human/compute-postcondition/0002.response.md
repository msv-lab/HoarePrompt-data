To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop for each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Outer Loop (`for i in range(t)`):**
   - This loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Inner Loop (`for j in range(97, k + 97)`):**
   - This loop constructs a string `s` by appending characters from ASCII value 97 ('a') up to `k + 96` (which corresponds to the `k`-th letter of the alphabet).
   - For example, if `k = 3`, `s` will be 'abc'.

3. **Conditional Logic:**
   - If `k == 1`, it prints `n * s`. This means it prints the string `s` repeated `n` times.
   - Otherwise, it prints `(2 - (n == 1)) * s`. This means:
     - If `n == 1`, it prints `s` once.
     - If `n > 1`, it prints `s` twice.

Given the initial state, the output for each test case will be printed immediately within the loop. Therefore, there is no cumulative state stored in any variables outside the loop that needs to be described in the final output state.

The output state, therefore, is simply the series of printed strings for each test case, which are determined by the values of `n` and `k` for each iteration.

Since the output is printed immediately and there are no variables outside the loop that are modified and need to be described in the final state, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **The output consists of `t` lines, each being the string `s` repeated a certain number of times based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.**
