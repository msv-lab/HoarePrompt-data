Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 676, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to an integer input by the user, which is within the specified range of 1 to 676. The conditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.
