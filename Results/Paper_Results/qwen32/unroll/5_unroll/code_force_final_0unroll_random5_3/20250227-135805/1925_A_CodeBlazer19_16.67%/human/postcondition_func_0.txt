The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a string `s` of length `k` using the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet. It then prints the string `s` repeated a number of times based on the values of `n` and `k`: if `k` is 1, it prints `s` repeated `n` times; otherwise, it prints `s` repeated `1` time if `n` is 1, or `2` times if `n` is greater than 1.
