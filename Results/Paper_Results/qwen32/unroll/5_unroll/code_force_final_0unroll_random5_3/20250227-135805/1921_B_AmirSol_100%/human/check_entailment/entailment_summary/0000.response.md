### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of the boxes (represented by the string `s1`) to the desired state (represented by the string `s2`). The allowed operations are:
1. Adding a cat to an empty box.
2. Removing a cat from a box.
3. Moving a cat from one box to another.

The provided program calculates the number of '0's in `s1` that need to be turned into '1's (i.e., `cats_to_add`) and the number of '1's in `s1` that need to be turned into '0's (i.e., `cats_to_remove`). The key insight is that:
- Each addition or removal operation can independently address one '0' to '1' or '1' to '0' change.
- Each move operation can simultaneously address one '0' to '1' and one '1' to '0' change.

Thus, the minimum number of operations required is the maximum of `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove` because any move operation can handle one '0' to '1' and one '1' to '0' simultaneously, and any remaining unmatched changes (whether they are '0's that need to become '1's or '1's that need to become '0's) will require separate operations.

The provided function correctly implements this logic.
