Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of sticks and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the exponents for the lengths of the sticks. The length of the i-th stick is calculated as 2 raised to the power of `a_i`. The function returns the number of ways to select three sticks that can form a triangle for each test case.**
