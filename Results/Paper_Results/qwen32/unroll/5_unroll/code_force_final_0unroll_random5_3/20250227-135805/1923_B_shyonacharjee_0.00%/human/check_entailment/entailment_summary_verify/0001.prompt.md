You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of monsters `n`, a maximum number of bullets `k`, a list of monster healths, and a list of their positions. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to defeat all monsters using the bullets within the time constraints based on their positions and healths, and prints 'YES' if possible, otherwise 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the logic and compare it with the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of monsters) and `k` (maximum bullets per second).
   - It then reads the list of healths `a_i` and positions `x_i` for the monsters.

2. **Sorting Monsters:**
   - The program sorts the monsters based on the absolute value of their positions (`abs(x_i)`). This is a good approach because it prioritizes monsters that are closer to the player, minimizing the risk of them reaching the player before they can be killed.

3. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program initializes `total_bullets_used` to 0 and `success` to `True`.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of monsters.
   - For each monster, it calculates the `distance` as the absolute value of its position.
   - It calculates the `time_available` as the `distance` (since the monster can move one step per second).
   - It calculates the `bullets_needed` as the health of the monster.
   - It checks if the total bullets used so far plus the bullets needed for the current monster exceed the time available. If they do, it sets `success` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without setting `success` to `False`, it prints "YES", indicating that it's possible to kill all monsters before they reach the player. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Bullets Limit (`k`):** The program does not consider the limit `k` on the number of bullets that can be fired per second. This is a critical oversight because it might be impossible to kill a monster if its health is greater than `k` even if there is enough time available. The program should ensure that it does not attempt to fire more than `k` bullets in any second.
- **Time Available Calculation:** The program correctly calculates `time_available` as the distance, which is the number of seconds the monster has before it reaches the player. However, it does not account for the fact that the player can only fire up to `k` bullets per second. This means that even if `time_available` is greater than `bullets_needed`, the player might not be able to kill the monster if `bullets_needed` is greater than `k`.
- **Accumulated Bullets:** The program uses `total_bullets_used` to keep track of the total bullets used across all monsters. However, it does not reset this counter for each second, which is necessary to ensure that no more than `k` bullets are fired in any single second. The program should instead track the number of bullets used in the current second and reset it when necessary.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues highlighted above, the program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the limit on the number of bullets that can be fired per second (`k`). The program needs to be modified to ensure that it does not attempt to fire more than `k` bullets in any second and to correctly track the number of bullets used per second.
