The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and two lists of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n`. The constraints specify that `1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4` for the number of test cases, `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9` for each test case, `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9` for each element in the first list, and `-n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ... < x_n ≤ n` with `x_i ≠ 0` for each element in the second list. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `3 · 10^5`.

The function processes each test case and returns a value based on the provided inputs. The specific return value is not detailed in the provided output description, but it is implied that the function computes and returns a result for each test case.
