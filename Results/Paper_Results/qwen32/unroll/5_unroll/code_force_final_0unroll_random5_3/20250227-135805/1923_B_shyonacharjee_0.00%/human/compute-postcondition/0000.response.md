Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 3 · 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2 · 10^9. `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for each `i`. `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` are integers such that -n ≤ `x_1` < `x_2` < `x_3` < ... < `x_n` ≤ n and `x_i` ≠ 0 for each `i`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

In simple terms: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the input integer, which represents the number of test cases. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a_i`, `x_i`) and their constraints remain unchanged as they have not been modified by the code snippet provided.
