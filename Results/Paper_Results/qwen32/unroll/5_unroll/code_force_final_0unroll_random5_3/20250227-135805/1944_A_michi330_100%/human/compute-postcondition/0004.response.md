Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of islands (`n`) and the maximum number of bridges (`k`) that can be destroyed. For each test case, it outputs `1` if the number of bridges that can be destroyed is at least `n - 1`; otherwise, it outputs `n`.**
