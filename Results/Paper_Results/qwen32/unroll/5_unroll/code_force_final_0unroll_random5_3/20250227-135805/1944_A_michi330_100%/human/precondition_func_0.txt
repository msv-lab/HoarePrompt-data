The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2) representing the number of islands and the maximum number of bridges Dominater can destroy, respectively.
