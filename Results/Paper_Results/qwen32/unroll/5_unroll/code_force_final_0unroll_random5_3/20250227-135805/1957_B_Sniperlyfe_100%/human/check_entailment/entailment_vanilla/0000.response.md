Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Objective Understanding**:
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence.
   - `func_1` initializes a list `nums` of `n` zeros.
   - It sets the first element of `nums` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`.
   - It then subtracts this value from `k` and distributes the remaining `k` among the rest of the elements in `nums`.
   - Finally, it adds any remaining `k` to the first element.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - The strategy of setting the first element to a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k` is intended to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
   - However, the program does not guarantee that the distribution of the remaining `k` among the other elements will maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
   - For example, if `k` is 5 and `n` is 2, the program might output `3 2` (binary `11` and `10`), which has three 1s in the bitwise OR. But a better solution would be `1 4` (binary `01` and `100`), which also sums to 5 but has four 1s in the bitwise OR.
   - The program does not consider distributing `k` in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR for all elements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not guarantee that the sequence generated maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, it is not correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
