Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `nums` is a list of `n` zeros with `nums[0]` set to `2^(k.bit_length()) - 1`. `k` is decreased by `nums[0]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` is reduced by `2^(k.bit_length()) - 1`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
