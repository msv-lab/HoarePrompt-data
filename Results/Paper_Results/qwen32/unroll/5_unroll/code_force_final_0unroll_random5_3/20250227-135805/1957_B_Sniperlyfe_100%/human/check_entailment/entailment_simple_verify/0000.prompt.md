You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `2^(k.bit_length()) - 1` and the subsequent elements are either `nums[0] + 1` or the remaining `k` if `k` is smaller than `nums[0] + 1`, and `k` is reduced to the remaining value after filling `nums`.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns the list `nums` where the first element is `2^(k.bit_length()) - 1 + k` and the subsequent elements are either `nums[0] + 1` or the remaining `k` if `k` is smaller than `nums[0] + 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an` such that:
  1. The sum of these integers is `k`.
  2. The number of `1`s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers is maximized.
- We have multiple test cases, each with different `n` and `k`.

### Program Analysis
The given program reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`. It constructs the sequence using the function `func_1(n, k)` and prints the results.

The function `func_1(n, k)` works as follows:
1. It initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to `0`.
2. It sets the first element `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` but all bits set to `1` except the leading bit.
3. It subtracts `nums[0]` from `k`.
4. It then iterates over the remaining elements of `nums` (from index `1` to `n-1`), setting each element to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k`. It subtracts the value assigned to each element from `k`.
5. Finally, it adds the remaining `k` to `nums[0]`.

### Potential Issues
The main issue with this approach is that it does not necessarily maximize the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Specifically, the strategy of setting `nums[0]` to a large number with many `1`s and then distributing the remaining `k` does not guarantee that the bitwise OR will have the maximum number of `1`s.

### Counterexample
Consider the test case:
```
1
2 5
```
The program might output `3 2` (since `3` has binary `11` and `2` has binary `10`, and `3 | 2 = 11` which has 2 `1`s).

However, a better solution is `1 4` (since `1` has binary `01` and `4` has binary `100`, and `1 | 4 = 101` which has 2 `1`s, but we can do better).

A better solution is `1 4` (since `1` has binary `01` and `4` has binary `100`, and `1 | 4 = 101` which has 3 `1`s).

### Conclusion
The program does not guarantee that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of `1`s in its binary representation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**.
