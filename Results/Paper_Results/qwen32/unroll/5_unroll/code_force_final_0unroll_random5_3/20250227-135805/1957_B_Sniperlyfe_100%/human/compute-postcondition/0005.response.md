The code snippet `nums[0] += k` increments the first element of the list `nums` by the value of `k`. This means that the value of `nums[0]` which was initially `2^(k.bit_length()) - 1` is now `2^(k.bit_length()) - 1 + k`. The subsequent elements of `nums` and the value of `k` remain unchanged according to the provided initial state.

Output State: **`nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `2^(k.bit_length()) - 1 + k` and the subsequent elements are either `nums[0] + 1` or the remaining `k` if `k` is smaller than `nums[0] + 1`, and `k` is reduced to the remaining value after filling `nums`.**
