You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `2^(k.bit_length()) - 1` and the subsequent elements are either `nums[0] + 1` or the remaining `k` if `k` is smaller than `nums[0] + 1`, and `k` is reduced to the remaining value after filling `nums`.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns the list `nums` where the first element is `2^(k.bit_length()) - 1 + k` and the subsequent elements are either `nums[0] + 1` or the remaining `k` if `k` is smaller than `nums[0] + 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
Given integers `n` and `k`, we need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` that:
1. Sum up to `k` (i.e., \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i = k\)).
2. Maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence (i.e., maximize the number of 1s in `a_1 | a_2 | ... | a_n`).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads `t` test cases, where each test case consists of `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, k)` to generate a sequence of `n` numbers that sum to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in their bitwise OR.

Let's break down the `func_1(n, k)` function:
1. **Initialization:** It initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
2. **First Element Assignment:** It sets the first element `nums[0]` to \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1\). This value is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` minus 1, which means it has a binary representation consisting of all 1s up to the highest bit of `k`.
3. **Adjusting `k`:** It subtracts `nums[0]` from `k`.
4. **Filling Remaining Elements:** It iterates over the remaining elements of `nums` and assigns each element the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` or the remaining `k`. It then subtracts the assigned value from `k`.
5. **Final Adjustment:** It adds the remaining `k` to the first element `nums[0]`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Sum Condition:** The sequence is constructed such that the sum of all elements equals `k`. The initial assignment to `nums[0]` and subsequent adjustments ensure that the final sum is `k`.
- **Maximizing 1s in Bitwise OR:** The strategy of setting the first element to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` minus 1 aims to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation. However, this approach does not necessarily guarantee the optimal solution because it does not consider the optimal distribution of bits across all elements to maximize the number of 1s in their bitwise OR.

### Example:
Let's consider the fourth test case from the example:
- `n = 6`, `k = 51`
- The program sets `nums[0]` to \((1 << 6) - 1 = 63\), but since `k = 51`, it adjusts `nums[0]` to 51 and sets the rest of the elements to 0.
- This results in `nums = [51, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, which sums to 51 but does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. The correct sequence could be `[3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12]` as shown in the example output.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always produce a sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, it does not fully solve the problem as described.
