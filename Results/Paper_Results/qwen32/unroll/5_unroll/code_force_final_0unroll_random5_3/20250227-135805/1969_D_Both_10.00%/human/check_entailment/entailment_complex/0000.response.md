### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to calculate Alice's optimal profit based on the described game scenario between Alice and Bob. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and whether it correctly implements the solution:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_2` reads the number of items `n` and the number of free items `k` for each test case, followed by two lines of integers representing the prices for Alice and Bob.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program creates a list of tuples `arr` where each tuple contains the negative of Alice's price and Bob's price for each item.
   - The list `arr` is sorted based on Bob's prices in ascending order.
   - A heap `k_arr` is used to keep track of the `k` items that Bob will take for free. The heap is initialized with the `k` items with the highest Alice prices (since they are stored as negative values).

3. **Calculating Profit:**
   - The initial `sub_sum` is calculated using `func_3`, which sums the Alice prices in `k_arr` and adds the sum of the elements in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is non-negative.
   - The program then iterates over the remaining items in `arr` (items not initially considered for free by Bob). For each item, it updates `sub_sum` by removing the price of the item and adding the price of the item if it is beneficial to do so (i.e., if the sum of the item's prices is non-negative).
   - During each iteration, the heap `k_arr` is updated to ensure it always contains the `k` items with the highest Alice prices (again, stored as negative values).

4. **Maximizing Profit:**
   - The program keeps track of the maximum profit encountered during the iterations and prints this value as the result for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Sorting and Heap Usage:** The sorting step ensures that Bob takes the items with the lowest prices for himself, minimizing Alice's profit. The heap usage ensures that Bob takes the `k` items with the highest prices for Alice, which also minimizes Alice's profit.
- **Profit Calculation:** The logic for calculating the profit considers both the items Bob takes for free and the items he buys from Alice, ensuring that Alice's profit is maximized given Bob's optimal strategy.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases such as when `k = 0` (Bob takes all items for free) and when all items have non-positive combined prices (Alice does not buy any items).

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate Alice's optimal profit based on the problem description. The use of sorting and a heap ensures that both Alice and Bob act optimally according to the rules of the game.

**Correctness: True**
