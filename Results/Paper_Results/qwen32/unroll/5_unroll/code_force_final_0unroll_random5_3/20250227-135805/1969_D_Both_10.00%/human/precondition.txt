t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each i. b_1, b_2, ..., b_n are integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
