Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` where `2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4` and `1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋`, and a list of `2n` integers `a` where each integer from 1 to `n` occurs exactly twice. The function returns an integer representing the maximum number of pairs `(a_i, a_j)` that can be formed such that `a_i` and `a_j` are equal and the indices `i` and `j` are at most `k` positions apart.**
