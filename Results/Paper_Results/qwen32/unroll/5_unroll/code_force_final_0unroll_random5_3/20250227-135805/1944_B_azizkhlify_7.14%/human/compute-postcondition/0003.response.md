Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `2n` integers `a` where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. It prints pairs of equal integers from the list, ensuring that the indices of the pairs are at most `k` positions apart. After printing such pairs from the first half of the list, it prints additional pairs from the second half if needed to balance the output.**
