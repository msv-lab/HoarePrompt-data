Precondition: **Each test case consists of two integers n and k where 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^4.**
