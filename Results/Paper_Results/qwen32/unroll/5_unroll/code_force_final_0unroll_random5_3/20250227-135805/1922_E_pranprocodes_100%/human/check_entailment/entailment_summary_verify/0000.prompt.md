You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    0 1 0
    5
    2 2 3 4 2
    7
    -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        max = 100000000
        min = -100000000
        ans = []
        t = 0
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        ans.reverse()
        print(t)
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `X` (2 <= X <= 10^18). For each test case, it calculates the number of iterations required to reduce `X` to 1 using a specific set of operations and generates a sequence of numbers corresponding to those operations. The function outputs the number of iterations and the sequence for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with exactly X increasing subsequences for every potential case, as required by the problem description. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Handling of X:**
   - The code attempts to generate an array by repeatedly dividing X by 2 and subtracting 1 when X is odd. This approach does not ensure that the final array will have exactly X increasing subsequences.
   - The logic for generating the array is flawed and does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle small values of X correctly. For example, for X = 2, the code might not generate an array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences.
   - The code does not handle large values of X correctly either. For example, for X = 13, the code might not generate an array with exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

3. **General Approach:**
   - The problem requires a specific construction of the array to ensure the exact number of increasing subsequences. The current approach does not follow any known algorithm or method to achieve this.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:

Let's consider the input X = 2:

- The code might generate an array like `[0]` or `[100000000]`, which does not have exactly 2 increasing subsequences.
- The correct output for X = 2 should be an array like `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing both elements.

### Conclusion:

The current implementation does not correctly generate an array with exactly X increasing subsequences for all possible values of X. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
