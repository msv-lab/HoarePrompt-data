Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find an array of integers such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The array can have a length of at most 200. If no such array exists, the output should be `-1`.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by repeatedly dividing `X` by 2 if `X` is even or subtracting 1 if `X` is odd, appending either a maximum or minimum value to the array `ans` respectively. The idea seems to be to construct an array that results in exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

However, let's consider the correctness of this approach:

1. **Base Case**: When `X = 1`, there is only one increasing subsequence, which is the empty subsequence. The solution correctly handles this by stopping the loop when `X` becomes 1.

2. **Even `X`**: If `X` is even, the solution appends the current maximum value to the array and decrements `X` by half. This operation is supposed to split the subsequences into two equal parts, but it does not guarantee that the resulting subsequences are strictly increasing.

3. **Odd `X`**: If `X` is odd, the solution appends the current minimum value to the array and decrements `X` by 1. This operation is supposed to handle the remaining subsequence, but again, it does not guarantee that the resulting subsequences are strictly increasing.

4. **Strictly Increasing Subsequences**: The problem requires the subsequences to be strictly increasing. The provided solution does not ensure that the generated array will have strictly increasing subsequences.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

- **For `X = 2`**: The solution outputs `1` and `[0]`. This is incorrect because `[0]` has only one increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence and `[0]` itself), not two.

- **For `X = 5`**: The solution outputs `3` and `[0, 1, 0]`. This is incorrect because `[0, 1, 0]` does not have exactly 5 increasing subsequences.

- **For `X = 13`**: The solution outputs `5` and `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]`. This is incorrect because `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` does not have exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

- **For `X = 37`**: The solution outputs `7` and `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]`. This is incorrect because `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` does not have exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion

The provided solution does not correctly generate an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The approach does not ensure that the subsequences are strictly increasing, and the generated arrays do not match the required number of increasing subsequences.

### Final Answer

Reasoning: The provided solution does not correctly generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The approach does not ensure that the subsequences are strictly increasing, and the generated arrays do not match the required number of increasing subsequences.

Correctness: **False**
