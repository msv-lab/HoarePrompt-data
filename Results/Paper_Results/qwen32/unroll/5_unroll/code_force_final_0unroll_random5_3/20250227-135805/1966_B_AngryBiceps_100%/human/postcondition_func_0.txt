The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with characters 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it determines whether the grid meets specific conditions: if the first and last rows are identical and consist of the same character, or if the first and last columns are identical and consist of the same character. If either condition is true, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'.
