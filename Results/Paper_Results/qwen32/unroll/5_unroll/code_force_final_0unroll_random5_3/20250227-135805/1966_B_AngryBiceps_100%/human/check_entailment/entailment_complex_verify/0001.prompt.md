You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

    #State: The output state consists of t lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO', based on the conditions specified in the loop for each test case. The variable t remains unchanged, and for each of the t test cases, the variables n, m, a, first_row, and last_row are recalculated and used to determine the output for that test case without affecting the state of t or any other variables outside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with characters 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it determines whether the grid meets specific conditions: if the first and last rows are identical and consist of the same character, or if the first and last columns are identical and consist of the same character. If either condition is true, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operation. The operation allows selecting two squares of the same color and coloring the entire subrectangle between them to that color.

### Key Observations

1. **Single Color Rows and Columns**: If there is a row or column that is entirely one color and different from another row or column that is entirely one color, it is impossible to make the whole grid the same color. This is because the operation can only change the color of a subrectangle, and it cannot mix colors from different rows or columns into the same subrectangle.

2. **General Case**: If there is no such pair of rows or columns, it is possible to make the entire grid the same color. This can be achieved by progressively expanding a subrectangle of one color to cover the entire grid.

### Program Analysis

The program checks two conditions:
1. If the first and last rows are entirely one color and different from each other.
2. If the first and last columns are entirely one color and different from each other.

If either of these conditions is true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if the program correctly implements the logic described above:

- **Condition 1**: `len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and (a[0] != a[-1])`
  - This checks if the first row and the last row are entirely one color and different from each other.
  - If true, it means there is a row at the start and a row at the end that are entirely one color and different, making it impossible to make the grid uniform.

- **Condition 2**: `len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and (first_row != last_row)`
  - This checks if the first column and the last column are entirely one color and different from each other.
  - If true, it means there is a column at the start and a column at the end that are entirely one color and different, making it impossible to make the grid uniform.

- If neither of these conditions is true, it prints "YES", which means it is possible to make the grid uniform.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the entire grid the same color. It checks the necessary conditions and provides the correct output based on those conditions.

Correctness: **True**
