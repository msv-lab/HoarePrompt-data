Let's analyze the given Python program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operation. The operation allows selecting two squares of the same color and coloring the entire subrectangle between them to that color.

### Key Observations

1. **Single Color Rows and Columns**: If there is a row or column that is entirely one color and different from another row or column that is entirely one color, it is impossible to make the whole grid the same color. This is because the operation can only change the color of a subrectangle, and it cannot mix colors from different rows or columns into the same subrectangle.

2. **General Case**: If there is no such pair of rows or columns, it is possible to make the entire grid the same color. This can be achieved by progressively expanding a subrectangle of one color to cover the entire grid.

### Program Analysis

The program checks two conditions:
1. If the first and last rows are entirely one color and different from each other.
2. If the first and last columns are entirely one color and different from each other.

If either of these conditions is true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if the program correctly implements the logic described above:

- **Condition 1**: `len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and (a[0] != a[-1])`
  - This checks if the first row and the last row are entirely one color and different from each other.
  - If true, it means there is a row at the start and a row at the end that are entirely one color and different, making it impossible to make the grid uniform.

- **Condition 2**: `len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and (first_row != last_row)`
  - This checks if the first column and the last column are entirely one color and different from each other.
  - If true, it means there is a column at the start and a column at the end that are entirely one color and different, making it impossible to make the grid uniform.

- If neither of these conditions is true, it prints "YES", which means it is possible to make the grid uniform.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the entire grid the same color. It checks the necessary conditions and provides the correct output based on those conditions.

Correctness: **True**
