Output State: **The output state consists of t lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO', based on the conditions specified in the loop for each test case. The variable t remains unchanged, and for each of the t test cases, the variables n, m, a, first_row, and last_row are recalculated and used to determine the output for that test case without affecting the state of t or any other variables outside the loop.**
