### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using a specific operation. The operation allows selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by checking the following conditions:
1. If the first row and the last row of the grid are the same color (all 'W' or all 'B'), and they are different from each other, it prints "NO".
2. If the first column and the last column of the grid are the same color (all 'W' or all 'B'), and they are different from each other, it prints "NO".
3. Otherwise, it prints "YES".

This approach works because if the first row and the last row are different and both are uniform in color, it's impossible to change the color of the squares in between to match one of the rows. The same logic applies to the first and last columns. If both these conditions are not met, it means that there is a way to make all squares the same color through a series of operations.

Let's verify this with the provided examples:

1. **First Example:**
   ```
   2 1
   W
   B
   ```
   - First row: "W"
   - Last row: "B"
   - Both rows are uniform but different, so the output is "NO".

2. **Second Example:**
   ```
   6 6
   WWWWBW
   WBWWWW
   BBBWWW
   BWWWBB
   WWBWBB
   BBBWBW
   ```
   - First row: "WWWWBW"
   - Last row: "BBBWBW"
   - First column: "WBWBWB"
   - Last column: "WBWBWB"
   - Neither the first and last rows nor the first and last columns are uniform and different, so the output is "YES".

3. **Third Example:**
   ```
   1 1
   W
   ```
   - Single cell grid, so the output is "YES".

4. **Fourth Example:**
   ```
   2 2
   BB
   BB
   ```
   - Both rows and columns are uniform and the same, so the output is "YES".

5. **Fifth Example:**
   ```
   3 4
   BWBW
   WBWB
   BWBW
   ```
   - Neither the first and last rows nor the first and last columns are uniform and different, so the output is "YES".

6. **Sixth Example:**
   ```
   4 2
   BB
   BB
   WW
   WW
   ```
   - First row: "BB"
   - Last row: "WW"
   - Both rows are uniform but different, so the output is "NO".

7. **Seventh Example:**
   ```
   4 4
   WWBW
   BBWB
   WWBB
   BBBB
   ```
   - Neither the first and last rows nor the first and last columns are uniform and different, so the output is "YES".

8. **Eighth Example:**
   ```
   1 5
   WBBWB
   ```
   - First row: "WBBWB"
   - First column: "W"
   - Last column: "B"
   - Neither the first and last rows nor the first and last columns are uniform and different, so the output is "NO".

The program correctly handles all these cases as per the logic described.

### Correctness: **True**
