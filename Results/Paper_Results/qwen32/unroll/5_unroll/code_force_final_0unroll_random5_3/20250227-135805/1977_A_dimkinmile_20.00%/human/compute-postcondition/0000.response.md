Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100; `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input.**

Natural Language: The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is still an integer between 1 and 100. The values of `n` and `m` are now assigned the integers provided in the input, where both `n` and `m` are between 1 and 100.
