### Reasoning:
The program is designed to solve the problem by reading multiple test cases, sorting the list of integers in each test case, and then selecting every second element (starting from the first) to add to the score. The logic behind selecting every second element after sorting is that this will maximize the sum of the minimums of the pairs, as the smallest elements will be paired together.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's approach:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (which is the number of pairs).
   - It then reads the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The list of integers is split into a list `list1` and then sorted.
   - It then iterates over the sorted list, selecting every second element starting from the first (i.e., indices `0, 2, 4, ...`). These elements are added to `list2`.
   - The sum of the elements in `list2` is appended to the `out` list.

3. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the sums for each test case.

### Correctness:
The strategy of sorting the list and then selecting every second element is optimal because it ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, thus maximizing the sum of the minimums of the pairs. This aligns with the problem's requirement to find the maximum final score.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
