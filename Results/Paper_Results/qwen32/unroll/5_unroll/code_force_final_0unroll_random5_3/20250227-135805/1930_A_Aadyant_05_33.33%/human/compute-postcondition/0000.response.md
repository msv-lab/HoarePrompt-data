The code provided only includes `num = input()`, which reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `num`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `a` as they were defined in the initial state. The input read into `num` is a string, not an integer, unless further conversion is done.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7; `num` is a string read from input.**
