### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. The strategy to maximize the score is to always pair the smallest available numbers together. This ensures that the sum of the minimums of the pairs is maximized.

Hereâ€™s how the provided program works:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers.
4. It then iterates through the sorted list, selecting every other element starting from the first one (which are the smallest elements due to sorting).
5. It sums these selected elements, which represent the minimum values of the pairs.
6. It prints the sum for each test case.

This approach is optimal because sorting the list ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together, thereby maximizing the score.

### Execution Summary:
The execution summary confirms that the program reads inputs correctly, sorts the list of integers, and sums every other element from the sorted list. This matches the optimal strategy described above.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by pairing the smallest available numbers together and summing the minimums of those pairs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
