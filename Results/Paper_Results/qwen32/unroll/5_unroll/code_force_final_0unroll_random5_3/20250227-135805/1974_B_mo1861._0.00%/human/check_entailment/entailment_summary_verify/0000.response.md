Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Encoding Process**:
  1. Construct a new auxiliary string `r` which consists of all distinct letters of the string `s`, written in alphabetical order.
  2. Replace each character in the string `s` by its symmetric character from the string `r` (the first character of `r` will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on).

- **Decoding Process**:
  - Given an encoded string `b`, restore the original string `s` by reversing the encoding process.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program includes a function `func_1` that attempts to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`.

#### Function `func_1` Implementation
```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
        char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

#### Function Summary
- The function `func_1` takes a string `b` and returns a new string `s` where each unique character in `b` is replaced by a unique character from 'z' to 'a', mapping the lexicographically smallest character in `b` to 'z', the next smallest to 'y', and so on.

### Issues in the Provided Program
1. **Incorrect Mapping**:
   - The program maps each unique character in `b` to a character in the range 'a' to 'z' based on the length of `b`. This is incorrect because it does not match the encoding process described in the problem.
   - The problem requires that each character in the string `b` should be replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of `b` in alphabetical order.

2. **Incorrect Symmetric Mapping**:
   - The program does not create the string `r` as described in the problem, which is the sorted set of characters in `b`.
   - It also does not map each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`.

### Corrected Implementation
The correct implementation should:
1. Create the string `r` by sorting the unique characters in `b`.
2. Map each character in the reversed string `r` to the corresponding character in `r`.
3. Use this mapping to decode the string `b`.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(b))
    r = distinct_chars[::-1]  # Reverse the sorted distinct characters
    char_map = {r[i]: distinct_chars[i] for i in range(len(distinct_chars))}
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly decode the string as per the problem description. The issues lie in the incorrect mapping and the lack of symmetric character replacement based on the string `r`.

**Final: False**
