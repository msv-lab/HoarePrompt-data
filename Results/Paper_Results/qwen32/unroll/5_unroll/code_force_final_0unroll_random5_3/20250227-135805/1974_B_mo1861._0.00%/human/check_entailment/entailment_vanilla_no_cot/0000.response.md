Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the mapping of characters. The current implementation incorrectly maps each character in the sorted set of `b` to a character starting from 'a'. Instead, it should map each character to its symmetric counterpart from the sorted set of `b`. Here's the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    # Create a sorted list of unique characters in b
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    # Create a mapping from each character to its symmetric counterpart
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    # Decode the string b using the mapping
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    return s
```

With this correction, the program should correctly decode the encoded string `b` to the original string `s`.
