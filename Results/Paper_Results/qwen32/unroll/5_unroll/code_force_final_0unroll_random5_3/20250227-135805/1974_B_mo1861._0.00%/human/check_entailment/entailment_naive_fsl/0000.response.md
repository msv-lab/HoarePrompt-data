Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the string as per the problem description. The main issue lies in the way the `char_map` is constructed. The problem requires that each character in the string `b` should be replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of `b` in alphabetical order. However, the current implementation incorrectly maps each character in `b` to a character in the range `a` to `z` based on the length of `b`, which is not what the problem requires.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(b))
    r = distinct_chars[::-1]  # Reverse the sorted distinct characters
    char_map = {r[i]: distinct_chars[i] for i in range(len(distinct_chars))}
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

In this corrected version, `distinct_chars` is the list of distinct characters in `b` sorted in alphabetical order. `r` is the reversed version of `distinct_chars`. The `char_map` is then constructed such that each character in `r` (which is the encoded character) maps to the corresponding character in `distinct_chars` (which is the original character). This ensures that the decoding is done correctly as per the problem description.
