You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of b is a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). The function `func_1` is called once for each test case, and the number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings b across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
        char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
        
    #State: `char_map` is a dictionary mapping each unique character in `b` to a character in the range from 'a' to 'z', starting from 'z' and moving downwards in descending order based on the sorted order of the unique characters in `b`.
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    #State: `s` is a string where each character in the original string `b` has been replaced by its corresponding character from `char_map`, which maps unique characters in `b` to characters from 'z' to 'a' in descending order based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`. The `char_map` remains unchanged.
    #
    #Output State:
    return s
    #The program returns the string `s` where each character in the original string `b` has been replaced by its corresponding character from `char_map`, which maps unique characters in `b` to characters from 'z' to 'a' in descending order based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a new string `s` where each character in `b` is replaced by its corresponding character from `char_map`. The `char_map` maps unique characters in `b` to characters from 'z' to 'a' in descending order based on the sorted order of the unique characters in `b`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the string `s` where each character in the original string `b` has been replaced by its corresponding character from `char_map`, which maps unique characters in `b` to characters from 'z' to 'a' in descending order based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
