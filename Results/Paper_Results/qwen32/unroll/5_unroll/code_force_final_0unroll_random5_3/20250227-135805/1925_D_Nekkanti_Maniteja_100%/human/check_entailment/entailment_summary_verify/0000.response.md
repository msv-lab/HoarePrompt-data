Let's analyze the provided Python program and the function summary in detail to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Recap
The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions. The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers, and the final result should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

### Program Analysis
The code provided is as follows:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

### Function Summary
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the number of children `n`, the number of friend pairs `m`, and the number of excursions `k`.
2. Computes the modular multiplicative inverse `c` of the total number of possible pairs `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
3. Initializes `s` (the sum of expected friendship values) and `a` (the sum of initial friendship values).
4. Iterates through the `m` friend pairs, accumulating the initial friendship values in `a`.
5. Iterates `k` times, updating `s` based on the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
6. Prints the result `s % M`.

### Issues in the Code
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. It does not properly account for the expected increase in friendship values over the `k` iterations.
   - The expected value calculation should consider the probability of selecting each pair and the cumulative increase in friendship values.

2. **Misuse of `c`**:
   - The variable `c` is the probability of selecting any specific pair in one iteration. It should be used to calculate the expected contribution of each pair over `k` iterations, but the current code does not do this correctly.

3. **Handling Friendship Values**:
   - The program correctly sums the initial friendship values `a` but does not account for the increase in these values over the `k` iterations.

### Correct Approach
To correctly calculate the expected value, we need to consider:
- The probability of selecting each pair in one iteration (`c`).
- The expected number of times each pair is selected over `k` iterations.
- The cumulative increase in friendship values for each pair.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified, the original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values over the `k` iterations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
