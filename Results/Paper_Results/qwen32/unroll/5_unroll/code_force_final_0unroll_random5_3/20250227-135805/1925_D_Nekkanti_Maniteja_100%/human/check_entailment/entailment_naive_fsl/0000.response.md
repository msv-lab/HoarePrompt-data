Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's analyze the issues in the code:

1. **Initialization and Calculation of `c`**:
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct for calculating the probability of selecting a specific pair.
   - However, the way `c` is used in the loop for `k` iterations is incorrect. The probability `c` should be used to calculate the expected contribution of each friend pair over `k` iterations, but the current code does not correctly compute this.

2. **Accumulating the Sum `s`**:
   - The loop for `k` iterations is not correctly calculating the expected sum of friendship values. The current code attempts to accumulate the sum `s` in a way that does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - Specifically, the code `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly account for the expected increase in friendship values over `k` iterations.

3. **Handling the Friendship Values**:
   - The program correctly accumulates the initial sum of friendship values `a` from the input pairs.
   - However, it does not correctly calculate the expected increase in friendship values for each pair over `k` iterations.

Here is a breakdown of a potential issue:
- Consider a simple test case with `n = 3`, `m = 1`, `k = 3`, and a single friend pair `(1, 2)` with friendship value `f = 1`.
- The expected output should be the expected sum of friendship values over 3 iterations. The probability of selecting the pair `(1, 2)` in each iteration is `1/3` (since there are 3 possible pairs: `(1,2)`, `(1,3)`, `(2,3)`).
- The expected sum of friendship values should be calculated considering the increase in friendship values over the iterations, but the current code does not do this correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Example of a failing case**:
Input:
```
1
3 1 3
1 2 1
```
Expected Output:
```
3
```
Actual Output (from the given code):
```
0
```

This shows that the code does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for friendship values over multiple iterations.
