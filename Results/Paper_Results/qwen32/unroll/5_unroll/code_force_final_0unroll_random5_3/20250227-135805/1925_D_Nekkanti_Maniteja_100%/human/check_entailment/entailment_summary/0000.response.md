### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the given problem by calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. However, the logic and implementation in the program do not correctly reflect the problem's requirements and the expected mathematical approach to solve it. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Friendship Value Calculation:**
   - The program reads the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`.
   - It then reads the pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is `n*(n-1)//2`. This is used to compute the probability of selecting any given pair of children.
   - The variable `a` is used to accumulate the sum of initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
   - The variable `s` is intended to accumulate the sum of expected friendship values over `k` excursions. However, the way `s` is updated in the loop is incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Loop for Accumulating Expected Values:**
   - The loop for `k` excursions incorrectly updates `s` as `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This formula does not correctly reflect the expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions.
   - The expected value calculation should consider the probability of selecting a pair of friends and the increase in their friendship value over the excursions. The correct approach involves calculating the expected contribution of each pair of friends to the total sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.

3. **Mathematical Approach:**
   - For each pair of friends, the expected number of times they are chosen over `k` excursions is `k / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
   - The expected sum of friendship values for a pair of friends with initial friendship value `f` over `k` excursions is `f + (f + 1) + (f + 2) + ... + (f + k - 1)`, which simplifies to `k * f + k * (k - 1) / 2`.
   - The overall expected sum of friendship values for all pairs is the sum of the expected values for each pair of friends.
   - The result should be expressed as a fraction `p/q` and the final result is `p * q^(-1) % (10^9 + 7)`.

Given the issues in the provided program, it is clear that the program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
