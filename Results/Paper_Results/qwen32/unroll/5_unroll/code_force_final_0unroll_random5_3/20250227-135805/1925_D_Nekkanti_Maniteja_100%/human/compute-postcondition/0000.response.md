In the provided task, the for loop iterates based on the integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute once for each test case. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friend pairs with their initial friendship values are part of the input for each test case, not the loop head. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.

To ensure that the loop executes, `i` should be initialized to 0, and the input function should provide an integer greater than 0, indicating the number of test cases.

State: **`i` is 0, input() must return an integer greater than 0 representing the number of test cases**
