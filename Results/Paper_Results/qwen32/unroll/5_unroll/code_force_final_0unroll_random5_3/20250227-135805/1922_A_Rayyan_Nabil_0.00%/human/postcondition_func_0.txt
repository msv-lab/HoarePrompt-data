The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. It then checks if for each position `i` in the strings, at least one of `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches `c[i]`. If this condition holds for all positions in the last test case, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
