To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the code step-by-step:

The initial state provides:
- `t`: Number of test cases (1 <= `t` <= 1000)
- `n`: Length of the strings `a`, `b`, `c` (1 <= `n` <= 20)
- `a`, `b`, `c`: Strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters
- `l`: Initially set to `'YES'`

The loop runs `t` times, and for each iteration:
1. `n` is read as an integer.
2. `a`, `b`, `c` are read as strings.
3. A nested loop runs `n` times where it checks if for each index `i`, `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`.
4. If the condition in step 3 is never satisfied for any `i` in the range `n`, `l` is set to `'NO'` and printed.
5. If the condition in step 3 is satisfied for at least one `i` in the range `n`, `l` remains `'YES'` and is printed.

However, there is a logical mistake in the provided code. The variable `l` is initially set to `'YES'` before the loop starts, but it is reassigned inside the loop without considering the previous value. This means that if the condition is satisfied at any point during the inner loop, `l` will be `'YES'`, and if it is not satisfied for any `i`, `l` will be `'NO'` only for that specific iteration. The value of `l` from previous iterations does not affect the current one.

To summarize, for each test case, the output will be `'YES'` if there exists at least one index `i` where `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. Otherwise, it will be `'NO'`.

Since the question asks for the output state after all iterations, and the output for each iteration is printed immediately, the final output state will depend on the last iteration's result. But since the question asks for a general output state format, we'll consider the last iteration's potential outcomes.

Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

Given the logic, the output state after all iterations will be determined by the last test case's result. However, without knowing the specific inputs, we cannot definitively state the exact output of the last test case. For the sake of providing a structured answer, we'll describe the state in terms of the last test case's result.

Output State: **l is 'YES' or 'NO' based on the last test case's strings a, b, and c.**
