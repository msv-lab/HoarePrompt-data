t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. coordinates is a list of lists, where each inner list contains 8 integers representing the coordinates of the corners of t squares. Each coordinate (x_i, y_i) satisfies -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. It is guaranteed that for each square, there are exactly four distinct points that form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
