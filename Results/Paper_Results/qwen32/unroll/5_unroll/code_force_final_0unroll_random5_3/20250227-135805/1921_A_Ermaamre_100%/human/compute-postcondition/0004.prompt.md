You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each of the following t test cases consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive (strictly greater than 0) area.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        
        print(dx * dx)
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, and for each test case, the program outputs the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum of the first elements of four input lists.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of four integers `x_i` and `y_i` representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The function returns the area of each square for the given test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
