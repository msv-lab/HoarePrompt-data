In the provided for loop, the only variables in the loop head are the underscore `_` and the variable `t`. The underscore `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not plan to use, and `t` is the number of iterations the loop will execute, which is determined by the value of `t`.

Given that `t` is the integer read from the input and it satisfies `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, the loop will execute `t` times. The state of `t` before the loop starts is already defined as an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. Therefore, no adjustment to `t` is necessary to ensure the loop executes.

Since the underscore `_` is not a variable we need to adjust (it is just a placeholder), the only state we need to consider is `t`.

State: **`t` is the integer read from the input, representing the number of test cases, and it satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 100**
