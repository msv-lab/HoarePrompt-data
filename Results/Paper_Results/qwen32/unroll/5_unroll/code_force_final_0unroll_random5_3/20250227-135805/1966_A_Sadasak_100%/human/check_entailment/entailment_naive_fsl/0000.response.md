Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the allowed operations. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Frequency Table Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the frequency of each card number but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This means that if there are more than `k` cards of the same number, it will only consider `k` of them, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach should be to count the actual frequency of each card number.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cards:**
   - The program checks if `k` is in the frequency table values and prints `k - 1` if true. This is not the correct way to determine the minimum number of cards. Instead, the program should calculate the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the allowed operations.

3. **General Approach:**
   - The correct approach is to use the frequency of each card number and apply the operation of exchanging `k` cards for `k-1` cards as many times as possible. This can be done by iterating over the frequency of each card number and reducing the count by `k-1` until the count is less than `k`.

Let's consider a simple test case to illustrate the issue:
```
Input:
1
6 3
1 1 1 1 1 1

Expected Output:
2

Explanation:
We can exchange 3 cards of number 1 for 2 cards, resulting in 5 cards of number 1.
We can then exchange another 3 cards of number 1 for 2 cards, resulting in 4 cards of number 1.
We can then exchange another 3 cards of number 1 for 2 cards, resulting in 3 cards of number 1.
Finally, we can exchange 3 cards of number 1 for 2 cards, resulting in 2 cards of number 1.
```

The provided program will not produce the correct result for this test case or for many other test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
