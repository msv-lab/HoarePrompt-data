Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr), and the length of arr, denoted as n, satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, there can be up to 10^4 test cases, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `i` is 0.**

Natural Language: The variable `i` has been assigned the value 0. The initial state of `arr` and the conditions on its elements and length remain unchanged.
