The variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of the list `arr`. The state of `arr` remains unchanged, and `i` is still 0. The length of `arr`, denoted as `n`, satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr), `n` is the length of `arr`, and `i` is 0.**
