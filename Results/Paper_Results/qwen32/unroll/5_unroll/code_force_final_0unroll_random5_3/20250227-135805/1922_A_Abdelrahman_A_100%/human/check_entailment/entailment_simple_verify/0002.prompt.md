You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()

        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem according to the given description.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
- Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

### Template Matching Rules:
- If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then the corresponding letter in `a` and `b` must be the same as the template.
- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then the corresponding letter in `a` and `b` must be different from the lowercase version of the template.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program checks if `c` is exactly the same as `a` or `b`. If so, it immediately prints "NO" and moves to the next test case. This check is correct because if `c` is the same as either `a` or `b`, there is no way to construct a template that would match `a` and `b` but not `c`.

3. **Template Construction:**
   - If `c` is not the same as `a` or `b`, the program attempts to construct a template `t` by iterating over each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if the character `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If such a position is found, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop. This is because, at that position, we can use `c[i].upper()` in the template, which would match `a[i]` and `b[i]` (since they are different from `c[i]`), but not `c[i]`.

4. **Final Check:**
   - If the loop completes without finding a position where `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, the program prints "NO". This is correct because, in this case, there is no way to construct a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly handle all cases where a valid template can be constructed. Specifically, it only checks if `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This is not sufficient to construct a valid template.
- To correctly construct a template, we need to ensure that for each position `i`, the template character can be chosen such that:
  - If `a[i] == b[i]`, then the template character must be different from `a[i]` (uppercase).
  - If `a[i] != b[i]`, then the template character can be either `a[i].upper()` or `b[i].upper()`, as long as `c[i]` does not match the lowercase version of the template character.

### Example Issue:
For the test case:
```
3
acc
abd
abc
```
The program will print "NO" because at position 0, `c[0]` is not different from both `a[0]` and `b[0]`. However, a valid template could be "A" (uppercase A), which matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle all cases where a valid template can be constructed.

Correctness: **False**
