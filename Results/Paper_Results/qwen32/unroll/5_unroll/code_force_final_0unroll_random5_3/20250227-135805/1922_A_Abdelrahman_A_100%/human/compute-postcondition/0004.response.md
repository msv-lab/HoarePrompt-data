Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of equal length. For each test case, it determines if string `c` can be formed by selecting characters from the corresponding positions in strings `a` and `b`. It prints 'YES' if `c` can be formed in this manner, otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
