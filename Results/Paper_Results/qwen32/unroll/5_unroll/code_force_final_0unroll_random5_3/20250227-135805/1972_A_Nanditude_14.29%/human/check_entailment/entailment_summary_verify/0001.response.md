### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary provided to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The goal is to ensure that each problem in list `a` has a difficulty that is less than or equal to the corresponding problem in list `b`. If a problem in `a` is more difficult than expected, a new problem with difficulty `w` (where `w` is the expected difficulty from `b`) can be inserted into `a`, and the list `a` must be sorted in non-decreasing order after each insertion. The most difficult problem (the last element in the sorted list) must then be removed.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse through lists `a` and `b`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to count the number of new problems added.
   - Two pointers `i` and `j` are initialized to 0 to traverse lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Traversal and Comparison**:
   - The program uses a `while` loop to traverse both lists until one of the pointers reaches the end of its respective list.
   - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current problem in `a` is too difficult compared to the expected difficulty in `b`. The program then:
     - Removes the last element of `a`.
     - Inserts `b[j]` at the position `i` in `a`.
     - Increments the counter `cnt`.
     - Moves pointer `j` to the next problem in `b`.
   - If `b[j] >= a[i]`, it means the current problem in `a` meets the expected difficulty, so it moves both pointers `i` and `j` to the next problems.

3. **Sorting Issue**:
   - The main issue with the program is that after inserting `b[j]` at position `i` and removing the last element, the list `a` is not guaranteed to be sorted. The problem requires that after inserting a new problem, the list `a` should be sorted in non-decreasing order, and the most difficult problem should be removed.

#### Function Summary:
- The function summary provided (`func_1(arr)`) does not seem to be used in the provided code and is unrelated to the logic of the program. It suggests sorting a list in descending order, which is not the required operation for this problem.

#### Correct Approach:
The correct approach would involve:
- For each problem in `b` that is less than the corresponding problem in `a`, insert a new problem with difficulty `b[j]` into `a`.
- Sort the list `a` after each insertion.
- Remove the last element from `a` after sorting.
- Count the number of insertions made.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. The main issue is that the program does not sort the list `a` after inserting a new problem and removing the last element. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
