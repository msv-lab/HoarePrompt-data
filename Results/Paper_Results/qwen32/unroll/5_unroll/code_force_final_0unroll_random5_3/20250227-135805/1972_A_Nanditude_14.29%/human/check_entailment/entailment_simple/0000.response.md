Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to solve the problem by iterating through the lists `a` and `b` and ensuring that after inserting new problems, the difficulty of each problem in `a` does not exceed the corresponding difficulty in `b`. However, the logic used in the program is flawed. The function `func_1` is defined but never used in the program, and the main logic inside the while loop does not correctly simulate the process of adding new problems and removing the most difficult one.

The main issue with the program is in the following part:
```python
if b[j] < a[i]:
    a.pop(-1)
    a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]
    cnt += 1
    j += 1
else:
    i += 1
    j += 1
```
This part of the code attempts to insert `b[j]` into `a` at position `i` if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`. However, this does not correctly simulate the process of inserting a new problem and removing the most difficult one. Instead, it should attempt to insert a new problem with difficulty `b[j]` (or any valid difficulty that is less than or equal to `b[j]`), sort the list `a`, and then remove the last element.

Since the provided program does not correctly implement the described logic, it will not produce the correct output for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
