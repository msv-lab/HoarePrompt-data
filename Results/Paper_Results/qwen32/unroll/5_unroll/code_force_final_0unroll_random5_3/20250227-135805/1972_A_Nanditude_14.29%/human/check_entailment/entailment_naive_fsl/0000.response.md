Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, there are a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Insertion and Sorting Logic**:
   - The code attempts to insert `b[j]` into `a` at position `i` and then sort `a` again, which is not the correct approach. The problem statement specifies that a new problem with difficulty `w` should be inserted into `a`, and then the array should be sorted in non-decreasing order, and the last element should be removed. The code does not actually insert `b[j]` as a new problem but instead tries to place it at a specific position and sort again, which is not the intended behavior.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Insertion**:
   - The condition `if b[j] < a[i]` is not appropriate for determining when to insert a new problem. The logic should ensure that `a[i]` is always less than or equal to `b[i]` after potentially inserting new problems and removing the most difficult one.

3. **Incorrect Handling of `cnt`**:
   - The counter `cnt` is incremented whenever `b[j] < a[i]`, but this does not accurately reflect the number of new problems needed. The counter should only be incremented when a new problem is actually inserted.

4. **Unused Function**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but never used in the code. This function sorts the array in reverse order, which is not needed based on the problem description.

Here is a corrected version of the code that follows the problem description:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if a[i] > b[i]:
            # Insert a new problem with difficulty less than or equal to b[i]
            a.insert(i, b[i])
            # Remove the most difficult problem
            a.pop()
            cnt += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(cnt)
```

This corrected version ensures that new problems are inserted as needed and the most difficult problem is removed, maintaining the non-decreasing order of `a` after each operation.
