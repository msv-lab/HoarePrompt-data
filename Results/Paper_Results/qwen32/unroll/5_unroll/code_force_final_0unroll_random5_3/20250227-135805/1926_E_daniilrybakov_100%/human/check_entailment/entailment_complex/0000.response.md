### Reasoning:
The task is to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav according to a specific process involving odd numbers and their multiples. The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the k-th card for each test case.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, it reads `n` (the total number of cards) and `k` (the position of the card to be found).
3. **Calculation of k-th Card**:
   - It initializes `s` (a counter for the number of cards processed so far) to 0 and `m` (a multiplier) to 1.
   - It enters a while loop that continues until all cards are processed (`n` becomes 0).
   - In each iteration of the while loop, it calculates `x`, which is the number of odd-numbered cards in the current segment (`(n + 1) // 2`).
   - It then divides `n` by 2 to move to the next segment of cards (multiples of the next integer).
   - If the current segment contains the k-th card (`s < k <= s + x`), it breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it adds `x` to `s` and multiplies `m` by 2 to move to the next segment.
4. **Output**: After breaking out of the loop, it calculates the k-th card using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m` and prints it.

This logic correctly identifies the k-th card by iteratively narrowing down the segments of cards (odd numbers, multiples of 2, multiples of 4, etc.) until the segment containing the k-th card is found. The formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m` correctly computes the position of the k-th card within the identified segment.
