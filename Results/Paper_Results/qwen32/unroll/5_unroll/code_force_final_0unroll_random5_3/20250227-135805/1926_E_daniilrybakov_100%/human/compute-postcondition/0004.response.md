Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` (where `1 ≤ k ≤ n`). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without altering any global state or input values.**
