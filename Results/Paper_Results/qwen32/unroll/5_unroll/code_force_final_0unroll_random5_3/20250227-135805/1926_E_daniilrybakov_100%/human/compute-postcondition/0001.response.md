In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer input provided, and it satisfies the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\). The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the range `t`. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute.

Since the loop will execute `t` times, and `t` is already given to be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need any specific state adjustment.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is at least 1. Given that the problem states `t` satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), no further adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is the integer input provided, and it satisfies 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4**
