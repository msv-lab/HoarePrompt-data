The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Given the initial state, `t` was already defined as an integer within the range 1 to 5 · 10^4. After executing the code, `t` will hold the value of the integer input provided. The ranges for `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided, and it satisfies 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9.**
