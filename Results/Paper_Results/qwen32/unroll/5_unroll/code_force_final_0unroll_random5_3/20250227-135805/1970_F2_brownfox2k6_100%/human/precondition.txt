N and M are integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99 and both N and M are odd. The field is a 2D grid of N rows and M columns where each cell contains either ".." (empty), "R0", ..., "R9" (red players), "B0", ..., "B9" (blue players), "RG" (red goal), "BG" (blue goal), ".Q" (Quaffle), or ".B" (Bludger). T is an integer such that 0 <= T <= 10000, and the following T lines describe the actions performed by the entities in the field. Each action line contains a pair of characters representing the entity and a valid action (U, D, L, R for movement, C to catch a ball, T to throw the Quaffle).
