### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its functions to determine if they correctly implement the problem description.

1. **Initialization:**
   - The field dimensions `N` and `M` are read.
   - The field is parsed to identify positions of red goals (`RG`), blue goals (`BG`), the Quaffle (`.Q`), the Bludger (`.B`), and players (`R0`, `R1`, ..., `B0`, `B1`, ...).
   - Initial positions of these entities are stored in appropriate data structures (`rg`, `bg`, `blud`, `player`).
   - The number of steps `T` is read, and the initial score for both teams is set to 0.

2. **Processing Each Step:**
   - For each step, the entity and action are read.
   - Depending on the action, the program performs different operations:
     - **C (Catch):** The player starts carrying the Quaffle.
     - **T (Throw):** The player releases the Quaffle, and the score is updated if the Quaffle is in a goal. The Quaffle is then moved to the center of the field.
     - **Movement (U, D, L, R):** The entity moves in the specified direction.
   - If the entity is the Quaffle or the Bludger, `func_1` is called to update its position.
   - If the entity is a player, `func_1` is called to update its position, and `func_2` is called to check if the player has been eliminated by the Bludger.
   - If the player is carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle's position is updated to match the player's position.

3. **Functions:**
   - **`func_1`:** This function updates the position of an entity based on the direction of movement. It correctly modifies the coordinates of the entity.
   - **`func_2`:** This function checks if any player is in the same position as the Bludger. If so, it eliminates the player by setting their position to `[-1, -1]` and prints the elimination message.

4. **Scoring:**
   - If the Quaffle is thrown into a goal, the score is updated, and a message is printed indicating which team scored.
   - If the Quaffle is thrown into the wrong goal, the score is updated for the opposing team.

5. **Final Output:**
   - After processing all steps, the final score is printed.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements all the rules and requirements of the problem description. It accurately updates positions, handles scoring, and manages eliminations. Therefore, the code is correct.

**Correctness: True**
