Postcondition: **`obj` is a list containing two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field. If `d` is 'L', the second integer in `obj` is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'R', the second integer in `obj` is incremented by 1. If `d` is neither 'L' nor 'R', the list `obj` remains unchanged. The direction `d` can be 'L' or 'R'.**
