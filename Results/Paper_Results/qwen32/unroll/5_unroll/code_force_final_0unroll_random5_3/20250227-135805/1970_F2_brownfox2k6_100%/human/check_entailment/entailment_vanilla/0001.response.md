Let's analyze the provided Python code snippet and compare it to the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Code Analysis

The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Let's break down each function:

#### Function 1: `func_1(obj, d)`
- **Purpose**: This function is intended to update the position of an object (`obj`) based on the direction (`d`) provided.
- **Parameters**:
  - `obj`: A list representing the coordinates of an object, e.g., `[x, y]`.
  - `d`: A string representing the direction of movement: 'U' (up), 'D' (down), 'L' (left), or 'R' (right).
- **Implementation**:
  - If `d` is 'U', it decreases the y-coordinate by 1.
  - If `d` is 'D', it increases the y-coordinate by 1.
  - If `d` is 'L', it decreases the x-coordinate by 1.
  - If `d` is 'R', it increases the x-coordinate by 1.
- **Correctness**: This function correctly updates the position of an object based on the direction provided. It appears to be a valid implementation for moving an object on a grid.

#### Function 2: `func_2(t)`
- **Purpose**: This function is intended to check if any player is in the same position as the Bludger and, if so, eliminate the player.
- **Parameters**:
  - `t`: An integer representing the current time step.
- **Implementation**:
  - It iterates over the `player` dictionary to find players whose position matches the position of the Bludger (`blud`).
  - For each player found in the same position as the Bludger, it appends the player's identifier to the `out` list and sets the player's position to `[-1, -1]` (indicating elimination).
  - It then prints the elimination event for each player in alphabetical order.
- **Correctness**: This function correctly identifies players in the same position as the Bludger and prints the elimination event. However, there are some issues:
  - The `player` dictionary and `blud` variable are not defined within the function or passed as parameters, which would result in a `NameError`.
  - The function assumes that the `player` dictionary contains player identifiers as keys and their positions as values, and that `blud` is a list representing the Bludger's position. This assumption is not validated or explained in the code snippet.

### Additional Issues
- The code snippet does not handle the main logic of the game, such as scoring goals, catching and throwing the Quaffle, or updating the field state.
- The code does not include any logic for parsing the input, processing the actions, or printing the final score.
- The code does not handle the movement of the Bludger or other entities, which is crucial for the game's rules.

### Conclusion
The provided code snippet is incomplete and contains undefined variables (`player` and `blud`). While `func_1` correctly implements the movement logic, `func_2` is incomplete and relies on external variables that are not defined. Therefore, the code snippet is not a complete or correct solution to the problem.

**Correctness: False**
