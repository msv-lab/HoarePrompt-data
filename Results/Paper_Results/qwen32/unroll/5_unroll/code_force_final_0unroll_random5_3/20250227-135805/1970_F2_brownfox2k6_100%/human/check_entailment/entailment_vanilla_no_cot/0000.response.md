Correctness: **False**

The provided code snippets are incomplete and do not fully implement the solution to the problem described. Here are some issues with the provided code:

1. **Incomplete Functions**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are defined but not used in the context of the full program. They seem to be responsible for moving objects and handling eliminations, respectively, but they are not integrated into a larger function or main loop that processes the game steps.

2. **Global Variables**: The functions reference global variables such as `player` and `blud` which are not defined in the provided code. These variables would need to be initialized and managed throughout the game.

3. **Handling Actions**: The code does not include any mechanism to parse the input actions and apply them to the game state. This would involve reading the actions, determining which function to call, and updating the game state accordingly.

4. **Event Logging**: The code does not include any logic for logging the events as specified in the problem description, such as when a goal is scored or a player is eliminated.

5. **Final Score**: The code does not include any logic to calculate and print the final score of the game.

6. **Main Loop**: There is no main loop that iterates over the game steps and applies the actions to the game state.

To make the code correct, a complete implementation would need to be provided that includes all these components.
