### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the provided program is incorrect because it does not compute the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using the specified cyclic shift operation. Let's re-evaluate the function and its logic in the context of the problem description.

The function `func_1` calculates the cost based on the number of consecutive '1's encountered before a '0' appears. Specifically, for each '0' encountered after one or more '1's, it adds the count of these '1's plus one to the total cost. This logic seems to be derived from the idea that each '0' that follows a sequence of '1's will require a cyclic shift to bring the '1's before it, and the cost of this shift is the length of the substring involved.

However, let's consider the example provided in the original assessment: `110100`.

- The first two characters are '1's, so `one` becomes 2.
- The third character is '0', so the cost is incremented by `one + 1 = 3`. Now, `cost` is 3.
- The fourth character is '1', so `one` becomes 3.
- The fifth character is '0', so the cost is incremented by `one + 1 = 4`. Now, `cost` is 7.
- The sixth character is '0', so the cost remains 7 as there are no more '1's.

The original assessment suggests the optimal cost for `110100` is 8, which involves two shifts of substrings `[1, 4]` and `[2, 5]`. However, the function `func_1` calculates the cost as 7, which seems to be incorrect based on this specific example.

Let's consider another example to see if the function logic holds:

- For the string `101011`, the cost calculation by the function would be:
  - First character is '1', so `one` becomes 1.
  - Second character is '0', so the cost is incremented by `one + 1 = 2`. Now, `cost` is 2.
  - Third character is '1', so `one` becomes 1.
  - Fourth character is '0', so the cost is incremented by `one + 1 = 2`. Now, `cost` is 4.
  - Fifth character is '1', so `one` becomes 1.
  - Sixth character is '1', so `one` becomes 2.
  - The final cost is 4 (no more '0's after this point).

The output for `101011` is 5, which matches the given example.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1` does not consistently compute the minimum cost for all binary strings. The logic behind the function does not account for all possible optimal cyclic shifts required to sort the string. The original assessment is correct in identifying that the function does not always provide the minimum cost.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
