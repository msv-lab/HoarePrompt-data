Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the cost based on segments of consecutive '1's in the binary string. However, the logic used in the function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.

Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the cost as the sum of (number of consecutive '1's + 1) for each segment of consecutive '1's in the string. This approach does not account for the minimum operations required to cyclically shift substrings to achieve a sorted order.

2. **Ignoring the Optimal Substring Choice**: The problem requires choosing any substring and cyclically shifting it to minimize the total cost. The provided function does not consider different substrings and their effects on the overall cost. It only considers segments of consecutive '1's, which is not a comprehensive approach to solving the problem.

3. **Example Analysis**: Let's take the third test case from the example: `11000`. According to the function, the cost would be calculated as follows:
   - There are two '1's in a row, so the cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - However, the correct minimum cost to sort this string is `9`, as shown in the example, which involves multiple cyclic shifts of different substrings.

4. **General Case**: The correct approach involves dynamic programming or a more sophisticated algorithm to determine the optimal sequence of cyclic shifts that minimizes the total cost. The provided function does not implement such an approach.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
