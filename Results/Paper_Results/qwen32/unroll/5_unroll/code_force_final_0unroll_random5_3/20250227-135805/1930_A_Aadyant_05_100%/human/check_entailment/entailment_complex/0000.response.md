### Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by following these steps:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It initializes a score `s` to 0.
   - It reads the integers for the current test case, converts them to a list of integers, and sorts them.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list, taking the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) and adds them to the score `s`.
3. **Output**: After processing all test cases, it prints the score for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Sorting**: By sorting the list of integers, the smallest elements are placed at the beginning. Taking the elements at even indices ensures that we are always adding the smaller of each pair to the score, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
- **Correctness of Logic**: The logic of taking the minimum of each pair by sorting and summing the even-indexed elements is correct based on the problem description.
- **Code Execution**: The code correctly processes each test case and outputs the expected results as described in the problem statement and examples.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy to achieve the maximum final score by sorting the numbers and summing the elements at even indices for each test case.

### Correctness: **True**
