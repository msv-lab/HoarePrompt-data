The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), representing that there are 2n integers on the whiteboard. The next line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), which are the numbers written on the whiteboard. The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), the number of test cases.
