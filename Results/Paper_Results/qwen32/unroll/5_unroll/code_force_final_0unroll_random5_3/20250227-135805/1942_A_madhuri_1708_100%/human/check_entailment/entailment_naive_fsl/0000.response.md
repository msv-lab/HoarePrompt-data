Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all cases correctly as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the cases:

1. **Case 1: When k == n**
   - The code correctly handles this case by printing an array of length `n` with all elements equal to `k`. For example, for `n = 2` and `k = 2`, it outputs `2 2`, which is correct.

2. **Case 2: When k < n**
   - The code handles this case by printing an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This is correct for `k = 1` because only the first cyclic shift is sorted. However, it does not handle cases where `1 < k < n`.
   
3. **Case 3: When k > 2 and k < n**
   - The code incorrectly outputs `-1` for these cases. However, there are valid arrays for these cases. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 1]`. The cyclic shifts are `[1, 2, 1]` (sorted), `[2, 1, 1]` (sorted), and `[1, 1, 2]` (not sorted), which satisfies the condition of having exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts.

4. **Case 4: When k = 1**
   - The code correctly handles this case by printing an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 1`, it outputs `1 2 3`, which is correct because only the first cyclic shift is sorted.

To summarize, the code fails to correctly handle cases where `1 < k < n`. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:
- **Input:** `3 2`
- **Expected Output:** `1 2 1` (or any other array that has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts)
- **Actual Output:** `-1`

Thus, the program is incorrect.
