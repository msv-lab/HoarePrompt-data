To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand how the loop processes each line of input and what it prints based on the conditions provided.

The loop reads each line of input (except the first line which is the number of test cases `t`), splits it into two integers `n` and `k`, and then performs the following checks and operations:

1. If `k >= 2`:
   - If `n == k`, it prints a list of `k` elements, each being `k`.
   - If `n != k`, it prints `-1`.

2. If `k < 2` (i.e., `k == 1`):
   - It prints a list of numbers from `1` to `n`.

Given the conditions and the operations, the output state will be a series of printed lines corresponding to the results of each test case.

Let's break this down further:

- For each test case where `k >= 2`:
  - If `n == k`, the output will be a sequence of `k` numbers, all equal to `k`.
  - If `n != k`, the output will be `-1`.

- For each test case where `k < 2` (i.e., `k == 1`):
  - The output will be a sequence of numbers from `1` to `n`.

Since the output is determined by the conditions and is printed line by line, the final "state" in terms of variables doesn't change. The loop itself modifies no variables outside its scope, and the only effect is the printed output.

Therefore, the output state can be described as the series of printed lines for each test case based on the conditions above.

Output State: **A series of printed lines for each test case based on the conditions: if k >= 2 and n == k, prints k repeated k times; if k >= 2 and n != k, prints -1; if k < 2, prints numbers from 1 to n.**
