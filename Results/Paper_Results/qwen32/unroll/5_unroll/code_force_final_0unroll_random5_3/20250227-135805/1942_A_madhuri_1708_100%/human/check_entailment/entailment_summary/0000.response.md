### Reasoning:

The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by handling different cases based on the values of `n` and `k`. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **When `k >= 2`:**
   - If `k == n`, the program outputs an array where each element is `k`. This means that the array is `[k, k, ..., k]` (n times). In this case, all cyclic shifts of the array will be the same and will be sorted, which satisfies the requirement that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - If `k != n`, the program outputs `-1`. This is because it's impossible to have exactly `k` cyclic shifts sorted when `k` is not equal to `n` and `k >= 2`. If `k` cyclic shifts are sorted, and `k < n`, then there would be at least one sorted shift that repeats among the cyclic shifts, implying more than `k` sorted shifts in total.

2. **When `k < 2`:**
   - The only value for `k` that fits this condition is `k = 1` (since `k` is a positive integer). The program outputs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This array is sorted, and it is the only sorted cyclic shift among all possible cyclic shifts, which satisfies the requirement that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.

### Analysis of the Execution Summary:
- The execution summary correctly identifies the conditions under which the program outputs an array or `-1`.
- The program correctly handles the case when `k >= 2` and `n == k` by outputting an array of `k` repeated `k` times.
- The program correctly handles the case when `k >= 2` and `n != k` by outputting `-1`.
- The program correctly handles the case when `k < 2` (specifically `k = 1`) by outputting the array `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
