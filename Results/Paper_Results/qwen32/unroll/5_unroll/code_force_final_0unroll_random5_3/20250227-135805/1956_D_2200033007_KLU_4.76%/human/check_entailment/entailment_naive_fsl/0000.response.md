Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. The program only handles two specific cases (when the length of the array is 2 and when it is not 2) and does not provide a general solution for any array length or values. 

Let's consider some cases where the program will fail:

1. **Case with n = 2 and values other than 0 and 1:**
   - Input:
     ```
     2
     2 3
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     4 1
     1 2
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     4 1
     1 2
     ```
     (This is correct for the given example in the problem description, but the program does not handle other values correctly for n = 2)

2. **Case with n > 2 and values other than 1, 3, 9:**
   - Input:
     ```
     4
     1 2 3 4
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     10 3
     1 1
     2 2
     1 4
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     13 0
     ```
     (This is incorrect as the sum can be increased by performing operations)

3. **Case with n = 1 and value other than 0:**
   - Input:
     ```
     1
     5
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     1 1
     1 1
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     1 1
     1 1
     ```
     (This is correct for the given example in the problem description, but the program does not handle other values correctly for n = 1)

The program does not implement any logic to compute the MEX and perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array. It only provides hardcoded outputs for specific cases, which is not a general solution. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
