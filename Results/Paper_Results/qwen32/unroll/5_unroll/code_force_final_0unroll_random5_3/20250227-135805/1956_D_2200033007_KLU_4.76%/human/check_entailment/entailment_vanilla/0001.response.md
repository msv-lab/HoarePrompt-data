Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. It has several issues:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input array `a` as strings, not integers. This will cause issues when performing arithmetic operations or comparisons on the array elements.
2. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` only handles the cases where the length of the array is 2 or not 2. It does not implement the logic to compute the MEX and perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array.
3. **Output**: The program always outputs the same results for arrays of length 2 and arrays of any other length, which is incorrect and does not follow the problem's requirements.
4. **General Logic**: The program lacks the logic to find the MEX of any subarray and to perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
