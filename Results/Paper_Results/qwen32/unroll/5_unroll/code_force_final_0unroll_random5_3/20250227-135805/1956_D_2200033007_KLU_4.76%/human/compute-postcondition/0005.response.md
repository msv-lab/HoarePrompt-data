The given print statement is:

```python
print(f'13 0')
```

This print statement uses an f-string to format the output. However, the f-string in this case does not actually use any variables from the initial state; it simply prints the string `'13 0'` as it is.

There are no variables `c` or `m` used in the print statement, and the initial state does not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Thus, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **13 0**
