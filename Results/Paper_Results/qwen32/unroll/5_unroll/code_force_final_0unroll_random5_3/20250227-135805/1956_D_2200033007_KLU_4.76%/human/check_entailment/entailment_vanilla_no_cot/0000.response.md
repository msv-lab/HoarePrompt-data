Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. It only handles two specific cases (when the length of the array is 2 or not 2) and outputs hardcoded results that do not correspond to the correct maximum sum for arbitrary arrays. The program does not implement the logic to compute the MEX and update the array to maximize the sum of its elements. It also does not generate the correct sequence of operations to achieve this maximum sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the general problem as described.
