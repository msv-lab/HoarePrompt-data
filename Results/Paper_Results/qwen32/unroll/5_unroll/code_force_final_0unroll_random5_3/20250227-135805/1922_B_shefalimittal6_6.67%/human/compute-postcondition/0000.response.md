Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The other conditions and variables (`n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) remain unchanged as they have not been affected by the provided code snippet.
