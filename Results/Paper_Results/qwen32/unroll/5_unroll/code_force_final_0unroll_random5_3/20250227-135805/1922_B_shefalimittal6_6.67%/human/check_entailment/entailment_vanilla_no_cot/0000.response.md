Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The key issue lies in the application of the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. The program does not properly apply this theorem.

Here are some specific points where the program falls short:

1. **Triangle Inequality Theorem**: The program does not check if the three chosen sticks satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. It simply counts combinations of sticks without verifying if they can form a triangle.
   
2. **Counting Combinations**: The program attempts to count valid combinations but does so in a manner that does not account for the triangle inequality. For example, it counts combinations where two sticks of the same length are paired with another stick without checking if the sum of the two smaller sticks is greater than the third stick.

3. **Handling Overlaps**: The program does not handle overlaps correctly when counting combinations. For example, if there are multiple sticks of the same length, it may double-count or incorrectly count combinations.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate through all possible combinations of three sticks and check if they satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. Given the constraints, an efficient approach would be to sort the sticks and use a two-pointer technique to count valid combinations.

Here is a corrected version of the program that properly applies the triangle inequality theorem:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums = sorted([2 ** a for a in nums])
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            j = i + 1
            k = j + 1
            while j < n:
                while k < n and nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k]:
                    k += 1
                res += k - j - 1
                j += 1
        print(res)

func()
```

This corrected version sorts the sticks and uses a two-pointer technique to efficiently count the number of valid combinations that satisfy the triangle inequality theorem.
