Reasoning:
The provided program aims to maximize the total difference \( D \) between two arrays, \( a \) and \( c \), where \( c \) is formed by selecting and arranging \( n \) integers from a given list of \( m \) integers. The strategy used in the program is to sort array \( a \) in ascending order and array \( c \) in descending order. Then, it iteratively pairs the smallest element of \( a \) with the largest available element of \( c \) and vice versa, always choosing the pair that gives a larger difference.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. **Edge Case Handling**: If both arrays \( a \) and \( c \) contain the same single element, the maximum difference \( D \) is 0.
2. **Sorting**: The program sorts array \( a \) in ascending order and array \( c \) in descending order.
3. **Maximizing Differences**: It then iterates through the elements of \( a \) and \( c \), pairing the smallest element of \( a \) with the largest element of \( c \) and vice versa, always choosing the pair that gives a larger difference.
4. **Single Element Array**: If \( a \) contains only one element, the program calculates the maximum difference by comparing that element with the maximum and minimum elements of \( c \).

The provided execution summary indicates that the function processes multiple test cases and calculates the required difference for each. Since the logic aligns with the problem statement and the approach is sound, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
