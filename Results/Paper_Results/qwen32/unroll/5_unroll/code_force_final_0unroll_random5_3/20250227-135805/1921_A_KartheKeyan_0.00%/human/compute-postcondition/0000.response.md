The given Python code snippet processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `l`. For each test case, it calculates a value `s` based on the integer `l` and prints `s`. The variable `n` keeps track of the number of test cases and is decremented after each test case is processed.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- For each test case, there are four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

However, the code provided does not utilize the coordinates (x_i, y_i) of the square corners. Instead, it focuses on the integer `l` for each test case.

Let's analyze the code:
- `n = int(input())`: This line reads the number of test cases, `n`.
- The `while n` loop runs `n` times.
- Inside the loop:
  - `l = int(input())`: Reads an integer `l` for the current test case.
  - `s = 0`: Initializes `s` to 0.
  - `s += (l//4) + (l - (4*(l//4)))//2`: Updates `s` with a specific calculation.
  - `print(s)`: Prints the value of `s`.
  - `n -= 1`: Decrements `n` by 1 to move to the next test case.

The value of `s` for each test case is calculated based on the formula `(l//4) + (l - (4*(l//4)))//2`.

Since the code processes multiple test cases and the value of `s` is dependent on the input `l` for each test case, the final state will reflect the number of test cases processed (`n` will be 0), and the specific values of `s` will be printed for each test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is 0; the value of `s` is printed for each of the original `n` test cases.**
