### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated code.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. Passwords should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the length of the password (`n`) and the password itself.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1` that takes `n` and the password as input.
   - Inside the function, it separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It iterates through the password to check if any letter is immediately followed by a digit. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.
   - If none of the above conditions are violated, it returns 'YES'.

#### Verification Against Test Cases:

Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `4`, `12ac`
   - Letters: `['a', 'c']`, Digits: `['1', '2']`
   - Both lists are sorted, and no digit follows a letter.
   - **Output:** `YES` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `5`, `123wa`
   - Letters: `['a', 'w']`, Digits: `['1', '2', '3']`
   - Letters are not in non-decreasing order.
   - **Output:** `NO` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `9`, `allllmost`
   - Letters: `['a', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'm', 'o', 's', 't']`, Digits: `[]`
   - Letters are in non-decreasing order.
   - **Output:** `YES` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `5`, `ac123`
   - Letters: `['a', 'c']`, Digits: `['1', '2', '3']`
   - A digit follows a letter.
   - **Output:** `NO` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `6`, `011679`
   - Letters: `[]`, Digits: `['0', '1', '1', '6', '7', '9']`
   - Digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - **Output:** `YES` (Correct)

#### Annotations Validation:
The annotations provided describe the state of the program correctly at key points:
- After separating characters into `letters` and `digits`, the state is accurately described.
- The checks for sorted order and the presence of a digit after a letter are correctly annotated.
- The final return value is correctly annotated based on the conditions checked.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions required for a password to be considered strong. It accurately identifies whether a password is strong or not based on the given criteria.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: True**
