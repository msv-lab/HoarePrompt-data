Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Password must consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- No digit should come after a letter.
- All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
- All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Code:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` checks if the lowercase letters and digits in the password are sorted individually.
- It returns 'NO' if any lowercase letter is immediately followed by a digit.
- Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness:** **False**
- **Explanation:** The program does not handle cases where a digit appears after any letter. It only checks if the first letter is followed by a digit.

### Analysis:
1. **Sorting Check:**
   - The function correctly checks if the letters and digits are sorted individually using `sorted()`.
   
2. **Digit After Letter Check:**
   - The function uses a loop to check each character and its next character. If a letter is followed by a digit, it returns 'NO'.
   - However, this check only ensures that no letter is directly followed by a digit. It does not ensure that no digit appears after any letter in the password.

### Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
- **Input:** `5`, `abc12`
- **Expected Output:** `NO`
- **Actual Output:** `YES`

The function `func_1` will iterate through the password "abc12" and find that 'c' (a letter) is followed by '1' (a digit). This should correctly trigger a 'NO' response.

However, the original assessment suggests that the function should also handle cases where a digit appears after any letter, not just directly after. Let's verify this with another test case:
- **Input:** `5`, `a1b2c`
- **Expected Output:** `NO`
- **Actual Output:** `YES`

In this case, the function will not return 'NO' because it only checks consecutive characters, not the overall order of letters and digits.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle cases where a digit appears after any letter, not just directly after. The function should be modified to ensure that once a digit is encountered, no letters should follow it.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
