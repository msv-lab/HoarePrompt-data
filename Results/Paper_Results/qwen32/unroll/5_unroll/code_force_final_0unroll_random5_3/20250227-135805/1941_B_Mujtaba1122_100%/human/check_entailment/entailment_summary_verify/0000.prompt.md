You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` as input, where `n` is the length of the list and is between 3 and 2 * 10^5. It modifies the list by potentially reducing the values of elements from index 1 to `n-2` based on the values of their neighboring elements. After modifying the list, it checks a condition using another function `func_1`. If the condition is met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The final state of the program involves the list being potentially modified and a printed message indicating whether the condition was met.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the described operations. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The operation in the while loop is incorrect. The operation should be:
     * `list[i - 1] -= 1`
     * `list[i] -= 2`
     * `list[i + 1] -= 1`
   - However, the code incorrectly uses:
     * `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     * `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     * `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - This means the operation is not correctly reducing the values as described in the problem statement.

2. **Logic for Checking Completion**:
   - The code uses `func_1` to check if all elements are zero after the operations. However, the logic in `func_2` is flawed, so this check is not reliable.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the initial values in the array make it impossible to perform the operations as described. For example, if the first or last element is non-zero and there are not enough operations to reduce them to zero, the code should return "NO".

4. **Example of Incorrect Behavior**:
   - Consider the input `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`. The correct sequence of operations should be:
     1. Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`
     2. Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`
     3. Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`
     4. Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - However, the provided code does not correctly perform these operations and will likely return "NO" for this input.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
