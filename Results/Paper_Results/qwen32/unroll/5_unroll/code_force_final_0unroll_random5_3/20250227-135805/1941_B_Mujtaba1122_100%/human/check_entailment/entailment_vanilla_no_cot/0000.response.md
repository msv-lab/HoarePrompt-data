Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are a few issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect operation logic**: The operation described in the problem is to choose an index `i` and perform the following:
   - `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`
   - `a_i = a_i - 2`
   - `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`

   However, in `func_2`, the operation is incorrectly implemented as:
   - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
   - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`

   This is not the intended operation. The correct operation should subtract 1 from `list[i - 1]`, 2 from `list[i]`, and 1 from `list[i + 1]` as long as `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` are greater than 0.

2. **Premature termination**: The program prints 'no' and returns as soon as it finds that `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the inner loop. This is incorrect because the program should continue to try other operations on other indices before concluding that it's not possible to make all elements zero.

3. **Output format**: The program should print 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, but it prints 'no' in lowercase and does not handle the case sensitivity as described in the problem statement.

4. **Edge cases**: The program does not handle cases where the array cannot be made zero, such as when the sum of the array elements is odd (since each operation reduces the sum by 4).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_zero(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n < 3:
        return False

    # Check if the sum of the array is divisible by 4
    total_sum = sum(arr)
    if total_sum % 4 != 0:
        return False

    # Try to make all elements zero
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while arr[i] > 1 and arr[i - 1] > 0 and arr[i + 1] > 0:
            arr[i + 1] -= 1
            arr[i] -= 2
            arr[i - 1] -= 1

    # Check if all elements are zero
    return all(x == 0 for x in arr)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, input[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        if can_make_zero(arr):
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version correctly implements the operation logic and checks if it's possible to make all elements zero. It also handles the output format correctly.
