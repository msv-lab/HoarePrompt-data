### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
Rudolf can perform an operation on an array `a` of `n` integers, where the operation involves selecting an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) and modifying the values at positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` as follows:
- `a[i-1] = a[i-1] - 1`
- `a[i] = a[i] - 2`
- `a[i+1] = a[i+1] - 1`

The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using this operation any number of times.

#### Provided Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(list, n)`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2(list, n)`**:
   - This function iterates through the list from index 1 to `n-2`.
   - For each index `i`, it enters a while loop that continues as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`.
   - Inside the loop, it performs the following incorrect operations:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - After the loop, it checks if `list[i-1]` is not zero and prints "no" if it is not.
   - Finally, it uses `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Operation Logic**:
   - The operations inside the while loop are incorrect. The correct operations should be:
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1`
     - `list[i] -= 2`
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1`
   - The current implementation incorrectly multiplies the values by `list[i-1]`, which will not achieve the intended effect of reducing the values by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Logic for Checking Completion**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed due to the incorrect operations, making the final check using `func_1` unreliable.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where the initial values in the array make it impossible to perform the operations as described. For example, if the first or last element is non-zero and there are not enough operations to reduce them to zero, the code should return "NO".

4. **Example of Incorrect Behavior**:
   - Consider the input `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`. The correct sequence of operations should be:
     1. Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`
     2. Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`
     3. Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`
     4. Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - However, the provided code does not correctly perform these operations and will likely return "NO" for this input.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the described operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
