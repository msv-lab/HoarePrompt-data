Functionality: **The function `func_2` takes a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` as input, where `n` is the length of the list and is between 3 and 2 * 10^5. It modifies the list by potentially reducing the values of elements from index 1 to `n-2` based on the values of their neighboring elements. After modifying the list, it checks a condition using another function `func_1`. If the condition is met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The final state of the program involves the list being potentially modified and a printed message indicating whether the condition was met.**
