### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment to determine the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine if we can make all elements of an array equal to zero by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The operation allows us to choose an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and then:
1. Decrease \( a_{i-1} \) by 1.
2. Decrease \( a_i \) by 2.
3. Decrease \( a_{i+1} \) by 1.

#### Program Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1`
This function checks if all elements in the array are zero. It iterates through the array and returns `False` if it finds any non-zero element. If all elements are zero, it returns `True`. This function is correctly implemented.

#### Function 2: `func_2`
This function attempts to apply the described operation to make all elements zero. It iterates through the array from the second element to the second-to-last element (i.e., indices 1 to \( n-2 \)).

For each element at index \( i \):
- It repeatedly applies the operation as long as \( a_i > 1 \) and both \( a_{i-1} \) and \( a_{i+1} \) are greater than 0.
- The operation is applied by reducing \( a_{i+1} \) by \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \) by \( 2 \times a_{i-1} \), and \( a_{i-1} \) by \( a_{i-1} \).

### Issues with `func_2`:
1. **Incorrect Operation Application**: The operation should decrease \( a_{i-1} \) by 1, \( a_i \) by 2, and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, not by the value of \( a_{i-1} \). The current implementation incorrectly uses the value of \( a_{i-1} \) for the decrements.
2. **Early Termination**: The function prints "no" and returns as soon as it encounters a non-zero element after the first index, which is incorrect. It should continue processing the rest of the array.
3. **Logic Flaw**: The function does not ensure that the operation can be applied in a way that eventually makes all elements zero. It only checks if the operation can be applied repeatedly until \( a_i \le 1 \), which is not sufficient.
4. **Output Handling**: The function prints "YES" or "NO" directly, which is not ideal for handling multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the operation and does not ensure that all elements can be made zero. It also handles output in a way that is not suitable for multiple test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the program. The program does not correctly implement the required operation and fails to ensure that all elements can be made zero. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
