To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the range `(1, n - 1)` must be valid, meaning it must contain at least one integer. This implies that the start of the range (1) must be less than the end of the range (`n - 1`).

Therefore, the condition for the loop to execute is:
\[ 1 < n - 1 \]
\[ 2 < n \]
\[ n > 2 \]

Given that `n` is already defined to be in the range \(3 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), this condition is inherently satisfied. However, we still need to ensure that `i` is correctly initialized to 1, as the loop starts with `i = 1`.

Thus, the only state that needs to be explicitly mentioned for the loop to execute is the value of `n` (which is already given to be within the specified range) and the initial value of `i` which should be 1.

State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and `i` is 1**
