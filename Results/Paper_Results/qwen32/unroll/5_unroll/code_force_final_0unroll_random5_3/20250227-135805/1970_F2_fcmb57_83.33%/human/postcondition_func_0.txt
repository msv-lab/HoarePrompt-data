The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `a` is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field and `b` is a tuple representing a change in coordinates (dx, dy). The function returns a new tuple representing the updated coordinates by adding `dx` and `dy` to `a`. However, the provided annotations and return postconditions contain inaccuracies since `a` is not split into `x` and `y`, and `b` should be unpacked correctly. Given the actual code, the function seems to intend to return `(a + dx, a + dy)`, but the input parameters do not align with the described functionality.
