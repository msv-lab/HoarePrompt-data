a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field such that 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd, b is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field such that 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd. The field is described by N lines of M pairs of characters separated by spaces, where each pair can be ".." (empty cell), "R0" to "R9" (red player), "B0" to "B9" (blue player), "RG" (red goal), "BG" (blue goal), ".Q" (Quaffle), or ".B" (Bludger). There is exactly one Quaffle, zero or one Bludger, and between one and five goals for each team. The number of players (P) for each team is between 1 and 10. The next line contains an integer T (0 <= T <= 10000) representing the number of steps in the game. The following T lines each describe an action in the format specified in the problem description.
