The code snippet `x, y = a` assigns the value of `a` to the variables `x` and `y`. Given that `a` is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field, both `x` and `y` will now hold the value of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field such that 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd; `b` is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field such that 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd; `x` is equal to `a`; `y` is equal to `a`.**
