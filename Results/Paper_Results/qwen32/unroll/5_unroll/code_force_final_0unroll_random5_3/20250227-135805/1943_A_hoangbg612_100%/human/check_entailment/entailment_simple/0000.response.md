### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to understand the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob and how they would affect the final MEX of the array `c`.

#### Alice's and Bob's Strategies:
1. **Alice's Goal**: Maximize the MEX of `c`.
2. **Bob's Goal**: Minimize the MEX of `c`.

#### Key Observations:
- **MEX Definition**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- **Game Dynamics**: Since Alice goes first and both players play optimally, Alice will try to ensure that the smallest missing number (MEX) remains as large as possible, while Bob will try to ensure it remains as small as possible.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Sorting the Array**: The array `N` is sorted. This is a reasonable first step as it helps in easily identifying the smallest missing number.
2. **Tracking Occurrences**: A dictionary `M` is used to count the occurrences of each number in the array.
3. **Determining MEX**:
   - The variable `cur` is used to track the current MEX.
   - The loop iterates through the sorted array, updating `cur` to the next smallest number that hasn't been fully utilized (i.e., `M[cur]` is less than the number of times it appears).
   - If the sum of values in `M` equals `S` (the size of the array), it means all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present, so `cur` is incremented by 1.
4. **Handling Special Cases**:
   - The program checks if there are at least two numbers with exactly one occurrence. If so, it sets `cur` to the second smallest such number. This seems to be an attempt to handle cases where there are multiple small gaps in the sequence, but it doesn't align with the optimal strategy for maximizing MEX.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Handling Multiple Occurrences**: The logic for handling numbers with multiple occurrences and determining the MEX seems flawed. The program does not correctly account for the optimal moves by Alice and Bob.
- **Incorrect Handling of Gaps**: The program incorrectly sets `cur` to the second smallest number with one occurrence, which does not necessarily maximize the MEX.
- **Lack of Optimal Strategy Simulation**: The program does not simulate the optimal moves of both players, which is crucial for determining the correct MEX.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob, and thus does not always produce the correct MEX for the given array.

**Correctness: False**
