Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Alice and Bob play a game where Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the final array `c`, and Bob wants to minimize it.
2. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice starts by picking an element from `a`, appending it to `c`, and deleting it from `a`.
   - Bob then picks an element from `a` and deletes it from `a`.
   - The game continues until `a` is empty.
3. **MEX Definition**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided program and see if it correctly implements the logic to find the optimal MEX.

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = -1
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        cnt = []
        for k in M.keys():
            if M[k] == 1:
                cnt.append(k)
        if len(cnt) >= 2:
            cur = cnt[1]
        print(cur)
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `N` is sorted. This helps in easily finding the smallest missing number (MEX).

3. **Dictionary `M`**:
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count the occurrences of each number in `N`.

4. **Finding the MEX**:
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to `-1`.
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates `cur` to the smallest number not yet encountered in `M`.
   - If a number greater than `cur + 1` is found, it breaks the loop and sets `cur` to `cur + 1`. This is because the smallest missing number would be `cur + 1`.

5. **Adjustments Based on Counts**:
   - The program checks if the total count of all elements in `M` equals `S`. If yes, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then collects all keys in `M` that have a count of 1 into the list `cnt`.
   - If there are at least two such keys, it sets `cur` to the second smallest key in `cnt`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for adjusting `cur` based on the counts in `M` and the list `cnt` seems incorrect. The program is not correctly simulating the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
- The program does not correctly account for the optimal strategies of both players to maximize or minimize the MEX.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly determine the optimal MEX by simulating the moves of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

**Correctness: False**
