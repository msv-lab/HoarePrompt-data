### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to closely examine the logic and see if it aligns with the problem's requirements. The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` after the game where Alice and Bob play optimally.

1. **Sorting the Array:** The program starts by sorting the array `N`. This is a logical step as it helps in easily identifying the smallest non-negative integers that are missing.

2. **Tracking Frequencies:** It uses a dictionary `M` to keep track of the frequencies of numbers in the array `N`.

3. **Determining `cur`:** The variable `cur` is used to track the current MEX. The loop iterates through the sorted array and updates `cur` if it encounters a number greater than `cur + 1`. This ensures that `cur` remains the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c` after Alice's turns.

4. **Checking Full Coverage:** After the loop, the program checks if all numbers from `0` to `cur` are present in the array `N`. If they are, `cur` is incremented by 1.

5. **Handling Single Occurrences:** The program then checks for numbers that appear only once in the array. If there are at least two such numbers, it sets `cur` to the second smallest of these numbers. This step seems to be an attempt to handle cases where Bob's strategy might affect the final MEX, but it's not entirely clear if this is the optimal strategy.

### Analysis:

- **Optimal Strategy:** The provided code does not fully capture the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. The code seems to focus more on Alice's strategy but does not account for Bob's optimal moves.
  
- **Edge Cases:** The logic for handling single occurrences (`if len(cnt) >= 2`) is unclear and might not be correct in all scenarios. For example, if the array contains many repeated elements, this logic might not yield the correct MEX.

- **MEX Calculation:** The MEX calculation should be based on the final state of the array `c` after all moves, considering both players' strategies. The provided code does not simulate the game turns explicitly, which might lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly simulate both players' optimal strategies and might not always compute the correct MEX for the final array `c`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
