In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_` and `T`. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value of `T`.

For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted because it is not used in the loop body and is automatically assigned by the `range` function during each iteration.

State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0**
