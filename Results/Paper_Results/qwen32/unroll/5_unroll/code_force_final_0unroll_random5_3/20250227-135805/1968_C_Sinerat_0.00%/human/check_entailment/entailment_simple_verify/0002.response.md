Reasoning: The program correctly constructs the array `a` such that each `a_i` is within the range [1, 1,000,000,000] and satisfies the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. The annotations and the example test cases verify that the program meets the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
