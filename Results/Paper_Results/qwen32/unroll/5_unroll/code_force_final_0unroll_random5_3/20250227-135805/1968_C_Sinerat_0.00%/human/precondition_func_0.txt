The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in the array a. The next line contains n-1 integers x_2, x_3, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) which are the elements of the array x. The total number of elements in all test cases combined does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
