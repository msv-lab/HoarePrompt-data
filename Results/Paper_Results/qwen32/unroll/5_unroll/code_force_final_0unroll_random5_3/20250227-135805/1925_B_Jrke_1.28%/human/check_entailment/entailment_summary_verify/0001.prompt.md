You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the largest integer less than or equal to `x` that has a divisor (other than 1) which is also less than or equal to `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems with positive integer difficulties such that the sum of the sub-problems equals `x`. The goal is to maximize the balance, which is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of the sub-problems.

### Key Observations:
1. The maximum balance is a divisor of `x`.
2. The maximum possible balance `ans` cannot be greater than `x // n` because each sub-problem must have a positive integer difficulty, and if the balance were greater than `x // n`, it would be impossible to partition `x` into `n` parts with each part having at least that balance.
3. The program iterates through potential divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` to find the largest possible balance that is also less than or equal to `x // n`.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
3. It calculates `k = x // n`, the maximum possible balance.
4. If `k == 1`, it immediately prints `1` because the smallest possible balance is `1` and no larger balance is possible.
5. If `k > 1`, the program searches for the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`:
   - It skips even numbers if `x` is odd, starting from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)`.
   - It checks divisors up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i` of `x`, it checks if `i` or `x // i` is a possible balance (i.e., less than or equal to `k`).
   - It updates `ans` to the maximum of the current `ans` and the valid divisors found.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance. It efficiently checks divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` and ensures that the balance does not exceed `x // n`. The program handles edge cases, such as when `x == n` (where the balance is `1`), and when `x` is a prime number (where the only possible balance is `1` or `x` itself, but `x` is not feasible if `n > 1`).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and handles all the edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
