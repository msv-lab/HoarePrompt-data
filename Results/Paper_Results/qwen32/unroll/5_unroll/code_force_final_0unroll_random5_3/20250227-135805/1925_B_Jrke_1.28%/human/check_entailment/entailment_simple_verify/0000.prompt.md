You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. For each test case, x and n are integers such that 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x, n = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = x // n
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        ans = 1

                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The variables `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `i`, and `l` will have their values from the last iteration of the loop, but since they are local to each iteration, their specific values are not retained after the loop completes. The variable `t` will be 0 after the loop has finished processing all test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Find the maximum balance (GCD of difficulties) for a problemset of `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to `x`.
- **Constraints**:
  - `1 <= t <= 10^3` (number of test cases)
  - `1 <= x <= 10^8` (total difficulty)
  - `1 <= n <= x` (number of sub-problems)

### Analysis of the Program:
The given program attempts to find the maximum balance by iterating through potential divisors of `x` up to its square root. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - If `k = x // n` is 1, it directly prints 1 because the only possible sub-problems would each have a difficulty of 1, resulting in a GCD of 1.

3. **Finding Maximum Balance**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1.
   - It iterates over potential divisors `i` starting from 1 (or 2 if `x` is even) up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `i` divides `x` evenly (`x % i == 0`), it checks if `i` or `x // i` can be a valid sub-problem difficulty (i.e., less than or equal to `k`).
     - It updates `ans` to the maximum of the current `ans` and the valid divisors found.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints the maximum balance found.

### Potential Issues:
- **Handling of Edge Cases**:
  - **Case 1**: When `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than 1, the only possible sub-problem difficulty is 1, leading to a GCD of 1. The program handles this correctly.
  - **Case 2**: When `x` is a perfect square and `n` is 1, the program should return `x` as the balance. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario explicitly.
  - **Case 3**: When `x` is small and `n` is large, the program should return 1 as the balance. The program handles this correctly.
  - **Case 4**: When `x` and `n` are such that `x // n` is greater than 1, the program should find the largest divisor that can be used as a sub-problem difficulty. The program handles this correctly.

### Testing with Examples:
- **Test Case 1**: `x = 10`, `n = 3`
  - Possible sub-problems: [4, 2, 4] or [2, 2, 6] etc. The GCD is 2.
  - The program correctly returns 2.
- **Test Case 2**: `x = 5`, `n = 5`
  - Only possible sub-problems: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The GCD is 1.
  - The program correctly returns 1.
- **Test Case 3**: `x = 420`, `n = 69`
  - Possible sub-problems can have a GCD of 6.
  - The program correctly returns 6.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all the provided test cases correctly and seems to cover the edge cases mentioned. It finds the maximum possible GCD of the sub-problems by iterating through potential divisors and ensuring they can be valid sub-problem difficulties.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly finds the maximum balance by iterating through potential divisors and ensuring they can be valid sub-problem difficulties. It handles various edge cases, including when `x` is a prime number, a perfect square, or when `x // n` is greater than 1.
