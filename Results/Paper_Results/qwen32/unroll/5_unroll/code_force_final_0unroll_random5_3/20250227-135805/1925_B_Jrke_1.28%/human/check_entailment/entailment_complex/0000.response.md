### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if it correctly computes the maximum balance (which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of all sub-problems) for each test case. The approach taken by the program is to find the largest possible divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.

2. **Initial Check**: If `k = x // n` is 1, it directly prints 1 because the only way to split `x` into `n` parts is to have each part with difficulty 1, making the GCD 1.

3. **Finding Divisors**: For other cases, the program searches for the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k` (where `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`). It does this by iterating over possible divisors from 1 to the square root of `x`, incrementing by 2 (to skip even numbers, except when `x` is even).

4. **Updating Answer**: During the iteration, if a divisor `i` of `x` is found and it is less than or equal to `k`, or if `x // i` (the corresponding pair divisor) is less than or equal to `k`, it updates the answer to be the maximum of the current answer and these divisors.

5. **Output**: After processing each test case, it prints the maximum divisor found, which is the maximum balance.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

- **First Test Case**: `x = 10`, `n = 3`
  - `k = 10 // 3 = 3`
  - Divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10
  - Valid divisors less than or equal to 3: 1, 2
  - The largest valid divisor is 2.
  - Output: 2

- **Second Test Case**: `x = 5`, `n = 5`
  - `k = 5 // 5 = 1`
  - The only valid divisor is 1.
  - Output: 1

- **Third Test Case**: `x = 420`, `n = 69`
  - `k = 420 // 69 â‰ˆ 6`
  - Divisors of 420: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420
  - Valid divisors less than or equal to 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
  - The largest valid divisor is 6.
  - Output: 6

### Conclusion:

The program correctly computes the maximum balance for each test case by finding the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
