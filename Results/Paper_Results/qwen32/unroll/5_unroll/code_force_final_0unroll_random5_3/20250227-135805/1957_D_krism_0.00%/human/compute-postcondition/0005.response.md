To determine the output state after the loop execution, let's analyze the loop step by step.

The loop iterates over each element `v` in the list `arr`. For each element `v`, it computes the bitwise XOR of `v` with the last element of the `prefix` list (`prefix[-1]`) and appends the result to `prefix`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (this value is not affected by the loop).
- `n` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 (this value is not affected by the loop).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 (this list is not affected by the loop).
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `prefix` is a list containing a single element, `0`.

After the loop, `prefix` will contain `len(arr) + 1` elements. The first element is the initial `0`, and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point. Specifically, the `i+1`th element of `prefix` will be the XOR of all elements in `arr` from the first to the `i`th element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `prefix` is a list of length `len(arr) + 1` where the i+1th element is the XOR of the first i elements of `arr`.**
