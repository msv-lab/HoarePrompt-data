Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of cities, a list `a` of `n` integers representing the unique, sorted distances of these cities, and an integer `m` representing the number of queries. Each query consists of two integers `x` and `y` representing two different cities. The function returns a list of results for each query, where each result indicates the closest city to city `x` that is not city `y`.**
