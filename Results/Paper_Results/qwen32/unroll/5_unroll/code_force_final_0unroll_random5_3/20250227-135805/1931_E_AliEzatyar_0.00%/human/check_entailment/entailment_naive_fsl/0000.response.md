Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Typographical Error**: The program prints `'Sashah'` instead of `'Sasha'` when Sasha wins. This is a simple typo and should be corrected.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic of the program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. The program attempts to count the number of trailing zeros in the numbers and uses this to determine the winner, but this does not align with the rules of the game.

3. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to count trailing zeros in a number, but the program does not use this information correctly to simulate Anna's and Sasha's turns.

4. **Handling of Leading Zeros**: The problem description mentions that leading zeros are removed when reversing a number. The program does not handle leading zeros when reversing numbers.

5. **Concatenation of Numbers**: The program does not correctly simulate Sasha's turn where he concatenates two numbers. It simply sums the lengths of the numbers and subtracts the count of trailing zeros, which does not reflect the actual concatenation process.

6. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Digits**: The program calculates `total_digits` as the sum of the lengths of the numbers, but it does not account for the fact that the numbers might be concatenated in different ways, affecting the final number of digits.

7. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as when there is only one number in the list or when all numbers are single digits.

Here is one potential case where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Anna
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Sasha
```

In this case, Anna can reverse the number 9 to 9, 56 to 65, and 1 to 1. Sasha can then concatenate 65 and 1 to get 651, which is less than 10^5. Therefore, Anna wins. However, the program incorrectly determines that Sasha wins.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
