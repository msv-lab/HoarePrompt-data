### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine the winner of the game between Sasha and Anna based on the rules described. However, the implementation contains several issues that suggest it does not correctly solve the problem:

1. **Incorrect Functionality of `func_1`:**
   - The `func_1` function is supposed to count the trailing zeros of a number. However, it does not accurately count the trailing zeros because it iterates over the string representation of the number in reverse and breaks at the first non-zero character. This is correct, but the function is not used correctly in the context of the problem.

2. **Incorrect Use of Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program attempts to use the count of trailing zeros to determine the number of digits that can be removed. However, the logic for using this count to determine the winner is flawed. Specifically, the program subtracts the count of trailing zeros from the total number of digits and checks if the result is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. This logic does not accurately reflect the rules of the game, particularly the concatenation step where Sasha can form very large numbers by combining elements in any order.

3. **Incorrect Winner Determination:**
   - The winner determination logic is incorrect. The program incorrectly checks the condition `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` to determine if Sasha wins. This condition does not correctly reflect the game's rules for winning.

4. **Typographical Error:**
   - There is a typo in the output string where `answers[test] = 'Sashah'` should be `answers[test] = 'Sasha'`.

5. **Logic for Concatenation:**
   - The program does not account for the fact that Sasha can concatenate numbers in any order to form very large numbers. The optimal strategy for Sasha would involve forming the largest possible number through concatenation, which is not considered in the current implementation.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the provided rules. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
