Precondition: **num is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing two integers n and m, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
