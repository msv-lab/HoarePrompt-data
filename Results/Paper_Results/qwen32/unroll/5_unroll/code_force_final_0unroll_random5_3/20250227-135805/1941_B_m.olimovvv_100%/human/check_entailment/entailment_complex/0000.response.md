Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and applying the operations specified in the problem statement. However, there are several issues with the logic implemented in the program:

1. The program incorrectly starts the operation from the first element (index 0) and tries to apply the operation with `i` ranging from `0` to `a-2`. The problem statement specifies that the operation can only be performed on indices `i` such that `2 <= i <= n - 1`.

2. The program does not correctly handle the logic for reducing the array to zeros. It incorrectly modifies the array elements in a way that does not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not ensure that the operations are applied in a manner that respects the constraints and achieves the goal of making all elements zero.

3. The program does not correctly check if the array can be reduced to all zeros. It only checks if the last two elements are zero after the operations, which is insufficient to determine the correctness of the solution.

4. The program does not handle the case where the elements of the array are already zero correctly. It should immediately output 'YES' in such cases.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it does not accurately determine whether the array can be reduced to all zeros using the specified operations.

Correctness: **False**
