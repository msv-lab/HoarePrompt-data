You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')

                print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_j satisfies 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, a - 2):

            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
        
    #State: A sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, based on whether the list can be reduced to zeros following the specified rules.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it determines if the list can be reduced to all zeros by applying specific operations: subtracting twice the current element from the next element and the current element from the element after next, while ensuring no element becomes negative. It outputs 'YES' if the list can be reduced to all zeros, otherwise 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all the elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations. There are several issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Indexing and Logic:**
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `a - 2`, but the operation involves indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`. The loop should start from `1` to `a - 2` to correctly apply the operation.
   - The operation `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` and `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` are incorrect because they do not correctly simulate the described operation. Specifically, `b[i]` should be reduced by 1, `b[i+1]` by 2, and `b[i+2]` by 1.

2. **Negative Values Handling:**
   - The program checks if `b[i] < 0` and prints 'NO' if true. However, this check is misplaced and incorrect. The array elements should not be negative, but the operation itself should ensure that the array elements remain non-negative.

3. **Final Check:**
   - The final check `if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0` is not sufficient to determine if all elements are zero. It should check if all elements in the array are zero.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # If the first or last element is not zero, it's impossible to make all elements zero
        if a[0] != 0 or a[-1] != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Try to make all elements zero using the operation
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            op = min(a[i] // 2, a[i - 1], a[i + 1])
            a[i - 1] -= op
            a[i] -= 2 * op
            a[i + 1] -= op
        
        # Check if all elements are zero
        if all(x == 0 for x in a):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

```

This corrected version properly applies the operation and checks if all elements can be made zero. The original program fails to correctly simulate the operation and does not handle all edge cases.
