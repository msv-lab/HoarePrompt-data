### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine if an array can be reduced to all zeros using the specified operation. However, the logic in the current implementation is flawed. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Index Handling:**
   - The loop `for i in range(0, a - 2):` is attempting to iterate over the array indices where the operation can be applied (i.e., `2 <= i <= n-1`), but it should start from `1` in zero-based indexing, not `0`. Therefore, the correct range should be `for i in range(1, a - 1):`.

2. **Incorrect Operation Implementation:**
   - The operation is supposed to subtract `a[i-1] - 1`, `a[i] - 2`, and `a[i+1] - 1` from their respective elements. The current code incorrectly subtracts `b[i] * 2` from `b[i + 1]` and `b[i]` from `b[i + 2]`, and then sets `b[i]` to `0`. This does not follow the defined operation correctly.

3. **Negative Values Handling:**
   - The code checks if `b[i] < 0` after each operation, but this check is unnecessary and incorrect because the operation should not produce negative values if the initial array can be reduced to zeros. The check should be for whether the operation can be applied without making any element negative.

4. **Final Check:**
   - The final check `if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:` is not sufficient to determine if the entire array has been reduced to zeros. All elements should be checked.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the provided program is incorrect. It does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros using the specified operation.

**Correctness: False**
