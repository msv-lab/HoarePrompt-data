You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Example

    5

    +-+-+-
    
    10
    
    --+++++++-
    
    20
    
    +---++++-+++++---++-

Output

    1
    5
    0
    4
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        e = input()
        P = 0
        M = 0
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        print(P - M)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-'.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        
        e = input()
        
        P = 0
        
        M = 0
        
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        
        print(P - M)
        
    #State: a series of printed differences (P - M) for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. The program simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and then prints the difference (P - M). However, the task requires splitting the string into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized, where the penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate that the program is incorrect:

**Input:**
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

While the program happens to produce the correct output for this specific input, it does not provide the correct output for all cases. For example:

**Input:**
```
1
5
-----
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Actual Output:**
```
-5
```

The program incorrectly outputs -5 instead of 5 because it simply calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters without considering the penalty calculation or optimal splitting of the string into subarrays.

Thus, the program is not correct for all potential cases and should be considered incorrect.
