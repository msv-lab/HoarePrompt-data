Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints the difference, which is not the correct approach to find the minimum penalty as defined in the problem statement.

To solve the problem, we need to find an optimal way to split the array into subarrays such that the sum of penalties of the subarrays is minimized. This involves considering the cumulative sums and making decisions based on them to minimize the penalty. The provided program does not implement such logic and therefore does not provide the correct solution.
