Let's go through the reasoning step by step to verify the correctness of the given program.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. Passwords should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit should come after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element is the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password string itself.

2. **Password Validation (function `func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each password.
   - It initializes two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It iterates over the password:
     - If a character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
     - If a character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   - It then iterates over the password again to ensure no digit comes after a letter:
     - It keeps track of the last index where a digit was found (`last_digit_index`).
     - If it encounters a letter after a digit, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If all checks pass, it returns 'YES'.

### Testing the Program:
- **Test Case 1: `12ac`**
  - Digits: `['1', '2']` (sorted)
  - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - No digit after a letter.
  - Result: `YES`

- **Test Case 2: `123wa`**
  - Digits: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
  - Letters: `['w', 'a']` (not sorted)
  - Result: `NO` (due to unsorted letters)

- **Test Case 3: `allllmost`**
  - Digits: `[]` (sorted, trivially)
  - Letters: `['a', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'm', 'o', 's', 't']` (sorted)
  - No digit after a letter.
  - Result: `YES`

- **Test Case 4: `ac123`**
  - Digits: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
  - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - Digit after a letter.
  - Result: `NO`

- **Test Case 5: `011679`**
  - Digits: `['0', '1', '1', '6', '7', '9']` (sorted)
  - Letters: `[]` (sorted, trivially)
  - No digit after a letter.
  - Result: `YES`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for checking whether a password is strong according to the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and examples correctly.

Correctness: **True**
