Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\); `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string; `last_digit_index` is -1.**

In simple terms: The `password` string, `digits` list, and `letters` list remain unchanged. The new variable `last_digit_index` is set to -1.
