You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function checks if a given password string, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, meets specific criteria: all digits must appear before any letters, and both digits and letters must be in non-decreasing order. If the password meets these criteria, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's go through the reasoning step by step to verify the correctness of the given program.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. Passwords should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit should come after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element is the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password string itself.

2. **Password Validation (function `func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each password.
   - It initializes two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It iterates over the password:
     - If a character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
     - If a character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   - It then iterates over the password again to ensure no digit comes after a letter:
     - It keeps track of the last index where a digit was found (`last_digit_index`).
     - If it encounters a letter after a digit, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If all checks pass, it returns 'YES'.

### Testing the Program:
- **Test Case 1: `12ac`**
  - Digits: `['1', '2']` (sorted)
  - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - No digit after a letter.
  - Result: `YES`

- **Test Case 2: `123wa`**
  - Digits: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
  - Letters: `['w', 'a']` (not sorted)
  - Result: `NO` (due to unsorted letters)

- **Test Case 3: `allllmost`**
  - Digits: `[]` (sorted, trivially)
  - Letters: `['a', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'm', 'o', 's', 't']` (sorted)
  - No digit after a letter.
  - Result: `YES`

- **Test Case 4: `ac123`**
  - Digits: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
  - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - Digit after a letter.
  - Result: `NO`

- **Test Case 5: `011679`**
  - Digits: `['0', '1', '1', '6', '7', '9']` (sorted)
  - Letters: `[]` (sorted, trivially)
  - No digit after a letter.
  - Result: `YES`

The program correctly implements the logic for checking whether a password is strong according to the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and examples correctly.
