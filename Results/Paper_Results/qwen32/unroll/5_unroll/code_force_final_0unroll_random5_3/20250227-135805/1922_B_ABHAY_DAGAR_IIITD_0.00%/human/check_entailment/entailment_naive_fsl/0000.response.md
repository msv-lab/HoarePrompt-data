Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of finding the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The program only considers combinations where the lengths of the sticks are the same or pairs of the same length, which is insufficient to determine if a non-degenerate triangle can be formed.

To form a non-degenerate triangle, the triangle inequality theorem must be satisfied. Specifically, for any three sides \(a \le b \le c\), the following must hold:
\[ a + b > c \]

The given program does not implement this check. It only counts combinations of sticks based on their length frequencies, which does not ensure that the selected sticks can form a valid triangle.

Here is an example where the program fails:
Input:
```
1
3
0 1 2
```
Expected Output:
```
1
```
Explanation:
The lengths of the sticks are \(2^0 = 1\), \(2^1 = 2\), and \(2^2 = 4\). The only combination of three sticks is (1, 2, 4). However, 1 + 2 is not greater than 4, so no non-degenerate triangle can be formed. The program should output 0, but it will output 1 because it counts the combination of lengths without checking the triangle inequality.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
