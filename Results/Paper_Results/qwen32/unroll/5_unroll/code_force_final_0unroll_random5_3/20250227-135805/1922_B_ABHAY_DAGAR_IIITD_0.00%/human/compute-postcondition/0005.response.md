Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple consisting of an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
