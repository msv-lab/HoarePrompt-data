Reasoning:
The given Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if the three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the provided problem description.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:
1. The program starts by reading an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, once for each test case.
3. Inside the loop, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.
4. It checks if the digits form a stair by evaluating the condition `a < b < c`. If true, it prints "STAIR".
5. If the digits do not form a stair, it checks if they form a peak by evaluating the condition `a < b > c`. If true, it prints "PEAK".
6. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The program directly matches the conditions specified in the problem description:
- A stair is defined by `a < b < c`.
- A peak is defined by `a < b > c`.

Since the program accurately checks these conditions and outputs the correct string for each case, it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
