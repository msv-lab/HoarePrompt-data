Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The first integer `t` in the list represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the first integer `n` represents the number of sticks, and the subsequent `n` integers represent the lengths of the sticks. The function returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each stick length by 3 across all test cases.**
