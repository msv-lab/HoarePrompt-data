The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input, where the first integer `t` indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the lengths of sticks. The function calculates and returns the sum of how many complete sets of three sticks can be formed from each unique stick length across all test cases.
