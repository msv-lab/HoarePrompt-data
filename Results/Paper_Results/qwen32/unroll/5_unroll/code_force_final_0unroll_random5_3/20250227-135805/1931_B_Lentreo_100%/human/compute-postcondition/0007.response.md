To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the given `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head in the provided code is:

```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range is defined by `n`. Therefore, the state of `i` and `n` need to be adjusted.

Let's analyze the conditions for the loop to execute:

1. **`n`**: This represents the number of test cases in `nums`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.
2. **`i`**: This is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it will be initialized by the `range` function. However, we need to ensure that `n` is such that the loop can initialize `i` properly.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case.
- `n` is the number of test cases in `nums`.
- `total` is the sum of all integers within all inner lists of `nums`.
- `mean` is the integer value of `total` divided by `n`.
- `curr` is 0.

The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 so that the loop can execute. The other variables (`nums`, `total`, `mean`, and `curr`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`nums` is a list of lists, `n` must be greater than 0, `total` is the sum of all integers within all inner lists of `nums`, `mean` is the integer value of `total` divided by `n`, `curr` is 0**
