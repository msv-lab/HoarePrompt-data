#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field, where 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd. b is a list of strings where each string represents a row in the field, and each row contains M pairs of characters separated by spaces, where M is the number of columns in the field, 3 <= M <= 99, and M is odd. Each pair of characters can be ".." for an empty cell, "R0" to "R9" or "B0" to "B9" for players, "RG" or "BG" for goals, or ".Q" for the Quaffle. The list b is followed by an integer T (0 <= T <= 10000) representing the number of steps in the game, and T lines each containing an action as described in the problem statement.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns x + dx, y + dy, but an error occurs due to incorrect unpacking of the list `b` into `dx` and `dy`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is an integer, and `b`, which is a list. It attempts to unpack `b` into `dx` and `dy` and return `x + dx, y + dy`, but this results in an error due to incorrect unpacking.
