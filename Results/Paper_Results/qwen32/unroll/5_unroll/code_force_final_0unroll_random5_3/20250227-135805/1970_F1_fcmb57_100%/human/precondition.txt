The input consists of several parts. First, two integers N and M (3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99, both odd) representing the dimensions of the field. Next, N lines of M pairs of characters describing the initial state of the field. Each pair can be ".." (empty cell), "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9" (players), "RG" or "BG" (goals), or ".Q" (Quaffle). Then, an integer T (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000) representing the number of steps in the game. Following this, T lines describe the actions, each starting with a pair of characters representing the entity performing the action and followed by a character "U", "D", "L", "R" (move up, down, left, right), "C" (catch a ball, followed by the ball's pair of characters), or "T" (throw the Quaffle).
