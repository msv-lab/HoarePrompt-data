Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field `N` and `M`.
   - It then iterates through the field to identify and store the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - Players' positions are stored in the `players` dictionary, goals are stored in the `goals` dictionary, and the Quaffle's position is not explicitly stored but is instead represented as `..` or `.Q` in the field.

2. **Movement Handling:**
   - The program defines a dictionary `mouvements` to map the movement commands ('L', 'R', 'U', 'D') to their respective coordinate changes.
   - It correctly updates the positions of players based on the movement commands using the `func_1` function.

3. **Throwing and Catching:**
   - The program handles the 'C' (catch) command but does not implement it. The catch command is not needed for this version of the problem, so this is acceptable.
   - The program handles the 'T' (throw) command. When a player throws the Quaffle, the program checks if the player is at a goal of the opposite team. If so, it increments the score of the opposite team and prints the appropriate event.

4. **Goal Scoring:**
   - The program checks if the player throwing the Quaffle is at a goal of the opposite team. If so, it increments the score of the opposite team and prints the appropriate event.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal. In such cases, the other team should score a point, but the program does not implement this check.

5. **Final Score Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the final score after all moves have been processed.

### Issues Identified:
- The program does not correctly handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal. It should increment the score of the opposite team in this case.

### Conclusion:
Due to the missing handling of the scenario where a player scores in their own goal, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
