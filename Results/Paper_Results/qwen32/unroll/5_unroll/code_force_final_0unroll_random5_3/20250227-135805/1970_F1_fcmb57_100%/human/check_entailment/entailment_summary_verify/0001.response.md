### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, code, and function summary. We need to ensure that the program correctly handles all specified scenarios, particularly the case where a player scores in their own goal.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions `N` and `M` and processes the field to identify and store the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - The `players` dictionary stores the positions of players, and the `goals` dictionary stores the positions of goals for each team.

2. **Movement Handling:**
   - The program uses the `mouvements` dictionary to correctly update the positions of players based on movement commands.
   - The `func_1` function correctly handles the movement by adding the direction vectors to the player's current position.

3. **Throwing and Catching:**
   - The program correctly handles the 'T' (throw) command. When a player throws the Quaffle, it checks if the player is at a goal of the opposite team and increments the score of the opposite team if true.
   - The `C` (catch) command is not implemented, but this is acceptable for the current problem version as catching is not necessary.

4. **Goal Scoring:**
   - The program correctly checks if the player throwing the Quaffle is at a goal of the opposite team and increments the score and prints the appropriate event.
   - However, the program does not handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal. In such cases, the other team should score a point, but the program does not implement this check.

5. **Final Score Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the final score after all moves have been processed.

### Issues Identified:
- The critical issue is that the program does not handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal. The program should increment the score of the opposite team in this case, which it currently does not do.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies a significant issue with the program: the lack of handling for the scenario where a player scores in their own goal. This is a crucial requirement according to the problem description, and its absence makes the program incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
