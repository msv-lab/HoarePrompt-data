### Reasoning:

Let's go through the program and the given comments to identify any issues or confirm its correctness.

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
    - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field `N` and `M`.
    - It then reads the field configuration, storing the positions of players and goals in dictionaries and lists.
    - The Quaffle's position is not stored separately but is identified during the parsing process.

2. **Movement Handling:**
    - The program reads the number of moves `T` and processes each move.
    - For movement actions (U, D, L, R), the program correctly calls the function `func_1` to update the player's position.
    - The function `func_1` is defined to correctly update the coordinates based on the direction.

3. **Throwing and Catching the Quaffle:**
    - The program correctly checks if the action is to throw the Quaffle and updates the score based on the player's position relative to the goals.
    - It prints the correct goal-scoring events and updates the scores accordingly.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
    - The function `func_1` is defined to take a tuple `a` (representing the current position) and a tuple `b` (representing the movement direction).
    - The function correctly unpacks `b` into `dx` and `dy` and returns the new position `x + dx, y + dy`.

### Issues Identified in the Comments:
- The comment states that an error occurs due to incorrect unpacking of the list `b` into `dx` and `dy`. However, the function `func_1` is actually correctly unpacking `b` into `dx` and `dy` as tuples.
- The comment also mentions that `a` is an integer, but in the function definition, `a` is correctly expected to be a tuple representing the position.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly implemented based on the problem description and the provided comments. The function `func_1` is correctly defined and used to update player positions. The logic for scoring and printing events is also correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
