### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
1. Both strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
2. String `c` does not match the template `t`.

The template `t` is constructed in such a way that:
- If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, the template character at that position is the same lowercase character.
- If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are different, the template character at that position is the uppercase version of the character from `a` (or `b`, since they are different).

The program then checks:
- If `a` and `b` match the constructed template.
- If `c` does not match the constructed template.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Template Construction:**
   - For each position `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
     - If `a[i] == b[i]`, set `template[i] = a[i]`.
     - If `a[i] != b[i]`, set `template[i] = a[i].upper()`.

2. **Matching Check:**
   - For `a` and `b` to match the template:
     - If `template[i]` is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must both equal `template[i]`.
     - If `template[i]` is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must both be different from `template[i].lower()`.
   - For `c` not to match the template:
     - If `template[i]` is lowercase, `c[i]` must not equal `template[i]`.
     - If `template[i]` is uppercase, `c[i]` must be equal to `template[i].lower()`.

The code correctly implements this logic and prints "YES" if the conditions are met and "NO" otherwise.

### Correctness:

The program correctly constructs the template and checks the matching conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c`. It handles all the given constraints and examples as expected.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
