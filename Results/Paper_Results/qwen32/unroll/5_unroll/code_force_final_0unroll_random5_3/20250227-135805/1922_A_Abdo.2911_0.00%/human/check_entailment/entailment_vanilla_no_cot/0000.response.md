Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Template Construction**:
   - The program iterates through each character position of the strings `a` and `b`.
   - If the characters at a given position in `a` and `b` are the same, it adds the lowercase version of that character to the template.
   - If the characters are different, it adds the uppercase version of the character from `a` to the template. This ensures that `a` and `b` will match the template at that position because one will match the lowercase and the other will match the uppercase condition.

2. **Matching Check**:
   - The program then checks if `a` and `b` match the template:
     - If a template character is lowercase, both `a` and `b` must have the same character at that position.
     - If a template character is uppercase, `a` and `b` must have characters different from the lowercase version of the template character at that position.
   - It also checks if `c` does not match the template:
     - If a template character is lowercase, `c` must have the same character at that position.
     - If a template character is uppercase, `c` must have a character different from the lowercase version of the template character at that position.

3. **Output**:
   - If `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, the program outputs "YES".
   - Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

The logic and implementation align with the problem description and handle all edge cases as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
