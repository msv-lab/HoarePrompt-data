To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n`, and then the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Creation:**
   - The program iterates through each character of the strings `a` and `b`.
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, it appends the lowercase version of that character to the `template`.
   - If the characters are different, it appends the uppercase version of the character from `a` to the `template`.

3. **Matching Check:**
   - The program checks if `a` and `b` match the `template`:
     - If the character in the `template` is lowercase, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` match this character.
     - If the character in the `template` is uppercase, it ensures that neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` matches the lowercase version of this character.
   - The program checks if `c` does not match the `template`:
     - If the character in the `template` is lowercase, it checks if `c[i]` matches this character.
     - If the character in the `template` is uppercase, it ensures that `c[i]` matches the lowercase version of this character.

4. **Output:**
   - If `a` and `b` match the `template` and `c` does not, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The logic implemented seems correct based on the problem requirements. The template is constructed based on the conditions given in the problem, and the matching check is performed as described.

**Correctness: True**
