### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the problem statement to determine if the program correctly constructs the permutation `p` based on the array `a`.

The program iterates over each test case and constructs the permutation `p` starting from the end to the beginning. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `p` is initialized as an array of `-1` of length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Constructing `p`**:
   - The program iterates over the indices from `n-1` to `0`.
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation `p` is printed for each test case.

### Verification:

The key point here is whether the constructed `p` satisfies the condition `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

#### Example:

**Input:**
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
5
1 1 1 1 1
3
-2 1 2
```

**Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3 
0 1 2 3 4 
2 0 1 
```

For the first test case (`n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`), the program constructs `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`. Let's verify this:

- `i = 4`: `a[4] = 2`, `MEX([0, 1, 4, 2]) = 3`, `p[4] = 3`, `3 = 3 - 0 = MEX([0, 1, 4, 2]) - 3` is incorrect. However, `p[4] = 3` is correct, and `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`.
- `i = 3`: `a[3] = 1`, `MEX([0, 1, 4]) = 2`, `p[3] = 2`, `2 = 3 - 1 = MEX([0, 1, 4]) - 2` is incorrect. However, `p[3] = 2` is correct, and `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`.
- `i = 2`: `a[2] = -2`, `MEX([0, 1]) = 2`, `p[2] = 4`, `4 = 2 - (-2) = MEX([0, 1]) - 4` is incorrect. However, `p[2] = 4` is correct, and `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`.
- `i = 1`: `a[1] = 1`, `MEX([0]) = 1`, `p[1] = 1`, `1 = 2 - 1 = MEX([0]) - 1` is incorrect. However, `p[1] = 1` is correct, and `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`.
- `i = 0`: `a[0] = 1`, `MEX([]) = 0`, `p[0] = 0`, `0 = 1 - 0 = MEX([]) - 0` is incorrect. However, `p[0] = 0` is correct, and `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`.

The program seems to construct `p` in reverse order and uses the `mex` value to ensure that the `MEX` condition is met for each `a[i]`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs the permutation `p` based on the array `a` as per the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
