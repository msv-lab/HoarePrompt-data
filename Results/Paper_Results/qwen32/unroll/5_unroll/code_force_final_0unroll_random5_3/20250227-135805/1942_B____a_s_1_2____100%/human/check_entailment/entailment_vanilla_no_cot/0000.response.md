Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). The core issue lies in the way the MEX value is being updated and used to compute the permutation \( p \).

The given program iterates from the end of the array \( a \) to the beginning, calculating each element of \( p \) as \( \texttt{MEX} - a[i] \). However, this approach does not guarantee that the MEX value is correctly calculated for each step, as the MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not yet included in the permutation \( p \) up to that point.

To correctly solve the problem, we should iterate from the beginning of the array \( a \) and maintain a set of numbers that have been used in the permutation \( p \). For each element \( a_i \), we should calculate \( p_i \) as \( \texttt{MEX} - a_i \) and then update the set of used numbers to include \( p_i \). The MEX can be efficiently managed using a set or a boolean array to track which numbers have been used.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        used = [False] * n
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            while used[mex]:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            used[p[i]] = True
        
        print(*p)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the MEX value is correctly calculated and updated as we construct the permutation \( p \).
