### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` from the array `a`, we need to carefully analyze the logic and behavior of the program. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program and the annotations provided:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is a reasonable starting point since the maximum MEX for an empty array is `n`.
   - `p` is initialized to a list of `-1` values, which will be overwritten during the computation.

2. **Reverse Iteration**:
   - The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`).
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The core idea is that by iterating in reverse, the program ensures that the MEX is correctly maintained and updated.
   - When calculating `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`, it leverages the fact that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p` up to that point.
   - The update `mex = min(mex, p[i])` ensures that `mex` remains the smallest non-negative integer not yet included in `p`.

4. **Verification with Example**:
   - For the first test case with `n = 5` and `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`:
     - Initialize `mex = 5`.
     - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`.
     - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`.
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`.
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`.
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`.
   - The resulting `p` is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which matches the example output.

5. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations describe the state of the program at key points and confirm that the program correctly calculates `p[i]` and updates `mex`.
   - The annotations also state that the values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged across different test cases, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` for each test case based on the array `a`. The annotations support this conclusion by showing that the program's behavior aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
