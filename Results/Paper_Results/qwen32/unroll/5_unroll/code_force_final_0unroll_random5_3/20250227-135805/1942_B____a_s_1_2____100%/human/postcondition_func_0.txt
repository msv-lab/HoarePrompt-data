The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints a permutation `p` of length `n` for each test case, where each element `p[i]` is determined by the formula `mex - a[i]`, starting from `i = n-1` to `i = 0`, and `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged across different test cases.
