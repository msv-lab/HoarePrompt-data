### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its logic against the problem description and function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
Farmer John provides an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` is defined as:
\[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]
The task is to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` that satisfies this condition.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)
```

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `p` is initialized to a list of `-1` of length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Loop**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = n-1` to `i = 0`.
   - For each `i`, `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`.
   - `mex` is then updated to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

#### Potential Issues:
- The loop iterates from the end of the array to the beginning, which is not the natural way to construct a permutation based on the MEX condition.
- The `mex` is updated to the minimum value of `mex` and `p[i]`, which may not correctly maintain the MEX property for the constructed `p`.

#### Testing the Program:
Let's consider the provided examples and some additional edge cases to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Example 1:
**Input**:
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
5
1 1 1 1 1
3
-2 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
0 1 4 2 3 
0 1 2 3 4 
2 0 1 
```

#### Analysis of Example 1:
- For the first test case, the output `0 1 4 2 3` seems correct.
- For the second test case, the output `0 1 2 3 4` is the identity permutation, which is valid.
- For the third test case, the output `2 0 1` is also valid.

However, let's consider a more complex edge case to ensure the program handles all scenarios correctly.

#### Edge Case:
**Input**:
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
**Expected Output**:
```
0 1 2 3
```
**Explanation**:
- For `i = 3`, `mex = 4`, `p[3] = 4 - 3 = 1`, `mex = min(4, 1) = 1`.
- For `i = 2`, `mex = 1`, `p[2] = 1 - 2 = -1`, `mex = min(1, -1) = -1` (Invalid as `p` should be a permutation of `0, 1, 2, 3`).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle the MEX condition and may produce invalid permutations in certain cases. Specifically, the reverse iteration and the way `mex` is updated do not guarantee that `p` will be a valid permutation that satisfies the given condition for all possible inputs.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we should iterate from the beginning to the end and maintain the MEX value properly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = 0
        used = [False] * n
        for i in range(n):
            while used[mex]:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            used[p[i]] = True
        print(*p)

func()
```

### Final Answer:
The original program fails to construct a valid permutation `p` for all potential cases, especially when the MEX value is not correctly maintained throughout the construction process.

**Final: False**
