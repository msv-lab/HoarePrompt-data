Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it only checks if the current element and the previous element can be rearranged to form a sorted sequence after splitting the previous element, but it does not consider the broader implications of splitting elements and how it affects the entire array.

Here is a counterexample that demonstrates the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4
9 10 11 12
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The array can be transformed as follows:
- Split 10 into 1 and 0, resulting in [9, 1, 0, 11, 12].
- Split 11 into 1 and 1, resulting in [9, 1, 0, 1, 1, 12].
- The array [9, 1, 0, 1, 1, 12] can be rearranged to [0, 1, 1, 1, 9, 12], which is sorted.

However, the provided program will output "NO" for this input because it only checks if the current and previous elements can be rearranged after splitting, without considering the broader implications of splitting and rearranging the entire array.

The program needs to be revised to handle the splitting and rearrangement of elements in a way that considers the entire array, not just adjacent pairs.
