You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; n is the integer input provided (2 <= n <= 50); a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it checks if the list can be rearranged such that each number is non-decreasing by potentially merging adjacent numbers. It prints "YES" if the list can be rearranged in this manner, otherwise "NO".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to determine whether an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits and placing them in the same position in the array.

### Program Analysis
Here's the provided program with comments added for clarity:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
    for _ in range(n):  # Iterate over each test case
        m = int(input())  # Read the length of the array for this test case
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]  # Read the array elements
        ans = True  # Assume the array can be sorted
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):  # Iterate from the end of the array to the beginning
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:  # If the current element is less than the previous element
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]  # Split the previous element and append the current element
                if nums != sorted(nums):  # Check if the resulting array is sorted
                    ans = False  # If not, set ans to False and break out of the loop
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]  # Replace the previous element with the first digit of the split
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])  # Print 'YES' if ans is True, otherwise 'NO'

# The function is not called here, but it's assumed to be called in the environment
```

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Checking:**
   - The program attempts to fix the array by splitting the previous element only when it encounters an inversion (i.e., `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`).
   - However, it only checks if the split operation and the current element can form a sorted sequence, which is not sufficient.
   - The program does not consider the possibility of splitting multiple elements or rearranging elements in a way that could lead to a sorted array.

2. **Incorrect Replacement Logic:**
   - After splitting and checking, the program replaces the previous element with the first digit of the split element (`arr[i - 1] = nums[0]`).
   - This replacement is not always correct and does not account for the full transformation needed to sort the array.

3. **Insufficient Testing:**
   - The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when multiple elements need to be split or when the array can be sorted by splitting elements in a non-consecutive manner.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the described operation. The logic for splitting elements and checking if the array can be sorted is flawed.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
