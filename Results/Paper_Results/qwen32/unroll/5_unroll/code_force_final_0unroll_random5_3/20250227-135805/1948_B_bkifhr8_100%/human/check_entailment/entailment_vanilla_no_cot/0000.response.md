Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the specified operations. The logic for checking if the array can be sorted is flawed. Specifically, the program only checks if splitting the current element and the next element can result in a sorted subarray, but it does not consider the implications of splitting elements earlier in the array or the overall order of the entire array.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue with the program:

Consider the input:
```
1
5
12 3 45 6 78
```
The correct answer is `YES` because you can split `12` to get `[1, 2, 3, 45, 6, 78]` and then split `45` to get `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 78]`, which is sorted. However, the given program will output `NO` because it only checks adjacent elements and does not correctly simulate the process of splitting and sorting the entire array.

A correct approach would involve simulating the splitting process and checking if the resulting array can be sorted. This would require a more comprehensive algorithm that can handle the splitting and sorting of the array correctly.
