You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: Let's analyze the given program and the problem description to identify potential issues.

The problem requires maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing no more than `y` additional vertices (where `y = 0` in this version). The program provided does not consider the possibility of forming triangles with the existing vertices and does not account for the fact that no additional vertices can be chosen (`y = 0`).

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`.
3. It reads the list of `x` vertices Bessie has chosen, sorts them, and initializes a count of triangles.
4. It iterates through the sorted list of vertices to count the number of adjacent vertices with exactly one vertex between them.
5. It also checks the gap between the first and last vertices considering the cyclic nature of the polygon.
6. It prints the count of triangles plus `x - 2`.

The logic in the program assumes that each pair of adjacent vertices with exactly one vertex between them can form a triangle with one of the chosen vertices. This is not always true, as the program does not ensure that the chosen vertices can form non-intersecting triangles.

Let's consider a test case:
```
Input:
1
6 3 0
1 4 5

Expected Output:
1

Explanation:
With vertices 1, 4, and 5 chosen, we can form only one non-intersecting triangle: (1, 4, 5).
```

The program would output `2` because it counts the gaps between vertices 1 and 4, and 4 and 5, but it does not correctly account for the fact that only one triangle can be formed without intersections.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the formation of non-intersecting triangles with the given vertices.
