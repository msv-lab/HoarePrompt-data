The code snippet `b.append(1)` appends the integer `1` to the list `b`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the list `b`. Therefore, we can only infer that after the operation, `b` will have an additional element `1` at the end, regardless of its previous contents.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; n is 7; a is a list of integers derived from the string input by the user; k is an input integer; x is 7; y is 6; c is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]; d is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]; c is equal to d; b is a list with an additional element `1` appended to it.**
