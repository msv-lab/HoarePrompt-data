The code snippet `d = sorted(c)` sorts the list `c` and assigns the sorted list to the variable `d`. Given that `c` is already `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, sorting it does not change its order.

Therefore, the value of `d` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; n is 7; a is a list of integers derived from the string input by the user; k is an input integer; x is 7; y is 6; c is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]; d is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]**.
