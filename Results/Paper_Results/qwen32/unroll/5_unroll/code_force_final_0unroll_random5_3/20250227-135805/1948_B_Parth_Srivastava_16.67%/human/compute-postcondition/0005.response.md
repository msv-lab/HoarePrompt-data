The code snippet sets `n` to 0, which overrides the previous value of `n` (which was an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50). The values of `t`, `a`, `k`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is 0; `a` is a list of integers derived from the string input by the user; `k` is an input integer; `x` is 0; `y` is 0.**
