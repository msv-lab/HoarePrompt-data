### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to determine if a given array can be sorted in non-descending order by repeatedly breaking down any element that is at least 10 into its individual digits. However, the implementation of the function `func_1` contains logical flaws that prevent it from correctly solving the problem.

Here are the issues:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Elements Greater Than 10**: The function does not properly handle the insertion of digits from numbers greater than 10. It only checks if the tens digit is greater than or equal to the last element in the list `c` before deciding whether to split the number. This is insufficient and can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Inadequate Comparison Logic**: The function does not correctly compare the digits of a number to ensure that the resulting list remains sorted after splitting. For example, if a number `19` is encountered after a `2`, the function should split `19` into `1` and `9`, but it does not account for the fact that `1` should be inserted before `2`, which would make the list unsorted.
3. **Lack of Iterative Splitting**: The function does not iteratively split numbers until the entire list is sorted. It only performs a single pass over the list, which is insufficient for cases where multiple splits are required to achieve a sorted list.

### Correctness:

Given the logical flaws in the implementation of `func_1`, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
