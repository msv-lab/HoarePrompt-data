Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the described operation any number of times. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted or if there are any decreasing elements, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by swapping a prefix with a suffix.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists a point in the array where we can split it into two parts such that the second part followed by the first part is sorted. This involves finding a point where the array can be split into two parts where the first part is the largest possible suffix that is non-decreasing and the second part is the smallest possible prefix that is non-decreasing, and then checking if the concatenation of these two parts in reverse order is sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Find the longest non-decreasing suffix
    suffix_start = n - 1
    while suffix_start > 0 and arr[suffix_start - 1] <= arr[suffix_start]:
        suffix_start -= 1
    
    # Check if the array can be split into two parts such that the second part followed by the first part is sorted
    if suffix_start == 0:
        return 'Yes'  # The whole array is non-decreasing
    
    # Check if the prefix before the suffix is non-decreasing
    for i in range(suffix_start - 1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            return 'No'
    
    # Check if the last element of the prefix is less than or equal to the first element of the suffix
    if suffix_start < n and arr[suffix_start - 1] > arr[suffix_start]:
        return 'No'
    
    return 'Yes'
```

The rest of the program remains the same.
