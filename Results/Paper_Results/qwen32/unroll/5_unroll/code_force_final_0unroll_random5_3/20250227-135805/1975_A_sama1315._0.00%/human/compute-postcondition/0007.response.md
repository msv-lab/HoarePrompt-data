To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables and what the final state will be.

Here is a breakdown of the loop:
1. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
2. For each iteration:
   - `n` is set to the integer value of `data[index]`, and `index` is incremented by 1.
   - `arr` is set to a list of integers derived from the next `n` elements in `data`, and `index` is incremented by `n`.
   - `result` is computed by calling `func_1(arr)`.
   - `result` is appended to the `results` list.

Since `func_1(arr)` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we can't compute the exact values of `result` for each iteration. However, we can describe the state of the variables after the loop completes.

- `arr` will be the last list of integers obtained from `data` in the last iteration of the loop.
- `index` will be the position in `data` right after the last list of integers for the last iteration.
- `results` will be a list containing the results of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration of the loop.
- `t`, `data`, and the initial state of `arr` and `index` remain unchanged except as described above.

Given the initial state and the loop behavior, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`arr` is the last list of integers obtained from `data` in the last iteration; `index` is the position right after the last list of integers in `data`; `results` is a list of results from `func_1(arr)` for each iteration; `t` and `data` remain unchanged.**
