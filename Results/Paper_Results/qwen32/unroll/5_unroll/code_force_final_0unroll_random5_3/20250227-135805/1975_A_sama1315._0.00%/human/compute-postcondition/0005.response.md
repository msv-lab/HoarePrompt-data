The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. The other variables (`arr`, `data`, `index`, and `t`) are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `results` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element in `arr` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**
