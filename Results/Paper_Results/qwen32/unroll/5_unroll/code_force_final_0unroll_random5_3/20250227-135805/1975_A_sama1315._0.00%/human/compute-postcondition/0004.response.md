Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element in `arr` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`arr`, `data`, `t`) remain unchanged.
