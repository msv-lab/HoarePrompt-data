Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
We need to determine if a subarray of `c` is "good" based on the conditions:
1. The sum of the subarray equals the sum of another array `b` of the same length.
2. Each element in the subarray is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
3. All elements in `b` are positive.

### Key Observations:
- Since `b_i > 0` for every index `i`, the smallest possible sum of `b` with length `m` is `m` (when all elements are 1).
- For a subarray to be "good", the sum of the subarray must be at least `m` (the length of the subarray) because the sum of `b` must be at least `m`.
- If the subarray contains any element `1`, we can decrease it to `2` in `b` and decrease the sum of `b` by `1` while keeping the sum of `a` unchanged. Thus, we need at least `sum(subarray) - (number of 1s in the subarray) >= length of the subarray`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these observations:
1. It calculates two prefix arrays:
   - `ones[i]` which is the count of `1`s in the subarray from index `1` to `i`.
   - `sum[i]` which is the sum of the subarray from index `1` to `i` minus the number of elements in the subarray (essentially, the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray).
2. For each query, it calculates the number of `1`s and the adjusted sum for the subarray.
3. It checks if the adjusted sum is at least the length of the subarray minus the number of `1`s. If so, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Program Correctness
- The program correctly calculates the number of `1`s and the adjusted sum for each subarray.
- The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` simplifies to `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`, which is equivalent to `sumInRange - onesInRange >= r - l + 1`. This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray minus the number of `1`s is at least the length of the subarray, which is necessary for the subarray to be "good".

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
