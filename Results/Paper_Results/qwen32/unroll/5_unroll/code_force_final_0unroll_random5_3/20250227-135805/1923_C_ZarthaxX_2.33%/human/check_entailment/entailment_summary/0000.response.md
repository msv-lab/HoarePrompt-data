### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to check if a subarray is "good" according to the problem statement.

1. **Initialization and Preprocessing**:
   - The program initializes two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to store cumulative counts and sums. 
   - `ones[i]` stores the number of 1's in the subarray from the start up to the i-th element.
   - `sum[i]` stores the sum of the subarray from the start up to the i-th element, but with each element decreased by 1.

2. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the number of 1's (`onesInRange`) and the adjusted sum (`sumInRange`) for the subarray from index `l` to `r`.
   - The logic to determine if the subarray is "good" is based on the condition: `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`.
   - This condition is derived from the requirement that the sum of the subarray must be equal to the sum of a different array `b` where each element is positive and different from the corresponding element in the subarray.

3. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If the subarray consists of a single element (`l == r`), the program immediately prints 'NO' because it is impossible to create a different array `b` with a single element that satisfies all conditions.

### Analysis of the Condition:
The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` can be simplified to `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`. This means:
- `onesInRange` is the number of 1's in the subarray.
- `(r - l + 1)` is the length of the subarray.
- `sumInRange` is the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray (since each element in `sum` is decreased by 1).

The condition essentially checks if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements can accommodate the scenario where all 1's are changed to 2's (or greater) and other elements are changed to different positive values.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the provided conditions and handles the special case of single-element subarrays appropriately.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
