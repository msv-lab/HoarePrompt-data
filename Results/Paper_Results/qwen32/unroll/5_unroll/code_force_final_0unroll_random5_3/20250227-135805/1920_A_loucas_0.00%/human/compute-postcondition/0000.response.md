`loop` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, and the constraints remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, each constraint is described by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, all pairs (a, x) are distinct, and `loop` is an input integer.
