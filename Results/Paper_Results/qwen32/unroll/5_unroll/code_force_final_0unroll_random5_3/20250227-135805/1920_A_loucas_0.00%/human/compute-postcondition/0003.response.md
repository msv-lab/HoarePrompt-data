Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of constraints, where 2 <= n <= 100. Each constraint is described by a pair of integers (a, x), where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2. All pairs (a, x) are distinct. The function returns an output based on these constraints for each test case.**
