Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. Each constraint is described by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2. All pairs (a, x) are distinct.**
