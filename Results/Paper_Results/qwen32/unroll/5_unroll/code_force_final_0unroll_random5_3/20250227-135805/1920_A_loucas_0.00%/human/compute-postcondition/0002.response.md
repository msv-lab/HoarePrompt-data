To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the provided loop and how it processes the input data.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Outer Loop Iteration (`for iterable in range(loop)`):**
   - This loop runs `loop` times. For each iteration, it reads a new set of constraints.

2. **Inner Loop Iteration (`for iterable2 in range(innerLoop)`):**
   - This loop reads `innerLoop` number of constraints for each outer loop iteration.
   - Each constraint is a pair of integers (a, x):
     - If `a` is 1, `x` is added to the `big` list.
     - If `a` is 2, `x` is added to the `less` list.
     - If `a` is 3, `x` is added to the `no` list.

3. **Finding the Number (`num`):**
   - After collecting all constraints for a given iteration, the code finds a number `num` that satisfies the following conditions:
     - `num` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list.
     - `num` is less than the minimum value in the `less` list.
     - `num` is not in the `no` list.
   - If such a number is found, it is printed. If no such number exists, `num` remains 0 (which is not explicitly handled but implied by the logic).

4. **Output:**
   - For each outer loop iteration, the number `num` is printed.

Given the above analysis, the output state after all the executions of the loop will consist of the printed values of `num` for each iteration of the outer loop.

Since we don't have specific values for `loop`, `innerLoop`, and the constraints (a, x), we can't provide exact values for `num`. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the printed values.

Output State: **The output will be the sequence of numbers `num` printed for each iteration of the outer loop, where `num` is the first integer greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list, less than the minimum value in the `less` list, and not in the `no` list. If no such number exists, nothing is printed for that iteration.**

Since the problem statement asks for the output state in a specific format and we don't have concrete input values, we can't provide a more specific output. However, the format we need to follow is:

Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **A sequence of numbers printed for each iteration of the outer loop, where each number satisfies the conditions specified in the loop.**
