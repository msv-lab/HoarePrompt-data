### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements and the function summary.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We need to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`.
- The total amount of water is divisible by `n`, so the target amount of water for each container is `total_water / n`.
- The pouring operation can only move water from left to right.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it performs the following steps:
1. It initializes `last` to the last element of the list `nums`.
2. It initializes `curr` to 0.
3. It iterates through each element `i` in `nums`, and if `i` is not zero, it adds `i - last` to `curr`.
4. If `curr` is 0, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program does not calculate the target water level (`total_water / n`). Instead, it uses the last element of the list to compute `curr`.
2. **Misunderstanding the Target**: The program does not check the cumulative difference from the target water level. Instead, it checks the cumulative difference from the last element.
3. **Incorrect Condition**: The condition `if i != 0` is unnecessary and does not contribute to the correct logic of the problem.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Calculate Target**: Compute the target water level `target = total_water / n`.
2. **Check Cumulative Difference**: Iterate through the list and maintain a running cumulative difference between the actual water and the target water. If the cumulative difference is zero by the end, it is possible to balance the water levels.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary states that the program checks if the sum of differences between each non-zero element and the last element of the list equals zero. This does not align with the correct approach needed to solve the problem.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if the water levels can be balanced. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
