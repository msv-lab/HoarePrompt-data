Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The logic used in the program is flawed and does not accurately simulate the operation described in the problem statement.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if we can redistribute the water such that each container ends up with the same amount, which is the total amount of water divided by the number of containers. The key observation is that for each container, the cumulative sum of the differences between the current amount of water and the target amount should not go negative at any point when moving from left to right. This ensures that we can always pour water from a container with more than the target amount to a container with less than the target amount.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        target = sum(nums) // n
        balance = 0
        possible = True
        for i in range(n):
            balance += nums[i] - target
            if balance < 0:
                possible = False
                break
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This program calculates the target amount of water each container should have, then iterates through the containers, maintaining a balance of water. If at any point the balance goes negative, it means we cannot redistribute the water to meet the target, and we output "NO". Otherwise, we output "YES".
