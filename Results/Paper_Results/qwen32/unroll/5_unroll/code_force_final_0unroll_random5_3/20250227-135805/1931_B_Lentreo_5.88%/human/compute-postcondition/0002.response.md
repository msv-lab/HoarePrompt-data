To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand what the loop does and how it affects the variables involved.

The given code processes `t` test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers.
2. It initializes `last` to the last element of the list and `curr` to 0.
3. It iterates over the list of integers, and for each non-zero integer `i`, it adds `(i - last)` to `curr`.
4. After the loop, it checks if `curr` is zero. If it is, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The variables `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr` are affected within the loop. However, after all iterations, the only variable that retains a meaningful state in the context of the problem is the output printed for each test case ('YES' or 'NO').

Since the problem asks for the output state after all executions of the loop, we should consider the cumulative effect on the output. The output for each test case is either 'YES' or 'NO', and these outputs are printed sequentially.

Therefore, the output state can be described as a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case.

Given the format requirement, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **A series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case, based on whether the condition `curr == 0` is met.**
