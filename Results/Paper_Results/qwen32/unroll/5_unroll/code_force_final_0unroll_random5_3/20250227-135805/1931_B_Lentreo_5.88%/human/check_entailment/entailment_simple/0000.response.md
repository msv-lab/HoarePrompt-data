Reasoning:  
The given program is incorrect. The logic within the function does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Here's why:

The program calculates `curr` by iterating through the list of water amounts and adding the difference between each element and the last element of the list. This approach does not accurately reflect the requirements of the problem. To determine if it is possible to equalize the water in all containers, the correct approach would be to check if the cumulative sum of differences from the average (which is the target amount of water in each container) can be balanced out through the allowed operations.

The correct logic should involve checking if, at each step, the cumulative sum of differences from the target (which is the total sum divided by `n`) can be adjusted to zero by the end of the iteration. The current implementation only checks the difference from the last element, which is not sufficient to ensure that the water can be evenly distributed.

Correctness: **False**
