Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array to maximize this sum. The optimal arrangement to maximize the beauty is to sort the array in ascending order and then compute the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + ... + (a_n - a_{n-1}).

The provided program instead calculates a different sum, which is the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. This does not maximize the beauty of the array as described in the problem statement.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            kq += a[i] - a[i - 1]
        print(kq)

func()
```

This corrected version sorts the array and then computes the sum of differences between consecutive elements, which is the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array.
