### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the maximum "beauty" of an array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements when the array is sorted in some order. The key insight is that to maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. 

The given solution sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. This approach effectively maximizes the beauty because it pairs the largest possible elements with the smallest possible elements, thereby maximizing the individual differences.

Let's break down the steps of the program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
2. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Calculating the Beauty**: The program then calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, etc. This is done using the loop `for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1): kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`.
4. **Output**: For each test case, the calculated beauty value is printed.

This approach ensures that the differences are maximized, thus providing the correct maximum beauty for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting and then calculating the sum of the differences between paired elements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
