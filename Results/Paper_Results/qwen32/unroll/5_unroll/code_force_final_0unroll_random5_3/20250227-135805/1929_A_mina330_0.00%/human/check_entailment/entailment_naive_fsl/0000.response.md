Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The current implementation sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. However, this approach does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty.

To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. The optimal strategy is to arrange the elements in an alternating pattern of the largest and smallest remaining elements. This ensures that the differences are maximized.

Here is a counterexample where the current program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 3 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
One optimal arrangement is `[1, 4, 2, 3]`, which gives a beauty of `(4 - 1) + (2 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2`. However, another optimal arrangement is `[1, 4, 3, 2]`, which gives a beauty of `(4 - 1) + (3 - 4) + (2 - 3) = 3 - 1 - 1 = 2`. But the best arrangement is `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]` which gives `(4 - 1) + (3 - 2) + (3 - 1) = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6`.

The provided program would not generate this optimal arrangement and thus would not produce the correct maximum beauty for this input.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
