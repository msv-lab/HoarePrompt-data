t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, an integer k such that 1 <= k <= n, and a list of lists of integers a where each inner list a_ij contains n integers each (1 <= a_{ij} <= n, all a_{ij} are different). The sum of n * k for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that all the authors of the screenshots are different.
