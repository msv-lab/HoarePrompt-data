Reasoning:  
The provided program calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time based on the given frequencies `a` and `b` and the visibility duration `m`. However, the logic in the program is incorrect. 

The program calculates `ans` as `m // a + m // b + 2`, which does not correctly account for the simultaneous visibility of fireworks from both installations. The correct approach should involve calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of simultaneous fireworks launches and then calculating how many fireworks from each installation are visible during that period.

The example provided in the problem description is not sufficient to catch this error, but the logic flaw is evident when considering the third test case. The program outputs `17` for the third test case, but as shown in the problem statement, the correct answer is `17` fireworks visible at `112` minutes, which involves a more complex calculation than what the program currently does.

The correct formula to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously should involve the following steps:
1. Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine how many fireworks from each installation are visible during the LCM period.
3. Adjust for the overlap of visibility periods.

Given the current logic, the program does not correctly handle the simultaneous visibility of fireworks and thus does not provide the correct answer in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
