Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of each operation is defined as the length of the chosen substring.

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: This function reads a binary string, processes it, and calculates a value `ans` which is printed. The processing involves counting the number of '1's encountered (`n`), and for each '0' encountered after a sequence of '1's, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This seems to be calculating the sum of the lengths of all possible substrings ending with '0' that could be cyclically shifted to contribute to sorting the string.
2. `func_2`: This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The logic in `func_1` aligns with the problem description. When a '0' is encountered after a sequence of '1's, it signifies that the sequence of '1's needs to be shifted to the right of the '0'. The cost of this operation is the length of the substring that includes the sequence of '1's and the '0', which is `n + 1`. By summing these costs for all such occurrences, the function calculates the minimum total cost to sort the string.

Thus, the logic in both functions together correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
