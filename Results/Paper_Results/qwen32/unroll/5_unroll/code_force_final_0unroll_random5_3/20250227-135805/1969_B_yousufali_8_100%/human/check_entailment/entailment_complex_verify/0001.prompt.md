You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's), and n is initialized to 0 and ans is initialized to 0.
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: s is the user input, n is 1, ans is 5.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 5
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a binary string from user input, processes it, and prints the computed value of `ans`, which represents the sum of counts of consecutive '1's incremented by one each time a '0' is encountered after a sequence of '1's.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to input an integer `t` and then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times. The function itself does not return any value but may perform actions within `func_1` for each iteration.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to sort a binary string `s` in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) using a specific operation. The operation allows us to cyclically shift any substring `s[l] s[l+1] ... s[r]` for a cost of `r - l + 1`. We need to find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

### Solution Analysis
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function processes a single binary string and calculates the minimum cost to sort it.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it calls `func_1()` to process the input string.

Let's focus on `func_1()` to understand how it calculates the minimum cost.

#### Key Logic in `func_1()`
- We iterate through the string `s` and maintain a counter `n` that counts the number of '1's encountered so far.
- Whenever we encounter a '0', and `n` (the count of '1's seen so far) is not zero, we add `n + 1` to the answer `ans`.
  - The logic behind `n + 1` is that to move this '0' past all the '1's encountered so far, we need to perform a cyclic shift on a substring that includes this '0' and all the preceding '1's. The cost of this operation is `n + 1`.

### Correctness Verification
Let's verify the solution with the example provided in the problem statement.

#### Example Walkthrough
1. **Input:** `10`
   - `n = 1` (first character is '1')
   - `ans = 1 + 1 = 2` (second character is '0', and `n` is not zero)
   - Output: `2` (correct)

2. **Input:** `0000`
   - No '1's are encountered, so `ans` remains `0`.
   - Output: `0` (correct)

3. **Input:** `11000`
   - `n = 2` (first two characters are '1's)
   - `ans = 2 + 1 = 3` (third character is '0')
   - `ans = 3 + 2 = 5` (fourth character is '0')
   - `ans = 5 + 3 = 8` (fifth character is '0')
   - Output: `8` (incorrect, expected: `9`)

   The provided solution seems to have an off-by-one error in the calculation for this case.

4. **Input:** `101011`
   - `n = 1` (first character is '1')
   - `ans = 1 + 1 = 2` (second character is '0')
   - `n = 2` (third character is '1')
   - `ans = 2 + 2 = 4` (fourth character is '0')
   - `n = 3` (fifth character is '1')
   - `ans = 4 + 3 = 7` (sixth character is '1')
   - Output: `7` (incorrect, expected: `5`)

5. **Input:** `01101001`
   - `n = 1` (second character is '1')
   - `ans = 1 + 1 = 2` (third character is '1')
   - `n = 2` (fourth character is '0')
   - `ans = 2 + 2 = 4` (fifth character is '1')
   - `n = 3` (sixth character is '0')
   - `ans = 4 + 3 = 7` (seventh character is '0')
   - `ans = 7 + 4 = 11` (eighth character is '1')
   - Output: `11` (correct)

### Conclusion
The solution provided is incorrect. The logic for calculating the cost is flawed, as demonstrated by the incorrect outputs for the test cases `11000` and `101011`.

### Final Answer
Reasoning: The provided solution has incorrect logic for calculating the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
Correctness: **False**
