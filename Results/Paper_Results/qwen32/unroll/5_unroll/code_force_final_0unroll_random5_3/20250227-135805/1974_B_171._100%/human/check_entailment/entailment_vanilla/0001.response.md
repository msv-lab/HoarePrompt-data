### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the first value as the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string (`n`) and the encoded string (`b`).

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - For each encoded string `b`, the program defines a function `func_1` to decode it.
   - Inside `func_1`, it first creates a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them to form the auxiliary string `r`.
   - It then constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
   - Using this mapping, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding mapped character.

3. **Output**:
   - The decoded string for each test case is stored in the `results` list, which is then printed out.

### Verification of Correctness:

- The program correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them to form `r`.
- It accurately maps each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart.
- It applies this mapping to the encoded string to produce the original string `s`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It handles multiple test cases efficiently and produces the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
