You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

    return decoded



- Function Summary: 
The function takes a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `decoded` of the same length, where each character is replaced by its reverse counterpart based on the sorted order of unique characters in `encoded`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code attempts to decode the encoded string `b` by reversing the encoding process. However, there is a crucial mistake in the logic used to map the characters back to their original form.

The problem states that each character in the string `s` is replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r` (which consists of all distinct letters of the string `s` written in alphabetical order). To decode, we need to reverse this mapping:

1. Construct the string `r` from the encoded string `b` by taking all unique characters and sorting them alphabetically.
2. Create a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character of `r` is mapped to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
3. Use this mapping to decode the string `b`.

However, the code provided uses the same mapping logic for decoding as it does for encoding. This is incorrect because the mapping needs to be reversed. Specifically, the line:
```python
char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
```
is correct for encoding, but for decoding, it should map each character in `r` back to its original position, which means the mapping should be the reverse of what is currently implemented.

To fix this, we need to create a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in the reverse order of `r`. This can be achieved by swapping the keys and values in the `char_map` dictionary after constructing it.

Here's the corrected version of the function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]] = unique_chars[i]
    decoded = ''.join((char_map[ch] for ch in encoded))
    return decoded
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all test cases. Since the original code does not handle the decoding correctly, the correctness is **False**.
