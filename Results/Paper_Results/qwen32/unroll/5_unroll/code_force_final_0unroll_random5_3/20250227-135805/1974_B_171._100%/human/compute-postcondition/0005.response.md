The code snippet iterates through each character in the `encoded` string and replaces it with its corresponding value from the `char_map` dictionary, effectively decoding the string. The result is stored in the `decoded` variable.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `encoded` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`; `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its reverse counterpart in the sorted list; `len_unique` is the number of unique characters in `encoded`; `decoded` is a string of length `n` where each character is the reverse counterpart of the corresponding character in `encoded` as per `char_map`.**
