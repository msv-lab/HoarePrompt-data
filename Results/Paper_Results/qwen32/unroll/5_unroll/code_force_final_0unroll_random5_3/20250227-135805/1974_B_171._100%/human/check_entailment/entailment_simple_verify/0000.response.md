### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to decode a string `b` that was encoded by replacing each character in the original string `s` with its symmetric character from the string `r`. The string `r` is constructed by taking all distinct characters from `s` and sorting them alphabetically.

For example, encoding the string `s = "codeforces"`:
1. Construct `r` as `"cdefors"`.
2. Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`:
   - 'c' -> 's'
   - 'o' -> 'e'
   - 'd' -> 'r'
   - 'e' -> 'o'
   - 'f' -> 'f'
   - 'o' -> 'e'
   - 'r' -> 'd'
   - 'c' -> 's'
   - 'e' -> 'o'
   - 's' -> 'c'
3. The encoded string `b` is `"serofedsoc"`.

To decode `b` back to `s`, we need to:
1. Construct `r` as `"cdefors"`.
2. Create a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`:
   - 'c' -> 's'
   - 'd' -> 'r'
   - 'e' -> 'o'
   - 'f' -> 'f'
   - 'o' -> 'e'
   - 'r' -> 'd'
   - 's' -> 'c'
3. Use this mapping to decode `b` back to `s`.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code performs the following steps:
1. Constructs `r` by taking all unique characters from `b` and sorting them alphabetically.
2. Creates a mapping `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`:
   - `char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`
3. Uses this mapping to decode `b` back to `s`.

Let's examine the annotation and the code:
- The annotation states that `char_map` is created such that each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its reverse counterpart in the sorted list. This is correct for both encoding and decoding because the mapping is symmetric.

For example, if `r` is `"cdefors"`:
- The mapping `char_map` will be:
  - 'c' -> 's'
  - 'd' -> 'r'
  - 'e' -> 'o'
  - 'f' -> 'f'
  - 'o' -> 'e'
  - 'r' -> 'd'
  - 's' -> 'c'

Using this mapping to decode `b = "serofedsoc"` will correctly yield `s = "codeforces"`.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment claims that the code is incorrect because it uses the same mapping logic for decoding as it does for encoding. However, this is not accurate. The mapping logic is indeed symmetric, and the code correctly reverses the encoding process.

Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect, and the code is correct.

### Final: **True**
