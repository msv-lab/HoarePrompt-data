To determine the state needed for the for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(n)`. This means that the only variables we can adjust are `i` and `n`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. This is because `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the sequence will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

2. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is the loop variable and is automatically initialized to 0 at the start of the first iteration. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.

3. **Other Variables**: The variables `k`, `arr`, and `pos` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop executes. However, since they are mentioned in the initial state, we should include them in the final state description.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The values of `k`, `arr`, and `pos` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, but they should be included in the state description.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1**
