The code snippet initializes two variables, `low` and `high`, with the values `0` and `n`, respectively. The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos` remain unchanged as they were initially set by the functions `func_1()` and `func_2()`. 

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `pos` is -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`.**
