The code snippet initializes a new set named `st`. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, or `high`. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the introduction of the new set `st`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `pos` is -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set.**
