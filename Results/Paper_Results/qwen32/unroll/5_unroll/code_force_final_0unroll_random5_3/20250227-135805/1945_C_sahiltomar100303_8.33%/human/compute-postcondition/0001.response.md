In the provided task, the loop iterates over a range determined by the variable `t`, which is the number of test cases. The variables `n` and `a` are defined within each iteration of the loop and are not part of the loop head. Therefore, the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The other variables `n` and `a` are defined inside the loop and do not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
