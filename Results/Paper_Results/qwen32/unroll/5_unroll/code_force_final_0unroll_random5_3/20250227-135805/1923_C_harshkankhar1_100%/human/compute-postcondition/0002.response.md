The code snippet initializes a list `b` with `n + 1` zeros. This means that `b` will have a length of `n + 1` with all elements set to `0`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `b`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `q` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is `0` and `a[1:]` contains the integers read from the input; `b` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
