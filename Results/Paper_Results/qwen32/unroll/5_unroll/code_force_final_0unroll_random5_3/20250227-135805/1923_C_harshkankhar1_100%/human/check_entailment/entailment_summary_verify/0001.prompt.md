You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines whether the sum of the elements in a specified range of the list is at least as large as the number of elements in that range that are greater than 1. It outputs "YES" if the condition is met and "NO" otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if a subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]` is "good" based on the following criteria:
1. The sum of the subarray should be equal to the sum of another array `b` of the same length.
2. Each element in the subarray `c` should be different from the corresponding element in `b`.
3. Each element in `b` should be greater than 0.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array `c`), `q` (number of queries), the array `c`, and then `q` queries.

2. **Array `b` Construction:**
   - The program constructs array `b` such that `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of values where each value is `1` if `c[i] > 1` and `2` otherwise.
   - This is done to ensure the sum of `b` is not equal to the sum of `c` unless the subarray has specific characteristics.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of array `c` and `b` using `accumulate` from the `itertools` module.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]` and `b[l_i:r_i+1]` using the prefix sums.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - If the sum of `c` is less than the sum of `b` for the subarray, it prints "NO".
     - If the subarray has only one element (`x == y`), it prints "NO" (because a single element cannot satisfy the condition `a_i != b_i`).
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Condition for "Good" Subarray:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the condition that `a_i != b_i` for every index `i` in the subarray. It only checks if the sum of `b` is greater than the sum of `c`, which is insufficient.
   - The program does not ensure that `b_i > 0` for every index `i` in the subarray. However, since `b[i]` is constructed to be at least 1 or 2, this condition is implicitly satisfied.

2. **Single Element Subarray:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the subarray has only one element by printing "NO".

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly check if the subarray is "good" based on the problem's criteria. It only checks if the sum of `b` is greater than the sum of `c` for the subarray, which is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is "good".
