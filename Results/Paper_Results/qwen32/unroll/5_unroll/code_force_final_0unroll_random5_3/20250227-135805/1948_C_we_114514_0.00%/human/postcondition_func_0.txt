The function `func_1` takes an integer `t` and a list of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` containing '<' and '>' characters. The function returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings indicating whether it is possible to reach the end of the second row starting from the beginning of the first row, following the rules defined by the characters in `row1` and `row2`.
