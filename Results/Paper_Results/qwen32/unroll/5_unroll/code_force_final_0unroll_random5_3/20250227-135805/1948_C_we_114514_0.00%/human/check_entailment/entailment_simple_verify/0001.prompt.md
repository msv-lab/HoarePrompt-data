You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by simulating the robot's possible movements on the grid. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. The code reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two rows of the grid.

2. For each test case, it initializes two boolean variables:
   - `reachable_first_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can initially be on the first row)
   - `reachable_second_row` to `False` (indicating the robot cannot initially be on the second row)

3. It then iterates through each column `j` of the grid:
   - If the robot can be on the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is in the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can move down and reach the target cell (2, n).
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
       - The robot cannot move left in the first column, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.
       - If the robot is not in the last column and the arrow in the second row points to the right (`j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

   - If the robot can be on the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is in the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot has reached the target cell (2, n).

4. After processing all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

However, there is a critical flaw in this logic. The code doesn't correctly simulate the robot's movement up and down between the rows. Specifically, it doesn't handle the case where the robot can move from the second row to the first row and vice versa. The robot can move up from the second row to the first row if the arrow in the second row points upwards (which is represented by the arrow pointing to the left in the first row and the arrow pointing to the right in the second row at the same column).

For example, consider the following test case:
```
4
>><<
>>><
```
The robot can move as follows:
- (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4)

However, the code will not recognize this path because it doesn't correctly handle the up and down movements between the rows.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.
