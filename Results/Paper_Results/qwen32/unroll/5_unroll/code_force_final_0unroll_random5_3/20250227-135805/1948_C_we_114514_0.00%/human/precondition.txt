t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, n is even), followed by two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
