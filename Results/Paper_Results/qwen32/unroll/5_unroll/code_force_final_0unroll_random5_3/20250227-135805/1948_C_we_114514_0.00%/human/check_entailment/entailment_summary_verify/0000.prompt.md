You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Example

    >><<><
    
    ><>>><

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:

        row2 = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, (row1, row2)))

                    if j == n - 1:

                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
        if reachable_second_row:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes an integer `t` and a list of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` containing '<' and '>' characters. The function returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings indicating whether it is possible to reach the end of the second row starting from the beginning of the first row, following the rules defined by the characters in `row1` and `row2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases for the robot's movement. Specifically, the logic for moving the robot and checking if it can reach the cell (2, n) is flawed. The code does not account for the robot's ability to move up or down after its initial move and then follow the arrow in the new cell. The code only considers moving right along the arrows in the first row and then moving right along the arrows in the second row, which is not sufficient to cover all possible paths the robot can take.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4
><<>
><<>
```
In this case, the robot can start at (1, 1), move left to (1, 0) (which is not possible, but let's consider the logical flow), then move right to (1, 1), then move down to (2, 1), then right to (2, 2), then up to (1, 2), then right to (1, 3), then down to (2, 3), then right to (2, 4). This path should result in "YES" because the robot can reach (2, 4). However, the given code will not recognize this path and will incorrectly output "NO".

The code needs to be modified to properly simulate the robot's movements according to the problem description, considering all possible moves (left, right, up, down) and following the arrows accordingly.
