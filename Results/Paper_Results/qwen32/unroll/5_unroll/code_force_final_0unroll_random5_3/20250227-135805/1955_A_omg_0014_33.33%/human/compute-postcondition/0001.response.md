The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `n`. The variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to influence whether the loop executes.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, only `n` does.

So, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴; `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 1; `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 30; `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 30**
