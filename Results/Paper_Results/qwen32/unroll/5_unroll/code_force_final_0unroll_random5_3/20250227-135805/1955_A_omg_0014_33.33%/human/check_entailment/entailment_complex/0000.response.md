Reasoning:  
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze the logic of the program and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, it incorrectly assigns these values to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The correct assignment should be `n`, `a`, and `b` because `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts on promotion.

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Cost**:
   - The program calculates `d = c / 2` which is incorrect in this context. The variable `c` does not exist in the correct context of the problem. Instead, it should be using `b` (the price for two yogurts on promotion).
   - The condition `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect. The correct logic to determine the minimum cost should involve calculating the cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then buying any remaining yogurt at the regular price.
   - The program incorrectly prints `a * b` or `round(a * d)`. The correct calculation should be based on the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price and the cost of any additional yogurt bought at the regular price.

3. **Correct Logic**:
   - Calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price: `pairs = n // 2`.
   - Calculate the cost for these pairs: `cost_pairs = pairs * b`.
   - Calculate how many yogurts are left to buy at the regular price: `remaining = n % 2`.
   - Calculate the cost for the remaining yogurts: `cost_remaining = remaining * a`.
   - The total minimum cost is `cost_pairs + cost_remaining`.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not follow the correct logic to calculate the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts.

Correctness: **False**
