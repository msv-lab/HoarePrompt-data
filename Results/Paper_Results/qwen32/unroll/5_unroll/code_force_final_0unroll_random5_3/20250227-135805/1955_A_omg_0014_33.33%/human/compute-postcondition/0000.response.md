The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user input. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, but since the code is reading a new value for `n`, this new value will replace the previous one. The other variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴; `n` is the integer value provided by the user input; `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 30; `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 30.**
