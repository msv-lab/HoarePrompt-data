To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to consider the given code and initial state:

- **Initial State:** `test_cases` holds the return value of `func_1()`. Let's denote this return value as `N`. Therefore, initially, `test_cases = N`.
- **Loop Code:** The loop runs `N` times, calling `func_6()` in each iteration.

Since the loop only involves calling `func_6()` and does not modify `test_cases` or any other variable outside the loop, the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged. The state of any other variables not mentioned in the loop is also unaffected.

**Output State:** `test_cases` still holds the return value of `func_1()`, which is `N`.

Output State: **test_cases holds the return value of `func_1()`.**
