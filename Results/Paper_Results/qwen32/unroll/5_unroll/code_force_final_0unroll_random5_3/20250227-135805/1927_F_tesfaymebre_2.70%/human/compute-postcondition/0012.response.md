The code snippet initializes a list named `colors` with `n + 1` elements, all set to `0`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `graph`, `edges`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `node_u`, or `node_v`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` remain the values returned by `func_3()`, `graph` is unchanged, `edges` is unchanged, `dsu` reflects the connected components, `_min_edge` is the smallest edge weight in any connected component, `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes of the edge with the smallest weight in the connected component, `colors` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
