Functionality: **The function `func_6` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph and `m` is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph. The constraints are that `3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5)`. The function returns a graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges.**
