### Reasoning:

The provided code is intended to solve the problem of finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph such that the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle is minimal. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the code:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of vertices (`n`), the number of edges (`m`), and the edges themselves (each edge is represented by two vertices and a weight).

2. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list (`graph`) and a list of edges (`edges`), where each edge is stored as a tuple containing the weight and the two vertices it connects.

3. **Edge Sorting**: The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weights. This is done to process the heaviest edges first, which might seem counterintuitive at first, but it is used later to find the cycle.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**: A DSU (also known as Union-Find) data structure is used to keep track of connected components in the graph. The DSU is initialized with `n+1` elements (to account for 1-based indexing).

5. **Cycle Detection**: The program iterates over the edges in descending order of weight. When it finds an edge that connects two vertices that are already in the same connected component (i.e., a cycle is detected), it updates the minimum edge weight found in that cycle and records the vertices involved.

6. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: After identifying an edge that completes a cycle, the program uses DFS to find the vertices that form the cycle. The DFS starts from one of the vertices involved in the cycle and backtracks to find the entire cycle.

7. **Output**: For each test case, the program outputs the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the list of vertices in the cycle.

### Issues:

- **DFS Function**: The DFS function (`dfs`) is defined but not properly integrated into the `func_6` function. The `graph` variable used in the DFS function is not defined in its scope. It should be passed as an argument to the DFS function.
  
- **Edge Sorting**: Sorting edges in descending order of weight and then processing them to find cycles is not the most efficient way to find the cycle with the smallest lightest edge. A more efficient approach would be to use Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and then add the next lightest edge to form a cycle.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues mentioned above, the provided code is not correct as it does not properly implement the required functionality to find the cycle with the smallest lightest edge. The DFS function is not correctly defined and the approach to finding the cycle is not optimal.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
