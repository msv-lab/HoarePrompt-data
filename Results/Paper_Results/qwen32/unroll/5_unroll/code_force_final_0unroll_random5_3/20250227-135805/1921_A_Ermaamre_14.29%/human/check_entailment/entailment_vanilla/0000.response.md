Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

The problem states that we need to find the area of a square given its four corners. The corners will have coordinates such that the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes. This means that two of the corners will have the same x-coordinate, and two other corners will have the same x-coordinate (and similarly for the y-coordinates).

The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners. The program then checks which pairs of x-coordinates are the same and calculates the side length of the square using the difference in the y-coordinates of the corresponding corners. The area of the square is then calculated as the square of the side length.

Let's break down the logic in the program:
- The program considers three possible scenarios for the x-coordinates of the corners:
  1. `x1 == x3 and x2 == x4`
  2. `x1 == x2 and x3 == x4`
  3. `x1 == x4 and x3 == x2`
- For each scenario, it calculates the side length of the square using the difference in the y-coordinates of the corresponding corners.
- Finally, it prints the area of the square, which is the square of the side length.

The logic in the program is correct, but there is a potential issue. The program only checks for the first scenario where `x1 == x3 and x2 == x4` and then calculates the side length using the y-coordinates of `(x1, y1)` and `(x3, y3)`. However, it does not handle the case where the y-coordinates might be in a different order, and similarly for the other scenarios.

However, the program does handle the different order of y-coordinates by using the absolute value function `abs()`. This ensures that the side length is always calculated correctly regardless of the order of the y-coordinates.

Let's verify the program with the provided example:
1. For the first test case, the corners are (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2). The program correctly identifies that `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, and calculates the side length as `abs(5 - 2) = 3`. The area is `3 ** 2 = 9`.
2. For the second test case, the corners are (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1). The program correctly identifies that `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, and calculates the side length as `abs(1 - (-1)) = 2`. The area is `2 ** 2 = 4`.
3. For the third test case, the corners are (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39). The program correctly identifies that `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, and calculates the side length as `abs(39 - 11) = 28`. The area is `28 ** 2 = 784`.

The program correctly handles all the provided test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
