Reasoning:
The given program is designed to calculate the area of a square given its four corner coordinates. The program correctly identifies pairs of x-coordinates that are equal, which indicates that these points share a vertical edge of the square. It then calculates the length of the side of the square by taking the absolute difference in the y-coordinates of these points. The same logic is applied to the other pairs of points to handle different possible orders of the input coordinates. The area of the square is then calculated by squaring the side length.

The program correctly handles all possible orders of the input coordinates, as it checks all combinations of pairs of points to find two points that share a vertical edge. Once it finds such a pair, it calculates the side length and then the area of the square. The annotated states in the comments indicate that the program is expected to print the area of each square for each test case, which the program does correctly.

The program also adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description, such as handling up to 100 test cases and coordinates ranging from -1000 to 1000.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct for the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
