Reasoning: The original assessment appears to be accurate. The program correctly identifies the side length of the square by comparing the coordinates of the corners and handles different orders of points. The logic for determining the side length and calculating the area is sound. The program considers all possible valid configurations of the square's corners and computes the area correctly. The function summary and the original assessment both align with the problem description and the provided code.

Final: **True**
