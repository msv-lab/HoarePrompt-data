### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `soma = 0`: This variable is intended to accumulate the sum of digit sums for each test case, but it is not reset between test cases. This means the results from one test case will carry over to the next, which is incorrect.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases:**
   - `for _ in range(N)`: This correctly iterates through each test case.
   - `n = int(input())`: This correctly reads the integer `n` for each test case.

3. **Sum of Digits Calculation:**
   - `for i in range(n)`: This loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`. However, the problem description requires summing the digits of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Therefore, the loop should be `for i in range(1, n+1)`.

4. **Digit Sum Function:**
   - `def func_1(n): return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))`: This function correctly calculates the sum of the digits of `n` as per the function summary.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints `soma` only once after processing all test cases. It should print the result for each test case separately.

### Correctness:
- The main issues are:
  - The loop should iterate from 1 to `n` inclusive, not from 0 to `n-1`.
  - The `soma` variable should be reset for each test case.
  - The program should print the result for each test case separately.

### Revised Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the original program, the original assessment was accurate. The program is incorrect due to the range of the loop and the handling of the `soma` variable across test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
