Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. The variable `soma` is used to accumulate the sum across all test cases, which is incorrect. The sum should be calculated for each test case separately and then printed for each test case.

2. The loop `for i in range(n):` starts from 0. However, the problem specifies that Vladislav writes the integers from 1 to `n`, inclusive. Therefore, the loop should start from 1.

3. The function `func_1` is defined after it is used in the code, which can cause a `NameError` in Python. The function should be defined before it is called.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

This corrected version initializes `soma` for each test case, starts the loop from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and defines `func_1` before it is used.
