### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if the scores at the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are both the maximum score in the array `a`. If so, it prints "Draw".
   - If Bodya's starting position has the maximum score, it prints "Bodya".
   - If Sasha's starting position has the maximum score, it prints "Sasha".

3. **Simulation of the Game:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - It keeps track of the scores for Bodya and Sasha in lists `b` and `s`.
   - If either player reaches the maximum score in `a`, they continue to collect that score for the remaining turns.
   - It updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p` if they do not collect the maximum score.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative scores for Bodya and Sasha in `preb` and `pres`.
   - It calculates the potential total scores for Bodya and Sasha if they continue to collect their current scores for the remaining turns in `ptsb` and `ptss`.
   - It determines the maximum possible score for Bodya and Sasha from `ptsb` and `ptss`.
   - It compares the maximum scores and prints the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness of the Logic:**
  - The initial checks for the maximum score at the starting positions are correct.
  - The simulation of the game for `k` turns and the calculation of potential scores are correct.
  - The final comparison of the maximum scores is correct.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where both players have the maximum score at their starting positions.
  - It handles the case where one player has the maximum score at their starting position.
  - It handles the case where neither player has the maximum score at their starting position and simulates the game for `k` turns.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: **True**
