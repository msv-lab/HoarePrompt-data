The provided code snippet only initializes a constant `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `YES`, `NO`) are modified by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `MOD` has been set to `1000000007`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases: n, k, P_B, and P_S are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n. a is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO'. `MOD` is 1000000007.**
