The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't intend to use. However, the loop will execute based on the range provided by `int(input())`, which is `t` in this case.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is at least 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, `alpha`) are not directly part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted to make the loop execute. They will be initialized and used within the loop body, but their states are not relevant to the loop's execution itself.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
