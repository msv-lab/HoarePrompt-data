Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in handling the game dynamics and the scoring mechanism. Specifically, the program does not correctly simulate the game for all possible scenarios, particularly when the players can enter cycles or loops within the permutation.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Cycle Handling**: The code does not correctly handle the scenario where players enter cycles within the permutation. For example, if `p_x = x`, the player will stay in the same position indefinitely. The code does not account for this correctly and may not compute the scores accurately for such cases.
   
2. **Scoring Calculation**: The scoring calculation is based on the assumption that players will always move to the next position in the permutation until they find the maximum score, which is not always the optimal strategy. Players might choose to stay in the same position if it yields a higher score compared to moving to the next position.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases where `k` is very large, and players might stay in the same position for multiple turns. The logic for handling such cases is not robust.

#### Example of a Failing Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 1000000000 1 2
3 1 2
1 2 3
```
In this case, Bodya starts at position 1 and Sasha starts at position 2. The permutation is `[3, 1, 2]`, and the scores are `[1, 2, 3]`. 

- Bodya's path: `1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> ...` (cycle)
- Sasha's path: `2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> ...` (cycle)

The optimal strategy for both players is to stay in the position with the highest score, which is position 3. However, the code does not correctly simulate this scenario and might incorrectly compute the scores.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all possible scenarios, particularly those involving cycles and optimal strategies for staying in positions with the highest scores. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
