The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
