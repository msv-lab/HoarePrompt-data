### Reasoning:
To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the optimal strategy for both players. The key insight is that the game can be reduced to a simple parity check on the sum of the coins in both wallets.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Game Dynamics Analysis:**
   - Each player can either swap wallets or not swap wallets.
   - After each turn, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force a win by ensuring she is the one to make the last move.
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, the second player (Bob) can always force a win by mirroring Alice's moves.

3. **Parity Check:**
   - The sum of the coins (`a + b`) determines the winner:
     - If `a + b` is even, Bob wins because he can mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he is the one to make the last move.
     - If `a + b` is odd, Alice wins because she can force Bob into a position where he is the one who cannot make a move.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of `a + b` and printing 'Bob' if the sum is even and 'Alice' if the sum is odd.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct as it accurately determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins in both wallets.
