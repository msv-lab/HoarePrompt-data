### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the key insight that the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum of coins `(a + b)` determines the winner of the game. The logic provided in the program aligns with this insight:

- If the sum of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob wins.
- If the sum of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice wins.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, computes the sum, checks its parity, and prints the correct winner based on the derived strategy.

The annotations also correctly state that the output for each test case is either 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the parity of `a + b`, which matches the game's optimal play scenario.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
