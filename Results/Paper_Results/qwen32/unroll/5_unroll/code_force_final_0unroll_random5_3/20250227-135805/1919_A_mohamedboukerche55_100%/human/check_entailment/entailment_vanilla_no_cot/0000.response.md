To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic behind the solution and see if it aligns with the problem description and the provided examples.

The problem revolves around a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing a coin until one of them cannot make a move. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins.

When both players play optimally, the player who starts the game (Alice) will win if the total number of coins (a + b) is odd. This is because the first player can always force the game into a position where the second player is left with an even number of coins, ultimately leading to a win for the first player.

Conversely, if the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will win because Alice, starting the game, will eventually be left with an odd number of coins, leading to a win for Bob.

Let's check the provided program against this logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

The program correctly identifies the parity of the total number of coins (a + b) and assigns the winner based on whether the total is even or odd. This matches the optimal strategy described above.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Your response:
Correctness: **True**
