Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem of generating an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. However, there are several issues in the code that make it incorrect:

1. **Function Call Before Definition**: The function `func_1` is called before it is defined in the code. This will result in a `NameError` at runtime.

2. **Incorrect Base Case Handling**: The base case in `func_1` returns a tuple `(0, 0)` when `number == 0`. However, the function is supposed to modify the `sequence` list, and returning a tuple does not achieve this. The base case should be handled by simply returning without modifying the sequence further.

3. **Logic Errors in Sequence Generation**: The logic for generating the sequence based on the number of increasing subsequences is incorrect. The code attempts to use bit manipulation to determine the size and overlap of the sequence, but this approach is flawed and does not guarantee that the generated sequence will have exactly X increasing subsequences.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as when X is very large or when there is no possible sequence that can have exactly X increasing subsequences.

5. **Output Format**: The code does not correctly handle the case where it is impossible to find the required array. Instead of printing `-1`, it attempts to generate a sequence, which may not be possible.

To fix the program, the logic for generating the sequence would need to be corrected, and the function should be defined before it is called. Additionally, the program should correctly handle the case where it is impossible to find the required array and print `-1` in such cases.
