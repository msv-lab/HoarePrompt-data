Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence that results in exactly `X` increasing subsequences, but the implementation seems to have issues. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Function Signature and Return Values**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to modify the `sequence` list in place and return nothing (`None`), but it has a return statement that returns a tuple `(0, 0)` when `number == 0`. This return value is not used anywhere, and it can be removed.

2. **Logic for Generating the Sequence**:
   - The logic for generating the sequence seems complex and not straightforward. The use of bitwise operations and the recursive calls might not be generating the correct sequence for all values of `X`.
   - The assertion `assert number >= 0` is fine, but it does not handle the case where `number` could be zero, which should be a valid input scenario.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `X` is a power of 2 correctly. For example, if `X = 2`, the expected output is an array of length 1, but the program might not generate this correctly.
   - The program might not handle very large values of `X` correctly, as the logic seems to rely on a specific pattern that might not scale well.

4. **Testing Specific Cases**:
   - Let's test the program with `X = 2`. The expected output is `1\n0`, but the program might not generate this correctly.
   - Testing with `X = 5` should produce an array with exactly 5 increasing subsequences, but the provided output `3\n0 1 0` does not seem to meet this requirement.

Given these points, the program does not appear to be correct for all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
