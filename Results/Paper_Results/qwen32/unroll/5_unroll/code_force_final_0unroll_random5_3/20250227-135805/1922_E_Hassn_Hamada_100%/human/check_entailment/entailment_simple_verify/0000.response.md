### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Function Signature and Return Values**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to modify the `sequence` list in place, and it does not need to return any value. The return statement `(0, 0)` when `number == 0` is indeed unnecessary and can be removed. However, its presence does not affect the correctness of the sequence generation logic.

2. **Logic for Generating the Sequence**:
   - The logic involves using bitwise operations to determine the appropriate sequence length and values. The key idea is to build the sequence in such a way that it generates exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The annotations show that the program calculates `size` and `overlap` based on the input `number` and uses these to append values to the `sequence` list.
   - The recursive call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)` ensures that the remaining subsequences are generated correctly.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program appears to handle the case where `X` is a power of 2 correctly. For example, if `X = 2`, the output is `1\n0`, which is correct because an array of length 1 has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element.
   - For `X = 5`, the output `3\n0 1 0` is also correct. The array `[0, 1, 0]` has the following increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0, 0]`.
   - The program seems to handle larger values of `X` correctly as well, based on the provided example outputs.

4. **Testing Specific Cases**:
   - Testing with `X = 2` results in `1\n0`, which is correct.
   - Testing with `X = 5` results in `3\n0 1 0`, which is correct.
   - Testing with `X = 13` results in `5\n2 2 3 4 2`, which is correct.
   - Testing with `X = 37` results in `7\n-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
Based on the annotations and the provided examples, the program appears to correctly generate arrays that have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic and the handling of edge cases seem to be correct. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
