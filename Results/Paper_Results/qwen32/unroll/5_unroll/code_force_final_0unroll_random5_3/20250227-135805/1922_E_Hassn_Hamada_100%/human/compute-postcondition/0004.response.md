The given code snippet assigns the value `(0, 0)` to the variable `size_overlap`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case. Additionally, `number` is not equal to 0; `size_overlap` is (0, 0).**
