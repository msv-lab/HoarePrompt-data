State right before the while loop: `num_tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000.
```
while num_tests > 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

Now, let's analyze the condition for the loop to execute the first time. The loop will execute if `num_tests` is greater than 0. Given the range 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` is already guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to ensure that the loop can execute.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000**
