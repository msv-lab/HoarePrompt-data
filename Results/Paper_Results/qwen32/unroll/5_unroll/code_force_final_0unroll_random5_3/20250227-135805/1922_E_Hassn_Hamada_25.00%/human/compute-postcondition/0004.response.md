The code snippet provided simply assigns the value `1` to the variable `size`. None of the other variables (`number` and `sequence`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`number` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case, `size` is 1.**
