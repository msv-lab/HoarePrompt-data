The function `func_1` reads an integer `t`, then for each of the next `t` instances, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s`. It counts the number of '1's in the string `s` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions related to the count of '1's and the presence of '11' in the string. The function does not return any value; it only prints output.
