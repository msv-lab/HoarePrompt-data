Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the given function summary to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

### Problem Analysis Recap
Bob aims to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns under a promotional pricing strategy:
- Up to `k` buns can be sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` coins down to `(b - k + 1)` coins.
- The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.
- The goal is to determine the optimal `k` to maximize profit.

### Key Steps to Maximize Profit Recap
1. **Determine `k`:** The optimal `k` is the number of buns sold at promotional prices, constrained by `k <= min(n, b - a)`.
2. **Calculate Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - Otherwise, calculate the profit from the first `k` buns using the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `(b - k + 1)`, and add the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at `a`.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the program step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Determining `k`:**
   - The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This ensures `k` does not exceed the number of buns or the difference between `b` and `a`.

3. **Calculating Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, the program outputs `a * n`, meaning all buns are sold at the usual price.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit from the first `k` buns using the arithmetic series sum formula and adds the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at `a`.

### Detailed Reasoning
Let's verify the implementation of the arithmetic series sum:
- The sum of the series from `b` to `(b - k + 1)` is calculated as:
  \[
  S = \frac{(b + (b - k + 1)) * k}{2}
  \]
  This formula correctly computes the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series.
- The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`.

### Function Summary Validation
The function summary accurately describes the logic:
- It processes `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it computes and prints a result based on `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- It correctly handles the case where `b <= a` by printing `a * n`.
- It correctly calculates the profit for the promotional pricing strategy when `b > a`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the promotional pricing strategy. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
