Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program is incorrect because it only considers forming polygons with 3 sides (triangles) by dividing the count of each stick length by 3. However, the problem description allows for forming any regular polygon with equal-sided sides, not just triangles. 

For example, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
We can form a regular hexagon (6-sided polygon) using all 6 sticks of length 2.

However, the given program will output `2` because it divides the count of sticks of length 2 by 3, resulting in `2` triangles, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program is not handling the general case of forming polygons with more than 3 sides, making it incorrect.
