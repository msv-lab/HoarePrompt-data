To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the context and the calculations involved based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- **t**: The number of test cases.
- **n**: The number of sticks available for the current test case.
- **a**: A list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks for the current test case.
- **ans**: The total number of complete sets of three sticks that can be formed from the sticks of each unique length.
- **cnt**: A dictionary where each key is a unique stick length from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that stick length appears in `a`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
The variable `ans` is described as the total number of complete sets of three sticks that can be formed from the sticks of each unique length. This implies that for each unique stick length, we can form sets of three sticks if there are at least three sticks of that length. The number of such sets for a given stick length can be calculated by integer division of the count of that stick length by 3.

### Example Calculation:
Let's say the list `a` contains the following stick lengths: `[3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`.
- The dictionary `cnt` would be `{3: 3, 5: 6}`.
- For stick length `3`, we can form `3 // 3 = 1` set of three sticks.
- For stick length `5`, we can form `6 // 3 = 2` sets of three sticks.
- Therefore, `ans` would be `1 + 2 = 3`.

### General Case:
For each unique stick length in `cnt`, the number of sets of three sticks that can be formed is `cnt[length] // 3`. The total number of such sets across all unique stick lengths is the sum of these values.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the total number of complete sets of three sticks that can be formed from the sticks of each unique length.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of complete sets of three sticks that can be formed from the sticks of each unique length)**
