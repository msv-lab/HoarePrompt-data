You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())

            max_val = y

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `x` where `2 <= x <= 1000` and returns the largest proper divisor of `x` that is less than `x/2`. If `x` is a prime number, it returns `1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not always find the optimal \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

Let's analyze the code and a potential edge case:

The code iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2, checking if \( x \% y == 0 \) (i.e., \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \)). If \( 2 * y \geq x \), it immediately returns \( y \). Otherwise, it updates `max_val` to \( y \) and continues. This approach does not guarantee that the returned \( y \) maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

Consider the following counterexample:

For \( x = 12 \):
- The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.
- The code will check 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6.
- When it checks \( y = 6 \), \( x \% y == 0 \) and \( 2 * 6 \geq 12 \), so it returns \( y = 6 \).
- However, \( \gcd(12, 6) + 6 = 6 + 6 = 12 \).

But let's check \( y = 8 \):
- \( \gcd(12, 8) = 4 \).
- \( \gcd(12, 8) + 8 = 4 + 8 = 12 \).

In this case, \( y = 6 \) and \( y = 8 \) both yield the same maximum value, but the code does not guarantee that it will find the maximum possible value for all cases.

However, let's consider another example where the code might fail to find the optimal \( y \):

For \( x = 15 \):
- The divisors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, 15.
- The code will check 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5.
- When it checks \( y = 5 \), \( x \% y == 0 \) and \( 2 * 5 < 15 \), so it updates `max_val` to 5.
- It continues checking and finds no other divisor that meets the condition \( 2 * y \geq x \).
- Finally, it returns \( y = 5 \).

But let's check \( y = 14 \):
- \( \gcd(15, 14) = 1 \).
- \( \gcd(15, 14) + 14 = 1 + 14 = 15 \).

In this case, \( y = 14 \) yields a higher value than \( y = 5 \), so the code is incorrect for this input.

Therefore, the code does not always find the optimal \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \), and the correctness is **False**.
