To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the given code step by step:

The loop iterates over `y` from `x - 1` down to `2` (inclusive). For each `y`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`). If `x` is divisible by `y` and `2 * y >= x`, the function immediately returns `y`. If `2 * y < x`, it updates `max_val` to `y` and continues the loop. If no such `y` is found that satisfies `2 * y >= x`, the loop completes, and `max_val` holds the largest proper divisor of `x` that is less than `x/2`.

Given the initial state that `x` is an integer such that `2 <= x <= 1000` and `max_val` is initialized to `1`, we need to consider the possible outcomes of the loop:

1. If `x` is a prime number, the loop will not find any `y` such that `x % y == 0` (except for `y = 1` which is not in the loop range), and `max_val` will remain `1`.
2. If `x` is not a prime number, the loop will find the largest proper divisor of `x` that is less than `x/2` and assign it to `max_val`.

Since the problem does not specify a particular value for `x`, we can describe the output state in a general form.

Output State: **`max_val` is the largest proper divisor of `x` that is less than `x/2`, or `1` if `x` is a prime number.**
