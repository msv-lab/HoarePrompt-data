Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. Each integer `p_i` in the list `p` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` is not equal to `i` for all `i` in [1, n]. The function returns the number of swaps needed to sort the list `p` into ascending order using the minimum number of swaps, where each swap involves swapping two elements in the list.**
