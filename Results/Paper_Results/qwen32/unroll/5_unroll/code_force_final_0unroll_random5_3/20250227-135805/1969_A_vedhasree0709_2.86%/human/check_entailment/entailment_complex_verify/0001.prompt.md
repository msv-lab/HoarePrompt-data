You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; p is a list of n distinct integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n for all i in [1, n] and p_i != i for all i in [1, n].

            print(3)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output will be either `2` or `3`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists a pair of consecutive elements in the list that can be swapped to move towards sorting the list in ascending order with a specific pattern. If such a pair is found, it outputs `2`; otherwise, it outputs `3`. The function does not return a value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Monocarp wants at least 2 friends at his party.
2. Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i` and will only come to the party if both `i` and `p_i` receive invitations.
3. The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program iterates over test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `l`. It then checks if there are two consecutive friends `i` and `i+1` such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` (indicating that inviting these two friends is enough). If no such pair is found, it defaults to printing `3`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic Error**: The program only checks for a very specific pattern (`l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`) to determine if 2 invitations are enough. This condition is not sufficient to guarantee that two friends will attend the party.
2. **Incorrect Handling of General Cases**: The program does not correctly handle all possible configurations of best friends. For example, in the second test case (`p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`), the program would incorrectly print `3` instead of `3`, which is actually the correct answer but not derived from the logic used.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not account for cases where more than 3 invitations might be necessary or where a different configuration of invitations can result in exactly 2 friends attending the party with fewer than 3 invitations.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify pairs of friends `(i, p_i)` where both friends can attend the party if both are invited.
2. Use a graph-based approach where each friend is a node and each best friendship is a directed edge.
3. Find the minimum number of nodes to cover such that at least two nodes in each covered pair are included.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues outlined above, the provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations required in all cases.

**Correctness: False**
