The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `s` as they are not modified by the code. The only change is the introduction of the `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `s` for each test case remain unchanged; `results` is an empty list.**
