Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of coins and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters "U" and "D" representing the state of each coin (facing up or facing down). For each test case, the function returns the number of pairs of adjacent coins that are in the same state (both "U" or both "D").**
