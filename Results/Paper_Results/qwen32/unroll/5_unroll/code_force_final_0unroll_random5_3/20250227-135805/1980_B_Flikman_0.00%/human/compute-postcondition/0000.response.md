The code snippet provided is:
```python
t = int(input())
```
This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` was already an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). After executing the code, the value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)**.
