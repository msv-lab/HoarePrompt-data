Let's analyze the original assessment and the annotated code to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nikita can perform two types of operations on a tower of cubes: adding one cube or removing one cube. We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Points:
1. **Adding and Removing Cubes**: Each move can either add or remove one cube.
2. **Parity of Moves**: To end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because each pair of operations (add then remove or remove then add) leaves the number of cubes unchanged, and any remaining operations must either all add or all remove cubes, which requires an even number of such operations.
3. **Number of Moves Constraint**: If `n < m`, it is impossible to end up with `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n`.

### Program Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Annotated Code:
The annotations correctly describe the program's behavior. For each test case, the program checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `n < m`. However, the program already implicitly handles this case by printing "NO" when `n < m` because the condition `n >= m` will not be satisfied.

### Evaluation:
- **Case `n >= m`**: The program correctly checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` to determine if it's possible to reach `m` cubes.
- **Case `n < m`**: The program correctly prints "NO" because `n >= m` will be false.

Thus, the original assessment is incorrect. The program already correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
