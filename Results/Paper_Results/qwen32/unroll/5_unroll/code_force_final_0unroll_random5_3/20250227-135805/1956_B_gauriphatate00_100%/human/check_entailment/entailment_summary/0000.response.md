### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. Each player receives `n` cards, and the cards are numbered from 1 to `n` such that each number appears exactly twice in the deck.

The provided program counts the number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly twice in the list of cards you have. This count is the maximum number of points you can score because:

- If a number appears exactly twice in your hand, you can place one of the cards on the table, and on your next turn, there will already be a card with that number on the table, earning you a point.
- If a number appears only once in your hand, you cannot score a point with it because there will be no matching card for it on the table when you place it.
- If a number appears more than twice in your hand, it is not possible given the problem constraints (each number appears exactly twice in the deck).

The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic by counting the numbers that appear exactly twice in the list `a`. The execution summary confirms that the function returns the count of such numbers, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness: **True**
