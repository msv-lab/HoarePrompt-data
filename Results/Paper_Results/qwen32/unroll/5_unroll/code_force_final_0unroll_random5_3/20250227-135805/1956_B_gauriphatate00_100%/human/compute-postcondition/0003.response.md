The code snippet provided initializes a variable `max_score` to 0. This does not affect the values of `a`, `n`, or `count_a`. The only change is the introduction of `max_score` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and each value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`, `max_score` is 0.**
