Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program simply counts the number of cards you have that appear exactly twice and returns that count as your maximum score. However, the problem requires you to play optimally given that Nene is also playing optimally.

The key aspects to consider are:
1. You need to maximize your points.
2. Nene will play to maximize her points and minimize your points.
3. The optimal strategy involves considering which cards to play based on the current state of the table and the remaining cards in both players' hands.

The provided solution does not account for these strategic considerations. It only counts pairs in your hand without considering the sequence of plays and the impact of Nene's optimal play. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.
