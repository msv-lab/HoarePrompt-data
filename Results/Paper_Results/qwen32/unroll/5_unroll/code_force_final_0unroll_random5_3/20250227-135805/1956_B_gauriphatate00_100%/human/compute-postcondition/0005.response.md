To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the given code and how it modifies the variables.

The loop iterates over each integer from 1 to `n`. For each integer `num`, it checks if `num` exists in the dictionary `count_a`. If `num` exists and its count in `count_a` is exactly 2, it increments `max_score` by 1.

Here's the breakdown:

1. `a` remains unchanged since it is not modified in the loop.
2. `count_a` remains unchanged since it is only read from, not written to.
3. `max_score` is incremented by 1 for each integer `num` in the range from 1 to `n` that appears exactly twice in the list `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and each value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`, `max_score` is the number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly twice in `a`.**
