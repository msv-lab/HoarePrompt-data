### Reasoning:

Let's carefully evaluate the logic and correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and annotations.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to distribute `n` bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
- If such a distribution exists, output the bets; otherwise, output `-1`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Calculating the Product:**
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers: `prod = k_1 * k_2 * ... * k_n`.

3. **Calculating `vprod`:**
   - For each multiplier `k_i`, it calculates `vprod[i] = prod // k_i`, which is the product of all multipliers except `k_i`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - It calculates `den = prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den <= 0`, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to distribute the coins as required.

5. **Printing the Result:**
   - If `den > 0`, it prints the values in `vprod`.

#### Verification of Logic:
- The key idea is to distribute the coins such that the total bet (`sum(vprod)`) is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome (`k_i * vprod[i] = prod`).
- The condition `prod - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that `sum(vprod) < prod`, which is necessary for the distribution to be valid.

#### Edge Cases:
- **All `k_i` are equal:** In this case, `prod - sum(vprod)` will be `0`, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.
- **`k_i` values vary:** The program ensures that the distribution is feasible by checking if `prod - sum(vprod) > 0`.

#### Annotations and State:
- Annotations indicate that `prod` is the product of all `k_i`.
- `vprod` is correctly calculated as `prod // k_i` for each `k_i`.
- `den` is correctly calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
- The program correctly checks if `den > 0` and prints `vprod` if true, otherwise `-1`.

#### Conclusion:
The annotations and the logic of the program align with the problem requirements. The program correctly handles the edge cases and ensures that the distribution of coins meets the problem's constraints.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the distribution of coins and checks the feasibility of the distribution based on the given multipliers.
Final: **True**
