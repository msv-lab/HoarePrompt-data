Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program calculates a product of all multipliers and then uses the product to determine the bets. This approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

To illustrate, let's consider a test case:

Input:
```
1
3
2 2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
1 1 1
```
Explanation: Betting 1 coin on each outcome results in a total of 3 coins bet. If any outcome wins, you receive back 2 coins, which is not greater than 3. Therefore, the program should output `-1` for this case.

However, the provided program will output:
```
2 2 2
```
This is because the product of the multipliers is 8, and the bets are calculated as `[4, 4, 4]` (since `8 // 2 = 4` for each multiplier). The total bet is 12, and for any winning outcome, you receive back 8 coins, which is not greater than 12. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
