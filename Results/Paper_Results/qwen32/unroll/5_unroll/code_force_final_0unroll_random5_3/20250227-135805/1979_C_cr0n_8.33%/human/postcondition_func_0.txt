The function reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `vals` from the input, calculates the product of all elements in `vals`, then computes a new list `vprod` where each element is the product divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. It then calculates `den` as the product minus the sum of `vprod`. If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string. The function does not accept any parameters and always returns `None`.
