### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if it adheres to the problem requirements and correctly computes the required output.

The problem requires us to distribute the bets in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the coins received back for each possible winning outcome. More formally, for each outcome \( i \), the sum of all bets \( \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j \) must be strictly less than \( k_i \times x_i \).

The program takes the following approach:
1. It calculates the product of all multipliers \( k_i \).
2. It then computes a new list `vprod` where each element is the product divided by the corresponding multiplier \( k_i \).
3. It calculates `den` as the product minus the sum of `vprod`.
4. If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution exists.
5. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod`.

Let's analyze the logic:

- The product of all multipliers \( k_i \) ensures that the resulting bets are scaled appropriately.
- The list `vprod` represents a potential distribution of bets where each bet \( x_i \) is calculated as \( \frac{\text{product}}{k_i} \).
- The sum of all bets is \( \sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{\text{product}}{k_j} \).
- The condition to check is \( \sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{\text{product}}{k_j} < k_i \times \frac{\text{product}}{k_i} \) for all \( i \). This simplifies to \( \sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{\text{product}}{k_j} < \text{product} \).
- This further simplifies to \( \text{product} - \sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{\text{product}}{k_j} > 0 \), which is exactly what the program checks with `den`.

Thus, the program correctly checks the condition and provides a valid distribution of bets if possible.
