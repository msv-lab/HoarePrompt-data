The code initializes a list named `values` with a length of `inf` (which is 200001) and assigns 0 to each element in the list. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as it is only mentioned as input and not modified by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases; `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros.**
