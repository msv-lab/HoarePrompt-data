To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to analyze the provided loop and its effect on the `values` list. The loop iterates from 1 to `inf` (which is set to 200001), and for each iteration `i`, it calculates the sum of the digits of `i` and adds this sum to the previous value in the `values` list.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is the number of test cases (not directly affecting the loop but given as part of the input).
   - `inf` is set to 200001, which is the upper limit of the loop.
   - `values` is a list of 200001 zeros.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration `i` from 1 to 200000 (since the range is `range(1, inf)` and `inf` is 200001):
     - `sum_value_digits` is initialized to 0.
     - For each digit `x` in the string representation of `i`, `sum_value_digits` is incremented by the integer value of `x`.
     - `values[i]` is updated to be `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`.

3. **Effect on `values` List**:
   - `values[0]` remains 0 as it is never updated.
   - `values[1]` will be the sum of the digits of 1, which is 1.
   - `values[2]` will be `values[1]` (which is 1) plus the sum of the digits of 2, which is 2, so `values[2]` becomes 3.
   - This process continues, and each `values[i]` is the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to `i`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, the `values` list will be updated such that each index `i` from 1 to 200000 will hold the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to `i`.

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases; `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list where `values[0]` is 0 and `values[i]` for i from 1 to 200000 is the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to i.**
