### Reasoning:
The provided program is designed to solve the problem by precomputing the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to \(2 \times 10^5\). This precomputation is done once and stored in the `values` array. For each test case, the program simply looks up the precomputed cumulative sum corresponding to the given `n` and prints it.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes an array `values` of size \(2 \times 10^5 + 1\) to store the cumulative sums of the digit sums. The array is initialized to zero.

2. **Precomputation**: The program iterates through all numbers from 1 to \(2 \times 10^5\). For each number `i`:
   - It calculates the sum of the digits of `i`.
   - It updates the `values` array at index `i` to be the sum of the cumulative sum at index `i-1` and the sum of the digits of `i`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints `values[n]`, which is the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Execution Summary Analysis:
The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program: it reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the precomputed cumulative sum of the digit sums up to `n`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It efficiently precomputes the required values and uses them to answer each test case in constant time, which is suitable given the constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
