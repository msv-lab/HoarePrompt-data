Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Requirements:
- **Stair**: The digits satisfy the condition \( a < b < c \).
- **Peak**: The digits satisfy the condition \( a < b > c \).
- **Neither**: If neither of the above conditions is met.

### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Stair**: The program correctly checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if true.
   - **Peak**: The program checks if `max(a, b, c) == b`. This condition is true if `b` is the largest of the three numbers, which can mean that `a < b > c` (peak) or `a == b > c` or `a < b == c`. However, the program does not explicitly check if `a < b > c` (peak), so this condition is not sufficient to identify a peak. It might incorrectly classify cases where `b` is the largest but `a` is not strictly less than `b` or `b` is not strictly greater than `c`.
   - **Neither**: The program checks other cases and prints "NONE". However, the condition `a == b == c` is redundant because if `a == b == c`, the condition `max(a, b, c) == b` will also be true, leading to incorrect classification as "PEAK" instead of "NONE".

### Issues Identified:
- The condition for a peak (`max(a, b, c) == b`) is too broad and can incorrectly classify cases.
- The condition `a == b == c` is redundant and can lead to incorrect classification due to the broader peak condition.

### Correct Approach:
- **Stair**: Check `a < b < c`.
- **Peak**: Check `a < b > c`.
- **Neither**: If neither of the above conditions is met.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the broad and incorrect condition for identifying a peak and the redundant condition for checking if all digits are equal.

Correctness: **False**
