Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `a == b` or `b == c` correctly. Specifically, the condition `elif a == b == c:` is unnecessary and does not cover all cases where the input does not form a "STAIR" or "PEAK". Additionally, the condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b:` is not sufficient to determine a "PEAK" because it does not ensure that `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. Instead, it should be `elif a < b > c:` to correctly identify a peak.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This version correctly identifies when the digits form a "STAIR" or a "PEAK" and outputs "NONE" for all other cases.
