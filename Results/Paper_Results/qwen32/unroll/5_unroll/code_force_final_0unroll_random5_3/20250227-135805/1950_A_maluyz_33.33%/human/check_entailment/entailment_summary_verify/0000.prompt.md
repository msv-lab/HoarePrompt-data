You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum of the three integers, and 'NONE' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly handles cases where two of the digits are the same but not all three. Specifically, the condition `elif a == b == c:` is unnecessary and incorrectly excludes valid "STAIR" or "PEAK" cases where two digits are equal but not all three. For example, the input `1 1 2` should output "STAIR" because `1 < 1 < 2` is not true, but `1 == 1 < 2` is a valid "STAIR" condition. Similarly, `2 2 1` should output "PEAK" because `2 == 2 > 1` is a valid "PEAK" condition. The condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b:` is also not sufficient to correctly identify "PEAK" cases, as it does not ensure that `a < b > c`.

Here are some test cases that demonstrate the issue:
- Input: `1 1 2`  
  Expected Output: `STAIR`  
  Actual Output: `NONE`
- Input: `2 2 1`  
  Expected Output: `PEAK`  
  Actual Output: `NONE`
- Input: `1 2 2`  
  Expected Output: `STAIR`  
  Actual Output: `NONE`
- Input: `2 1 1`  
  Expected Output: `PEAK`  
  Actual Output: `NONE`

These cases show that the program does not handle all potential inputs as specified in the problem description.
