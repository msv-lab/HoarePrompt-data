Output State: **After all iterations, `index` will be `1 + 2 * t + sum(n_i)`, where `n_i` is the value of `n` in the `i-th` iteration. `results` will contain `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1(array)` for the respective `array` in each iteration. `array` will hold the last `array` that was processed in the loop. `t` and `data` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The loop provided (`for result in results: print(result)`) will print each element in the `results` list, but this does not change the state of the variables.**
