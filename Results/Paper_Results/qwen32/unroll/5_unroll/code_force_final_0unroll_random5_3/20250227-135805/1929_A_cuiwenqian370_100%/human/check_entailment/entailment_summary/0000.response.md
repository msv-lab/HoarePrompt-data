### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify if the program meets the problem description by analyzing the behavior of both functions.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Code**: 
     ```python
     def func_1(array):
         array.sort()
         beauty = 0
         for i in range(1, len(array)):
             beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
         return beauty
     ```
   - **Behavior**: This function sorts the input array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - **Correctness**: Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. Given the problem, the beauty is the sum of differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. Sorting the array in ascending order makes the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) non-negative and maximizes the sum. Therefore, `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum beauty.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     def func_2():
         import sys
         input = sys.stdin.read
         data = input().split()
         t = int(data[0])
         index = 1
         results = []
         for _ in range(t):
             n = int(data[index])
             index += 1
             array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
             index += n
             result = func_1(array)
             results.append(result)
         for result in results:
             print(result)
     ```
   - **Behavior**: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
   - **Correctness**: The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. It correctly identifies the length of each array and the corresponding elements. It then calls `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty for each test case and stores the results. Finally, it prints the results, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Since `func_1` correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array and `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and utilizes `func_1` to produce the desired output, the program as a whole meets the problem description.

### Correctness: **True**
