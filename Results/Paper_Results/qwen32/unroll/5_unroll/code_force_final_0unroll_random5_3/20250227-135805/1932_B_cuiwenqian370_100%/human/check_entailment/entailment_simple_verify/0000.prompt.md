You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

    #State: - `input` remains unchanged.
    #   - `data` remains unchanged.
    #   - `index` is incremented by `1 + n` for each test case, so after all iterations, `index` will be `1 + sum(n_i)` where `n_i` is the number of elements in each test case.
    #   - `T` remains unchanged.
    #   - `results` will contain the final `last_year` values for each test case, each converted to a string.
    #
    #Given the initial state and the loop's behavior, the output state can be described as follows:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen according to the problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program and why it works:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` to the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign**:
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
   - This formula ensures that the next sign occurs after the last year and at a multiple of its periodicity.
   - It updates `last_year` to this new year.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, such as:
- When all signs have the same periodicity.
- When the periodicities are different and vary widely.
- When the number of signs `n` is 1, which means only one sign needs to be considered.

The example inputs provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the program, and no potential edge cases or incorrect scenarios were identified. Therefore, the program is correct.
