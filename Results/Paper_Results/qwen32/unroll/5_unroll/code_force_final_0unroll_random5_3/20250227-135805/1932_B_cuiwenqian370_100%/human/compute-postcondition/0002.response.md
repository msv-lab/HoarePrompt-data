The given code snippet only initializes the variable `index` to 0. No other variables are modified or used in this snippet. Therefore, the only change in the state is the introduction of the `index` variable with a value of 0.

Output State: **`input` is a string containing the entire input; `data` is a list where `data[0]` is the string representation of `n` and `data[1:]` are the string representations of `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`; `index` is 0.**
