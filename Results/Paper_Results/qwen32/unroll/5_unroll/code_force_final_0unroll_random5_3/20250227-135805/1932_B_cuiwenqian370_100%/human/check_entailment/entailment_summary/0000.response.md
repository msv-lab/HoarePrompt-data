### Reasoning:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen, based on the given periodicities. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the entire input at once, splits it into a list of strings (`data`), and processes it accordingly. It first reads the number of test cases (`T`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`).
   - It then reads the list of periodicities (`a`) for those `n` signs.
   
3. **Calculating the Last Year**:
   - It initializes `last_year` to the periodicity of the first sign (`a[0]`).
   - For each subsequent sign (from the second to the n-th):
     - It calculates the next occurrence year (`next_year`) by finding the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`. This is done using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
     - It updates `last_year` to `next_year`.
   
4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the calculated `last_year` for each test case.

### Validation with the Example:
Let's validate the program with the first test case from the example:
- **Input**: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- **Processing**:
  - For the first sign, `last_year = 3`.
  - For the second sign, `next_year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4`, so `last_year = 4`.
  - For the third sign, `next_year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8`, so `last_year = 8`.
  - For the fourth sign, `next_year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10`, so `last_year = 10`.
  - For the fifth sign, `next_year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18`, so `last_year = 18`.
  - For the sixth sign, `next_year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36`, so `last_year = 36`.
- **Output**: `36`

This matches the expected output for the first test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen for each test case based on the given periodicities. Therefore, the program is correct.
