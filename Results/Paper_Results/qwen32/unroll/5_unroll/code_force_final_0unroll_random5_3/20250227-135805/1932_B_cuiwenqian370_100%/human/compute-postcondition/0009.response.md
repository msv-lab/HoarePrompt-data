Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The function returns the periodicities of the signs for each test case.**
