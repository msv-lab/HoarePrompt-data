To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the provided code snippet on the initial state variables. The code snippet involves a loop that processes multiple test cases, updating the `index` and storing results in the `results` list. After processing all test cases, the results are printed.

Here's the breakdown of the changes:

- `input` remains unchanged.
- `data` remains unchanged.
- `index` is incremented by `1 + n` for each test case, so after all iterations, `index` will be `1 + sum(n_i)` where `n_i` is the number of elements in each test case.
- `T` remains unchanged.
- `results` will contain the final `last_year` values for each test case, each converted to a string.

The final print statement writes the joined `results` list to `sys.stdout` with newline characters.

Given this, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`input` remains unchanged; `data` remains unchanged; `index` is `1 + sum(n_i)` where `n_i` is the number of elements in each test case; `T` remains unchanged; `results` contains the final `last_year` values for each test case, each converted to a string; the final `last_year` values are printed, each on a new line.**
