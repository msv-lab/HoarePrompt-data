To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description, the code, and the function summary systematically.

### Problem Description Recap
The problem involves determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse occurs, given that:
- Each sign occurs every `a_i` years.
- Signs must occur sequentially, meaning the i-th sign can only occur after the (i-1)-th sign.

### Program Analysis
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the total number of test cases `T`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities into a list `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` with the year of the first sign's occurrence, which is `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula:
     ```python
     next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
     ```
   - This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year`.
3. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the year of the last sign's occurrence to the results list and prints the results for all test cases.

### Function Summary
The function summary correctly describes the program as processing multiple test cases and calculating the year in which all signs will be synchronized based on their periodicities. It outputs these synchronization years for all test cases.

### Verification of the Formula
The formula used to calculate `next_year` is:
```python
next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
```
This formula can be broken down as follows:
- `last_year + 1` ensures that we are looking for a year strictly after `last_year`.
- Adding `a[i] - 1` and then using integer division by `a[i]` ensures that we find the smallest integer multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.
- Multiplying by `a[i]` then gives the exact year which is the next multiple of `a[i]` after `last_year`.

### Validation Against Example
Let's validate the formula using the first example provided:
- **First Sign**: `a[0] = 3`, so `last_year = 3`.
- **Second Sign**: `a[1] = 2`, so `next_year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4`.
- **Third Sign**: `a[2] = 4`, so `next_year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8`.
- **Fourth Sign**: `a[3] = 5`, so `next_year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10`.
- **Fifth Sign**: `a[4] = 9`, so `next_year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18`.
- **Sixth Sign**: `a[5] = 18`, so `next_year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36`.

These calculations match the expected output for the first example.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse occurs, given the sequential requirement and periodicities of the signs. The formula used is accurate and the program handles multiple test cases correctly.

**Final: True**
