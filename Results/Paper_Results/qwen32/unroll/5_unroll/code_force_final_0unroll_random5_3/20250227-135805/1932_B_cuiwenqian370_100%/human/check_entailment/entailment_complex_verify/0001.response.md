Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided program and its annotated version to ensure it meets the problem's requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given that each sign must occur sequentially after the previous one, and each sign occurs periodically every `a_i` years.
- The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` is used to find the next occurrence year of the i-th sign that is strictly after the year of the (i-1)-th sign's occurrence.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the total number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
   - This formula ensures that the next sign occurs in the next possible year that is a multiple of `a[i]` and is strictly after `last_year`.
   - It updates `last_year` to the year of the current sign's occurrence.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the year of the last sign's occurrence to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Validation with Example:
Let's validate the program with the provided example:

**Example Input:**
```
4
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 1 1 1 1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```

**Expected Output:**
```
36
5
5
2012
```

**Program Execution:**
1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - `last_year = 3` (first sign)
   - `next_year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4` (second sign)
   - `next_year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8` (third sign)
   - `next_year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10` (fourth sign)
   - `next_year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18` (fifth sign)
   - `next_year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36` (sixth sign)
   - Result: `36`

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - `last_year = 1` (first sign)
   - `next_year = (1 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 2` (second sign)
   - `next_year = (2 + 1 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 3` (third sign)
   - `next_year = (3 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 4` (fourth sign)
   - `next_year = (4 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 5` (fifth sign)
   - Result: `5`

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - `last_year = 1` (first sign)
   - `next_year = (1 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 1` (second sign)
   - `next_year = (1 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 1` (third sign)
   - `next_year = (1 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 1` (fourth sign)
   - `next_year = (1 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 1` (fifth sign)
   - Result: `5`

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
   - `last_year = 50` (first sign)
   - `next_year = (50 + 1 + 30 - 1) // 30 * 30 = 60` (second sign)
   - `next_year = (60 + 1 + 711 - 1) // 711 * 711 = 771` (third sign)
   - `next_year = (771 + 1 + 200 - 1) // 200 * 200 = 800` (fourth sign)
   - `next_year = (800 + 1 + 503 - 1) // 503 * 503 = 1006` (fifth sign)
   - `next_year = (1006 + 1 + 1006 - 1) // 1006 * 1006 = 2012` (sixth sign)
   - Result: `2012`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case. The logic and formula used are correct and match the problem's requirements.

Final: **True**
