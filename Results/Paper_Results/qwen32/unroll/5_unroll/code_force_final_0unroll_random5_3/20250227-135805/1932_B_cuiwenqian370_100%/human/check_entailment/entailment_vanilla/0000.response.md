Reasoning:
The task requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse occurs, given that each sign must occur sequentially after the previous one, and each sign occurs periodically every a_i years.

The provided program reads the input correctly, iterating through each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of signs and their respective periodicities. It then calculates the year in which each sign occurs sequentially, starting from the first sign's occurrence year.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:
1. It reads the total number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of signs `n`.
   - It reads the periodicities of the signs into a list `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. This formula ensures that the next sign occurs in the next possible year that is a multiple of `a[i]` and is strictly after `last_year`.
   - It updates `last_year` to the year of the current sign's occurrence.
3. After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the year of the last sign's occurrence to the results list.
4. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The logic used in the program is correct for solving the problem as described. The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` correctly calculates the next occurrence year of the i-th sign that is strictly after the year of the (i-1)-th sign's occurrence.

Correctness: **True**
