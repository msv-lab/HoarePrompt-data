To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand what the loop does in each iteration. Here's a breakdown of the loop's operations:

1. **Input Reading**: For each test case, the loop reads two integers, `n` and `k`.
2. **List Initialization**: A list `nums` is initialized with powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).
3. **Index Calculation**: The loop calculates the largest index `idx` such that \(2^{idx} \leq k\).
4. **List Modification**:
   - A new element `k - nums[idx]` is added to `nums`.
   - Another new element `k + 1` is added to `nums`.
   - A third new element `k + nums[idx] + 1` is added to `nums`.
   - The element `2^{idx}` is removed from `nums`.
5. **Output**: The length of the modified list `nums` and the elements of `nums` are printed.

The initial state of the variables is given, but the loop modifies the list `nums` in each iteration based on the input values `n` and `k`. The initial state of `t` (the number of test cases) remains unchanged, and `n` and `k` are re-read for each test case.

After all iterations, the output state will be the result of the last test case processed by the loop. The values of `n` and `k` will be the values of the last test case, and `nums` will be the list after the last modification.

Given the loop's structure, the output state after all iterations will be the output of the last test case. Therefore, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of `nums` after the last test case is processed.**

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` for the last test case are not provided, we cannot specify the exact numerical values in the output state. However, the format of the output state will be:

Output State: **the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of `nums` after the last test case is processed.**
