You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    6 1
    
    8 8

    10 7

Output

    1

Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.

        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of `nums` after the last test case is processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it meets the problem requirements. The problem requires generating a sequence of non-negative integers such that:

1. There is no subsequence of the sequence with a sum equal to `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of the sequence with a sum equal to `v`.

The provided program generates a sequence based on powers of 2 and then modifies it to ensure the conditions are met. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
3. It generates a list `nums` containing the first 24 powers of 2: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^23]`.
4. It finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and removes it from the list.
5. It then adds three specific elements to the list:
   - `k - (highest power of 2 less than or equal to k)`
   - `k + 1`
   - `k + (highest power of 2 less than or equal to k) + 1`
6. Finally, it prints the length of the modified list and the elements of the list.

The goal is to ensure that no subsequence of the generated sequence sums to `k`, while all other sums from `1` to `n` (except `k`) can be achieved.

### Analysis:

- **Condition 1 (No subsequence sums to `k`):**
  - The program removes the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, and adds specific numbers that do not allow any subsequence to sum to `k` due to the unique construction.

- **Condition 2 (All sums from `1` to `n` except `k` can be achieved):**
  - The inclusion of the first 24 powers of 2 allows for the generation of a wide range of sums. The additional elements added ensure that all sums from `1` to `n` except `k` can be achieved.

However, there are some concerns:
- The program does not guarantee that the sequence length will be at most 25 for all cases. The list `nums` initially contains 24 elements, and three more are added, making it 27 elements in total. This exceeds the required maximum length of 25.
- The logic for ensuring the sums is correct, but the sequence length constraint is not met.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirement that the sequence length should be at most 25. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
