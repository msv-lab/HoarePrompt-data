Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits. The program uses a helper function `func_1` to check if the current state of the array is sorted.

However, the program has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop Condition and Placement**: The loop that checks and potentially splits elements is not correctly placed or structured. The loop should iterate over the array and attempt to split elements as long as the array is not sorted, not just once per element. The loop currently only checks the condition once per test case and only splits elements if the condition is not met, which is insufficient.

2. **Incorrect Logic in Splitting**: The logic for splitting elements and inserting the digits back into the list is flawed. The program only splits the element at position `p-1` if it is greater than the element at position `p` and greater than 10. This logic does not handle all cases where splitting could help sort the array. Moreover, the program does not ensure that after splitting, the array is checked again to see if it can be sorted further.

3. **Helper Function Misuse**: The helper function `func_1` is used incorrectly. The function is called before any splitting occurs, and if the array is already sorted, it prints 'Yes' and moves on to the next test case. However, if the array is not sorted, the program only attempts to split once and then checks if the array is sorted again, which might not be sufficient.

4. **State of the Program Before Function Call**: The description of the state of the program before the function call is incorrect. The function `func_1` is not supposed to handle a list of lists; it should handle a single list (the array for a single test case).

Given these issues, the program is not correctly implemented to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
