lst is a list of integers where each integer represents a test case. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). The length of lst is 2 * t + 1, where t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) is the number of test cases, and the first element of each test case (except the first element of lst which is t) is the count of integers in the subsequent list for that test case.
