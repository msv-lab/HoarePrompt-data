### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits.

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `list1` itself.

2. **Transformation Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - It checks if the array is already sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - If the array is not sorted, it checks if the current element is greater than the previous one and if the previous one is at least 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - The loop continues until the end of the array.

3. **Checking Sortedness**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Transformation Logic**:
   - The program only checks and transforms the array once per test case, which may not be sufficient.
   - It should keep transforming the array until no more transformations can be made or until it is sorted.

2. **Logic Error in Transformation**:
   - The transformation logic only considers the previous element if it is greater than the current one and at least 10.
   - This logic is flawed because it might skip necessary transformations and incorrectly conclude that the array is not sortable.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop only goes through the array once, which might not be enough to fully transform the array into a sorted state.
   - A nested loop or a while loop should be used to repeatedly check and transform the array until it is either sorted or no further transformations can be made.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
