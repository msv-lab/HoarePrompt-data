The code sorts the list `lst` of lists, and assigns the sorted list to `sorted_lst`. The sorting is based on the default lexicographical order of the sublists. The original list `lst` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. The outer list `lst` contains t sublists (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), where each sublist represents the array a for a separate test case. `sorted_lst` is the sorted version of `lst` based on the default lexicographical order of the sublists.**
