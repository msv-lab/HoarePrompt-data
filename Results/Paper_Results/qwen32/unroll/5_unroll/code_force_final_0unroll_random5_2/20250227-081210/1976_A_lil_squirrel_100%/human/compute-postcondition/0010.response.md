The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `len(password) - 1`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to ensure the loop executes.

The loop will execute if `len(password) - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, which means `len(password)` must be at least 2. Given that `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 20`, we need to ensure `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.

The initial state already provides that `n` is a positive integer and `password` is a string of length `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure `n` is at least 2.

Since `i` is the loop variable that will be initialized to 0 before the loop starts, we do not need to adjust it.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`, `letters` is sorted, and `digits` is sorted**.
