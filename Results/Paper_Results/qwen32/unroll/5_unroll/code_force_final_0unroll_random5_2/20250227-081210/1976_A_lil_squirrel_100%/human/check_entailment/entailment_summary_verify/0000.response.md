### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem description and the provided code to ensure everything aligns correctly.

#### Problem Description Recap:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit should come after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
5. The password can have only letters or only digits.

#### Provided Code:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
The function `func_1` checks if the password meets the criteria:
- All letters must be in alphabetical order.
- All digits must be in ascending order.
- No letter should be immediately followed by a digit.
If the password meets these criteria, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

#### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Sorting Checks**:
   - `if letters != sorted(letters)`: This checks if the letters in the password are sorted. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - `if digits != sorted(digits)`: This checks if the digits in the password are sorted. If not, it returns 'NO'.

2. **Digit Following Letter Check**:
   - `for i in range(len(password) - 1)`: This loop checks if any digit comes immediately after a letter. If it does, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Character Password**: If the password has only one character (either a letter or a digit), it will pass the sorting checks since a single character is trivially sorted.
   - **All Identical Characters**: If the password consists of all identical characters (either all letters or all digits), it will also pass the sorting checks for the same reason.
   - **Mixed Characters**: The code correctly checks that no digit follows a letter.

#### Original Assessment Recap:
- The original assessment states that the code is correct because it handles all the specified conditions and edge cases correctly.
- It also mentions that the code does not explicitly handle the cases where the password consists only of letters or only of digits, but it still works correctly due to the nature of the sorting checks.

#### Evaluation:
The code correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description. It handles all edge cases, including passwords with only letters or only digits, correctly. The original assessment is accurate in stating that the code is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
