### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem by performing at most two swaps on the permutation array to ensure that after applying a binary search, the element at the position `l` is equal to `x`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the length of the permutation) and `x` (the number to be found).
   - It then reads the permutation array `p`.

2. **Mapping and Initialization:**
   - A dictionary `num_indx` is created to map each number in the permutation to its index (1-based).
   - An array `seen` is initialized to keep track of which elements have been encountered during the binary search process.

3. **Binary Search Simulation:**
   - The binary search is simulated using two pointers `left` and `right`. Initially, `left` is set to 0 and `right` is set to `n`.
   - The loop continues until `right - left` is equal to 1.
   - In each iteration, the middle index `mid` is calculated.
   - The element at `mid` is marked as seen.
   - Depending on whether the element at `mid` is less than or equal to `x`, either `left` or `right` is updated.

4. **Determining the Result:**
   - If the element at `left` is equal to `x`, no swaps are needed, and the result is `0`.
   - If `x` was never seen during the binary search, only one swap is needed to place `x` at the correct position. The program identifies the position of `x` in the permutation and prints a swap operation.
   - If `x` was seen but not at the correct position, the program identifies an unseen element and performs two swaps to place `x` at the correct position.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the number of swaps performed and the indices of the elements to be swapped.

### Correctness:

The program correctly simulates the binary search and determines the necessary swaps to ensure that the element at the position `l` is equal to `x` after the binary search. The logic for handling the cases where `x` is not seen or seen but not at the correct position is accurate. The program adheres to the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Thus, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
