To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether the given code correctly solves the problem as described. The problem requires us to perform up to two swaps on a permutation to ensure that a binary search will correctly find the number `x` in the list `p`.

Let's break down the problem and the code:

1. **Problem Analysis:**
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
   - We can perform up to two swaps on the permutation.
   - After the swaps, a binary search should result in `p_l` being equal to `x`.

2. **Binary Search Process:**
   - The binary search starts with `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`.
   - It continues until `r - l = 1`.
   - In each iteration, it calculates `m = floor((r + l) / 2)`.
   - If `p[m] <= x`, then `l = m`; otherwise, `r = m`.
   - The goal is to ensure that `p[l]` equals `x` after the binary search.

3. **Approach:**
   - To guarantee that `p[l]` equals `x`, we need to position `x` in such a way that it is found by the binary search.
   - This can often be achieved by placing `x` at the correct position or by ensuring that the binary search steps lead to `x`.

4. **Code Analysis:**
   - The provided code includes functions to read input values, but it does not contain the main logic for solving the problem.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are simply for reading input data.
   - There is no function or logic provided to perform the swaps or to implement the binary search.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code does not include the necessary logic to solve the problem.
   - It only includes functions to read input data, which is not sufficient to determine if `x` can be found after performing up to two swaps.
   - Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not implement the required solution.

**Reasoning:**
The provided code lacks the implementation for the main logic needed to solve the problem. It only includes input reading functions, which is insufficient to determine if `x` can be found after performing up to two swaps and running the binary search.

**Correctness: False**
