### Reasoning:
Let's re-evaluate the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version to determine if the given program is correct based on the problem statement.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Field Representation**: The field is represented as a 2D grid with characters indicating entities (players, goals, Quaffle, Bludger).
2. **Actions**: Entities can move (U, D, L, R), catch the Quaffle (C), or throw the Quaffle (T).
3. **Scoring**: A team scores if a player throws the Quaffle into the opposing team's goal.
4. **Elimination**: A player is eliminated if they occupy the same cell as the Bludger.
5. **Output**: Events (goals and eliminations) with timestamps, and the final score.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code contains two functions:
1. **`func_1(obj, d)`**: This function updates the position of an object (`obj`) based on the direction (`d`).
2. **`func_2(t)`**: This function checks for players that are eliminated by the Bludger and prints the elimination event with the timestamp (`t`).

The main part of the code initializes the field, players, goals, Quaffle, and Bludger positions. It then processes the actions step-by-step, updating positions, handling catches and throws, and checking for goals and eliminations.

#### Key Points from the Annotated Code:
- **Initialization**: The code correctly initializes the field, players, goals, Quaffle, and Bludger positions.
- **Action Handling**: The code correctly handles the actions (U, D, L, R, C, T).
- **Goal Scoring**: The code correctly handles scoring when the Quaffle is thrown into a goal.
- **Bludger Interaction**: The code correctly checks for players that are eliminated by the Bludger.
- **Output**: The code correctly prints the events (goals and eliminations) with timestamps and the final score.

#### Evaluation of Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, confirming that the logic is correctly implemented:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: The function correctly updates the position of an object based on the direction.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: The function correctly identifies and eliminates players that are in the same cell as the Bludger.
- **Main Loop**: The main loop correctly processes each action, updating positions, handling catches and throws, and checking for goals and eliminations.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code, including the annotations, correctly implements the problem requirements. It initializes the field, processes actions, handles scoring, checks for eliminations, and outputs the correct events and final score.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
