Postcondition: **`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field. If `d` is 'R', the second integer (y-coordinate) of `obj` has been incremented by 1. `d` is a character that can be 'R' or 'D', and `d` is not equal to 'U'. If `d` is 'D', the coordinates of `obj` remain unchanged.**
