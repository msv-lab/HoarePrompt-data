Postcondition: **`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field. If `d` is 'U', the first integer (x-coordinate) of `obj` is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'D', the first integer (x-coordinate) of `obj` is incremented by 1. If `d` is 'L', the second integer (y-coordinate) of `obj` is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'R', the second integer (y-coordinate) of `obj` is incremented by 1. `d` is a character that can be 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'.**
