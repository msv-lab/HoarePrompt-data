You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: obj is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field, and d is a character that can be 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', representing the direction of movement.
def func_1(obj, d):
    if (d == 'U') :
        obj[0] -= 1
    else :
        if (d == 'D') :
            obj[0] += 1
        else :
            if (d == 'L') :
                obj[1] -= 1
            else :
                if (d == 'R') :
                    obj[1] += 1
                #State: `obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field. If `d` is 'R', the second integer (y-coordinate) of `obj` has been incremented by 1. `d` is a character that can be 'R' or 'D', and `d` is not equal to 'U'. If `d` is 'D', the coordinates of `obj` remain unchanged.
            #State: `obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field. If `d` is 'L', the second integer (y-coordinate) of `obj` is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'R', the second integer (y-coordinate) of `obj` is incremented by 1. If `d` is 'D', the coordinates of `obj` remain unchanged. `d` is a character that can be 'L', 'R', or 'D', and `d` is not equal to 'U'.
        #State: `obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field. If `d` is 'D', the first integer (x-coordinate) of `obj` is incremented by 1. If `d` is 'L', the second integer (y-coordinate) of `obj` is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'R', the second integer (y-coordinate) of `obj` is incremented by 1. `d` is a character that can be 'L', 'R', or 'D', and `d` is not equal to 'U'.
    #State: `obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field. If `d` is 'U', the first integer (x-coordinate) of `obj` is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'D', the first integer (x-coordinate) of `obj` is incremented by 1. If `d` is 'L', the second integer (y-coordinate) of `obj` is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'R', the second integer (y-coordinate) of `obj` is incremented by 1. `d` is a character that can be 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `obj`, which is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field, and a parameter `d`, which is a character that can be 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', representing the direction of movement. The function returns the new coordinates of the entity after moving in the specified direction.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
