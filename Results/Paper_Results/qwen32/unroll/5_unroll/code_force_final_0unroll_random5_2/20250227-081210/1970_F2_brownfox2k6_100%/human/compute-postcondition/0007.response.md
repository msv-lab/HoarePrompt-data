The code snippet `obj[1] -= 1` decrements the second element of the list `obj` by 1. Given that `obj` is a list of two integers representing coordinates, this means the y-coordinate (or the second coordinate) of the entity on the field is decreased by 1. The direction `d` remains unchanged as 'L'.

Output State: **`obj` is a list of two integers where the second integer is decreased by 1, and `d` is 'L'.**
