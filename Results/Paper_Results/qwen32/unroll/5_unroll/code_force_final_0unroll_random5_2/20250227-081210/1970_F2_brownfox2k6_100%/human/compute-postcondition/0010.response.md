Output State: **`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field, where the second integer (y-coordinate) has been incremented by 1; `d` is a character that can be 'R', 'R', or 'D', and `d` is not equal to 'U'. The current value of `d` is 'R'.**

Natural Language: The y-coordinate of the entity represented by `obj` has been increased by 1. The value of `d` remains 'R' and still cannot be 'U'.
