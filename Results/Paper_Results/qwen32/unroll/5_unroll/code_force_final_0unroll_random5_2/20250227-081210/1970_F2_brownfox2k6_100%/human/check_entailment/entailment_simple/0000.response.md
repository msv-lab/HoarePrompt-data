### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness based on the provided problem description and the annotated states.

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field (N, M).
   - It initializes lists for red goals (`rg`), blue goals (`bg`), and the position of the Bludger (`blud`).
   - It also initializes a dictionary (`player`) to store the positions of all players.
   - The Quaffle's initial position is stored in `ball`.

2. **Processing Actions:**
   - The program iterates over the T actions.
   - For each action, it checks the type of action (`C`, `T`, or movement).
   - If the action is `C` (catch), it sets `carry` to the player who caught the Quaffle.
   - If the action is `T` (throw), it resets `carry` to `None` and checks if the Quaffle is in a goal. If so, it updates the score and resets the Quaffle to the middle of the field.
   - For movement actions (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), it calls `func_1` to update the position of the entity (player, Quaffle, or Bludger).
   - After moving a player, it calls `func_2` to check if the player is eliminated by the Bludger.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function updates the position of an entity based on the direction of movement (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).
   - It correctly adjusts the x and y coordinates of the entity.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function checks if any player is in the same position as the Bludger.
   - If a player is eliminated, it marks the player's position as `[-1, -1]` and prints the elimination event.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the score events (`RED GOAL` or `BLUE GOAL`) and elimination events (`ELIMINATED`) as they occur.
   - At the end of the game, it prints the final score.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - The program correctly identifies that the blue team scores at time 11 and prints `11 BLUE GOAL`.
  - The final score is `FINAL SCORE: 0 1`.

- **Example 2:**
  - The program correctly identifies that the blue team scores at time 4 and prints `4 BLUE GOAL`.
  - The final score is `FINAL SCORE: 0 1`.

- **Example 3:**
  - The program correctly identifies that R0 and B0 are eliminated at times 2 and 4, respectively, and prints the elimination events.
  - The final score is `FINAL SCORE: 0 0`.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to handle all the specified cases correctly. The logic for movement, scoring, and elimination is consistent with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
