The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns them to the variable `nums`. The initial state mentions that `n` is the first integer read from the input for the current test case, and `c` is a list of `n` integers. After executing the code, `nums` will hold the integers read from the input, which corresponds to the list `c` as described in the initial state. The values of `t`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input for the current test case; `q` is the second integer read from the input for the current test case; `c` is a list of n integers where each integer c_i is such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer nums_i is such that 1 <= nums_i <= 10^9, and nums is equal to c.**
