To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the behavior of the function `func_1`. However, since `func_1` is not defined in the problem statement, we will assume that `func_1` performs some operation on the two input values, such as multiplication, addition, etc. For the sake of this example, let's assume `func_1` multiplies its two arguments.

Given that the initial state is:
- `numbers` is a list of integers.
- `result` is initialized to the first element of `numbers`.

The loop iterates over the elements of `numbers` starting from the second element. In each iteration, `result` is updated by applying `func_1` to the current `result` and the current element of `numbers`.

Let's assume `numbers = [a, b, c, d]` and `func_1(x, y) = x * y`.

1. Initial State: `result = a`
2. First Iteration: `result = func_1(a, b) = a * b`
3. Second Iteration: `result = func_1(a * b, c) = a * b * c`
4. Third Iteration: `result = func_1(a * b * c, d) = a * b * c * d`

After the loop finishes, the `result` will be the product of all elements in the `numbers` list.

Hence, the output state will be:

Output State: **result is the product of all elements in the `numbers` list.**
