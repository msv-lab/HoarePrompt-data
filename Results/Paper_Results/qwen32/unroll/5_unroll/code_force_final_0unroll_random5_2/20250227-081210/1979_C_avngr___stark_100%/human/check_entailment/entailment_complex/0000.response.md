Reasoning:
The provided code is intended to solve the problem of distributing bets on outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. The solution leverages the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers to determine the bets.

Here is a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Reading Input:** The code reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome.

2. **Function `func_1`:** This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers by using the formula:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
   \]
   This is correctly implemented in the function.

3. **Function `func_2`:** This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the current result and the next number in the list. This ensures that the final result is the LCM of all the numbers in the list.

4. **Determining Bets:** After calculating the LCM of the multipliers, the code then determines the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the corresponding multiplier. This ensures that the sum of all bets is less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

5. **Checking Validity:** The code checks if the sum of the bets is less than the LCM. If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints -1 indicating that no valid distribution is possible.

6. **Output:** For each test case, the code outputs either the bets or -1.

The logic behind the solution is sound. The LCM ensures that the sum of the bets is minimized while still meeting the condition that the amount received for any winning outcome is strictly greater than the total amount bet. The code correctly implements this logic.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
