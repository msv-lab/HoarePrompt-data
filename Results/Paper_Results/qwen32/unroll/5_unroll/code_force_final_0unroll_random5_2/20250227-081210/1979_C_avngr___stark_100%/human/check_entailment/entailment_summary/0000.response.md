### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that it correctly implements the solution for the problem described. The problem requires us to find a way to distribute the bets such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received in the event of any winning outcome.

Let's analyze the provided functions and the overall logic:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - The formula `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)` correctly computes the LCM.

2. **Function `func_2(numbers)`**:
   - This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers.
   - It iteratively applies the `func_1` function to the list of numbers, which correctly computes the LCM of the entire list.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic calculates the LCM of the multipliers `k` for each test case.
   - It then determines the bets `c` by dividing the LCM by each multiplier `k[i]`.
   - The sum of the bets `c` is checked to ensure it is less than the LCM. If not, it prints `-1`.
   - If the sum of the bets is valid, it prints the bets.

### Verification:

Let's verify if the main logic correctly solves the problem:

- **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the total sum of the bets can be distributed in a way that satisfies the condition for all possible winning outcomes.
- **Bet Distribution**: By dividing the LCM by each multiplier `k[i]`, we ensure that the bet on each outcome is such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received in the event of that outcome winning.
- **Condition Check**: The condition `sum(c) < m` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the solution for the problem. It calculates the LCM of the multipliers and distributes the bets accordingly, ensuring that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. Therefore, the program is correct.
