Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. There are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Winner Determination**: The core logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program calculates `total_digits` as the sum of the lengths of the numbers in the list and counts the trailing zeros in each number. However, the strategy for subtracting zeros and comparing the result to `m + 1` does not align with the game rules or optimal play strategies for Anna and Sasha.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Leading Zeros**: The function `func_1` correctly counts trailing zeros, but the program does not handle leading zeros correctly when reversing numbers. The problem description specifies that leading zeros should be removed after reversing a number, which the program does not account for.

3. **Incorrect Winner Assignment**: The program assigns 'Sashah' as the winner instead of 'Sasha', which is a typo.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy**: The program does not simulate the optimal play strategy for both players. It assumes a specific strategy for Sasha (subtracting zeros) without considering the optimal strategy for Anna, which could involve reversing numbers to minimize the final number's size.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the winner for all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
