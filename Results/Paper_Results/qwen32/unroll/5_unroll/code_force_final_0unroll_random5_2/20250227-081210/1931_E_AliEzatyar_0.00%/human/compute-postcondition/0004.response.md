Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of a list containing two integers `n` and `m`, followed by a list of `n` integers. The function returns the number of consecutive '0's found at the end of the list of integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) before encountering a non-'0' value.**
