The given code snippet initializes a variable `counter` to 0. No other variables are affected, and the initial state of `num` (which is a list of test cases) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a list of test cases, where each test case is represented as a list containing two integers n and m, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n; `counter` is 0.**
