The provided code snippet only reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and does not process or modify any variables. Therefore, the state remains unchanged after executing this code. The initial state specifies the format of the input, and since no operations are performed on the input data, the input format remains valid.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting only of characters 'U' and 'D', where 'U' represents a coin facing up and 'D' represents a coin facing down.**
