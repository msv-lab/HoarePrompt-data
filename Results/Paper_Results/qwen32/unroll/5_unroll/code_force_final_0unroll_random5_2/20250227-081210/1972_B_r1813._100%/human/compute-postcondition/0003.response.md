The code snippet provided initializes a variable `index` with the value `1`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Initial State: `data` is a list containing the number of test cases `t` as the first element and the first test case's `n` and `s` as the subsequent elements; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.

After the execution of `index = 1`, the variable `index` is set to `1`, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing the number of test cases `t` as the first element and the first test case's `n` and `s` as the subsequent elements; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `index` is 1.**
