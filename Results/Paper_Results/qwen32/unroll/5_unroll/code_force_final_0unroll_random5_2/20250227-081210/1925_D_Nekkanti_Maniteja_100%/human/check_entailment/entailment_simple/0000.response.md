Let's analyze the given program for correctness based on the problem description and the annotated states.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of children.
     - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
     - `k`: Number of excursions.
     - `m` lines of `a_i`, `b_i`, `f_i`: Friend pairs and their initial friendship values.

2. **Objective:**
   - Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - Output the result as `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)` where `p/q` is the expected value in its simplest form.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions as follows:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `M = 10 ** 9 + 7`: Modulus value.
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`: Modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children.
   - `s = 0`: Sum to accumulate the expected value.
   - `a = 0`: Sum of initial friendship values of all friend pairs.

2. **Processing Friend Pairs:**
   - For each friend pair `(u, v, f)`, add `f` to `a`.

3. **Calculating Expected Value:**
   - For each excursion `i` from `0` to `k-1`:
     - Update `s` using the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - Print `s % M`.

### Issues in the Program
The logic in the program for updating `s` seems incorrect. The formula used inside the loop is not aligning with the expected value calculation.

#### Correct Approach
The expected value calculation should consider the following:
- For each excursion, the probability of choosing any specific pair is `c = 1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
- The expected contribution of a friend pair `(u, v)` with initial friendship value `f_i` to the total sum over `k` excursions is:
  - The sum of an arithmetic series for the increased friendship values over `k` excursions.
  - The expected number of times the pair is chosen is `k * c`.
  - The expected contribution is therefore `k * c * (f_i + (k-1) * c * m / 2)`.

However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic. The term `c * i * c * m + c * a` does not accurately reflect the expected value calculation.

### Conclusion
Given the issues in the provided program logic, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
