Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The program calculates the expected value incorrectly. The expected value should consider the probability of selecting each pair of friends and the contribution of their friendship values over k excursions.
   - The current implementation does not correctly compute the expected value. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that the probability of selecting a specific pair of friends is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\), and the contribution of each pair should be weighted by this probability.
   - The program incorrectly uses `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` which is the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, but it does not correctly apply this inverse in the calculation of the expected value.

2. **Incorrect Accumulation of Scores**:
   - The loop `for i in range(k):` incorrectly accumulates the scores. The expected value calculation should consider the cumulative increase in friendship values over k excursions, but the current implementation does not correctly handle this.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Non-Friend Pairs**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where there are no friend pairs (i.e., \(m = 0\)). While the program outputs 0 in this case, the logic used to compute the expected value is flawed and would not work correctly for other cases.

Here is a potential test case that the program fails:

**Test Case**:
```
1
5 2 4
1 2 25
3 4 24
```

**Expected Output**:
```
40000020
```

**Actual Output**:
The program would likely output an incorrect value because of the flawed expected value calculation.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Calculate the probability of selecting each pair of friends.
2. Compute the expected increase in friendship values for each pair over k excursions.
3. Sum these expected values to get the final result.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
