Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It also receives `m` lines of input, each containing integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, which represent pairs of distinct nodes and a value associated with each pair. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific output for each test case based on the provided constraints.**
