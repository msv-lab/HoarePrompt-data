You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5. For each of the m lines in a test case, a_i, b_i, and f_i are integers where a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. It is guaranteed that all pairs (a_i, b_i) are distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        
        print(s % M)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output is \((c^2 \cdot m \cdot \frac{(k-1)k}{2} + c \cdot a \cdot k) \% M\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `m` pairs of distinct nodes with associated values. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on these inputs, using modular arithmetic with a modulus of \(10^9 + 7\). The final output for each test case is determined by a formula involving the sum of the associated values and a series calculation.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The program calculates the expected value incorrectly. The expected value should consider the probability of selecting each pair of friends and the contribution of their friendship values over k excursions.
   - The current implementation does not correctly compute the expected value. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that the probability of selecting a specific pair of friends is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\), and the contribution of each pair should be weighted by this probability.
   - The program incorrectly uses `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` which is the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, but it does not correctly apply this inverse in the calculation of the expected value.

2. **Incorrect Accumulation of Scores**:
   - The loop `for i in range(k):` incorrectly accumulates the scores. The expected value calculation should consider the cumulative increase in friendship values over k excursions, but the current implementation does not correctly handle this.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Non-Friend Pairs**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where there are no friend pairs (i.e., \(m = 0\)). While the program outputs 0 in this case, the logic used to compute the expected value is flawed and would not work correctly for other cases.

Here is a potential test case that the program fails:

**Test Case**:
```
1
5 2 4
1 2 25
3 4 24
```

**Expected Output**:
```
40000020
```

**Actual Output**:
The program would likely output an incorrect value because of the flawed expected value calculation.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Calculate the probability of selecting each pair of friends.
2. Compute the expected increase in friendship values for each pair over k excursions.
3. Sum these expected values to get the final result.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
