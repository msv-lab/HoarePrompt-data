Reasoning:

The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, and then outputting the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Let's break down the logic and see if it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. It also initializes `M` to \(10^9 + 7\), which is the modulus value.

2. **Calculating the Inverse**: The program calculates the modular inverse of the total possible pairs of children, `n * (n - 1) // 2`, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This inverse is stored in `c`.

3. **Summing Initial Friendship Values**: The program then reads the `m` pairs of friends and their friendship values, summing up all the initial friendship values into `a`.

4. **Calculating the Expected Value**: The program uses a loop to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions. The formula used inside the loop is `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This seems to be an attempt to calculate the expected value based on the sum of the series, but there are a couple of issues here:
   - The formula inside the loop is incorrect. It seems to be trying to calculate the expected value incrementally, but the way it's structured doesn't match the expected mathematical derivation.
   - The loop itself is not necessary. The expected value can be derived using a closed-form formula, which is more efficient given the constraints.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of the calculation modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The main issue with the program is the incorrect formula used to calculate the expected value. The expected value should be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series and the properties of expected values, which the program does not correctly implement.

The correct approach should be:
- Calculate the expected increase in the sum of friendship values due to the random selections.
- Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the expected value.
- Compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the issues with the formula used in the program, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
