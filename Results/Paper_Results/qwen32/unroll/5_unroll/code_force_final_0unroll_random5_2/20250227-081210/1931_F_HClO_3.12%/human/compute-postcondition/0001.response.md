In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it inherently satisfies the condition to execute the loop at least once.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop executes. The state is already suitable for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
