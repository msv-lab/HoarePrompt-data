test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple (n, k, screenshots). n is an integer representing the number of chat participants (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). k is an integer representing the number of participants who posted screenshots (1 ≤ k ≤ n). screenshots is a list of k lists, where each inner list contains n integers representing the order of participants shown to the participant who posted the screenshot. Each integer in the inner list is between 1 and n (inclusive), and all integers in each inner list are unique. The sum of n · k for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. All authors of the screenshots are different.
