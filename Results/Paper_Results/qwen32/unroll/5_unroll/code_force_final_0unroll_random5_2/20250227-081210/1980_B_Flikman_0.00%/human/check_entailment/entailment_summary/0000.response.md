### Reasoning:
Let's break down the logic of the program to ensure it aligns with the problem requirements.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the values `n`, `f`, and `k` are read.
   - The list `a` of `n` integers is read.

2. **Favorite Cube Value:**
   - The value of the favorite cube `favorite_value` is determined by `a[f - 1]`.

3. **Counting Values:**
   - The program counts how many cubes have the same value as the favorite cube (`same_value_count`).
   - The program counts how many cubes have a value greater than the favorite cube (`greater_count`).

4. **Determine Output:**
   - If `greater_count >= k`, it means there are at least `k` cubes with greater values, so the favorite cube will always be removed. Hence, the output is 'YES'.
   - If `greater_count + same_value_count <= k`, it means even including the cubes with the same value as the favorite cube, there are not enough cubes to exceed `k`. Thus, the favorite cube will never be removed. Hence, the output is 'NO'.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it means the favorite cube could either be removed or not removed depending on the exact order of cubes with the same value. Hence, the output is 'MAYBE'.

The logic of the program correctly implements the conditions described in the problem statement. It correctly counts the necessary values and makes the appropriate decision based on the counts.
