Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For each test case, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `f`, `k` <= `n` <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the input, while the preconditions for `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
