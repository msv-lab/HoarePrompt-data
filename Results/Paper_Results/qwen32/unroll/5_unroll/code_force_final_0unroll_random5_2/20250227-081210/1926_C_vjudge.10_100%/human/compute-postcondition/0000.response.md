The code snippet provided initializes a variable `inf` with the value `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1`. This means `inf` is set to `200001`. None of the other variables (`t` or `n`) are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes for that test case; `inf` is 200001.**
