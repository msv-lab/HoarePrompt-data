Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program has a logical error that can be observed in the function `func_1()`. The function is supposed to calculate the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n` and then store the cumulative sum of these digit sums in the `values` list. However, the function `func_1()` is not called properly in the code snippet provided, and the function definition is placed after its call, which will lead to a `NameError`.

Even if we assume that the function call and definition are correctly placed, there is another issue with the logic. The precomputation of the `values` list is done up to a fixed limit (`inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1`), which is fine for the given constraints. However, the function `func_1()` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading an integer `n` and printing `values[n]`. This will work correctly only if `n` is less than or equal to `inf`.

The problem description does not specify that `n` will always be less than or equal to `inf`, but given the constraints, it is reasonable to assume that `n` will not exceed `2 * 10 ** 5`. However, the code does not handle cases where `n` might exceed this limit, although the problem constraints ensure that this won't happen. 

The main issue here is the incorrect placement of the function definition and the call, which will cause the code to fail to execute as intended.

To correct this, the function call should be placed after the function definition, and the function should be called to process the input correctly. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        print(values[value])

func_1()
```

With this correction, the code should work as expected for all valid inputs within the given constraints. However, since the original code snippet provided has the function call before its definition, it is considered incorrect.
