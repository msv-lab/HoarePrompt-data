Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) and stores the cumulative sum in the `values` array. For each test case, it simply retrieves the precomputed cumulative sum up to \(n\) and prints it. This approach ensures that each test case is handled efficiently within the time limit, as the preprocessing step (computing the cumulative sums) is done only once before handling any test cases.
