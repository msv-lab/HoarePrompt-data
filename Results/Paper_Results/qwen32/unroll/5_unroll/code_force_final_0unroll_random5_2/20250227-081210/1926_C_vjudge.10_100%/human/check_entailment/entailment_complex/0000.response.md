### Reasoning:
The provided program `func_1` is designed to solve the problem by precomputing the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 (since `n` can be as large as 200,000). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `inf` is set to 200,001 to accommodate the range from 1 to 200,000.
   - `t` is read from the input, representing the number of test cases.
   - `values` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of `inf`.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - A loop iterates through each number `i` from 1 to 200,000.
   - For each number `i`, the sum of its digits is calculated.
   - The cumulative sum of these digit sums up to `i` is stored in `values[i]`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each of the `t` test cases, an integer `n` is read from the input.
   - The precomputed cumulative sum of digit sums up to `n` is retrieved from `values[n]` and printed.

### Correctness:
The program correctly precomputes the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers up to 200,000. This allows it to efficiently handle up to 10,000 test cases within the given time constraints, as each test case simply involves a single lookup in the `values` list. The logic aligns with the problem statement, and the output will be correct for all valid inputs as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
