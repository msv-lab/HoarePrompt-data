The code initializes a list named `values` with 200001 elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n` as they are not modified in this snippet. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `n` is the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case. The value of `inf` is given as 200001, which is used to determine the size of the `values` list.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes for that test case; `inf` is 200001; `t` is an input integer; `values` is a list of 200001 elements, all initialized to 0.**
