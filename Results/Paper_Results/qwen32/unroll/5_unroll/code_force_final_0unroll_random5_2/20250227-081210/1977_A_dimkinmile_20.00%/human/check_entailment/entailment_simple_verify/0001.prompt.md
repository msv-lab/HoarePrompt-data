You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n >= m) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: `n` and `m` are integers where `n` represents the number of moves and `m` represents the desired number of cubes in the tower. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, then `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. Otherwise, `n` is less than `m`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The task is to determine if it's possible to have a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube. 

The provided program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. The program then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise it prints "No".

However, this logic is incorrect. The number of moves `n` must be able to accommodate the difference between the final number of cubes `m` and the initial number of cubes (which is 0). Specifically, the number of moves `n` must be at least `m` (if `m` is positive) because each cube added requires one move. Moreover, `n` must be such that it can also account for any necessary removals of cubes if `m` is less than the maximum number of cubes that could be added (which is `n`). 

The correct condition should be that `n` must be at least `m` and `n - m` must be even (because for every cube added, there must be a way to balance the moves, and the difference `n - m` must be an even number to account for both additions and removals).

However, the given program only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which does not fully cover the requirement for the problem. For example, if `n = 3` and `m = 2`, the program would output "Yes", but in reality, this is not possible because Nikita would need to add 2 cubes and then remove 1, which would require an odd number of moves, not an even number. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
