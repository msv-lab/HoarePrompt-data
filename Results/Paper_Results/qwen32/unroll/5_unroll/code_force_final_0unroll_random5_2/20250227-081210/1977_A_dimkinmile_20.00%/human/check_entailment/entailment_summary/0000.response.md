Reasoning:
The program is designed to determine if it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move is either adding or removing exactly one cube. The core logic in the function `func_1` checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes). This logic is based on the observation that if the number of moves is at least equal to the number of cubes desired, it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes by adding one cube per move until the desired number is reached. If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n`.

However, this logic is not entirely correct. The problem does not only consider adding cubes but also removing them. Therefore, the correct condition should be that `n` must be at least `abs(m)`, but more importantly, `n` must be able to account for both additions and subtractions to reach `m`. A more accurate condition would be that `n` must be at least `m` if `m` is positive, or `n` must be at least `-m` if `m` is negative, but since `m` is constrained to be non-negative, the condition simplifies to `n` being at least `m` and `n` being even if `m` is not reachable by just adding cubes (i.e., `n - m` must be even).

The given program does not account for the possibility of removing cubes, and it does not check if the difference `n - m` is even, which is necessary to determine if the desired number of cubes can be achieved. Therefore, the logic is flawed for cases where `n` is greater than `m` but the difference is odd, as it would be impossible to reach `m` cubes in such a case.

Correctness: **False**
