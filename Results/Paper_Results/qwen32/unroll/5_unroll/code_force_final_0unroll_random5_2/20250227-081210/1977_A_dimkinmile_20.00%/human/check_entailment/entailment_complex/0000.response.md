### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine whether it is possible to end up with a tower of `m` cubes after performing exactly `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube from the tower. 

The logic in the function `func_1` is as follows:
- It reads two integers `n` and `m`.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints "Yes".
- Otherwise, it prints "No".

This logic is based on the observation that if the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the desired number of cubes `m`, it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes by adding one cube per move until `m` cubes are reached. If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n`.

Let's verify this with the example provided in the problem statement:

1. **First Test Case (n=3, m=3)**:
   - Moves: 3
   - Desired cubes: 3
   - Since `n` (3) is equal to `m` (3), it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes by adding one cube per move.
   - Expected Output: "Yes"
   - Program Output: "Yes"

2. **Second Test Case (n=2, m=4)**:
   - Moves: 2
   - Desired cubes: 4
   - Since `n` (2) is less than `m` (4), it is not possible to achieve the desired number of cubes because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n` (2).
   - Expected Output: "No"
   - Program Output: "No"

3. **Third Test Case (n=5, m=3)**:
   - Moves: 5
   - Desired cubes: 3
   - Since `n` (5) is greater than `m` (3), it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes by adding one cube per move until 3 cubes are reached.
   - Expected Output: "Yes"
   - Program Output: "Yes"

The program's logic correctly handles these scenarios, and the outputs match the expected results.

### Conclusion:

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

**Correctness: True**
