Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The program only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and outputs "Yes" if true, otherwise "No". However, this logic is incorrect because Nikita can also remove cubes from the tower, which means the number of cubes can fluctuate up and down.

For example, consider the test case `n = 5` and `m = 3`:
- Nikita can start with 0 cubes.
- In the first move, he can add 1 cube (total: 1).
- In the second move, he can add 1 cube (total: 2).
- In the third move, he can add 1 cube (total: 3).
- In the fourth move, he can remove 1 cube (total: 2).
- In the fifth move, he can add 1 cube (total: 3).

Thus, it is possible to end up with 3 cubes after 5 moves, but the program would output "No" for this case because `n` (5) is greater than `m` (3) but the logic does not account for the possibility of removing cubes.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for cases where `n` is greater than `m`, but the sequence of adding and removing cubes can result in exactly `m` cubes.
