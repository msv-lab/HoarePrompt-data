### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotated version to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Program Breakdown

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Counting Good Subarrays:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a `Counter` for `b` (`b_freq`) to store the frequency of each element in `b`.
   - It also initializes a `Counter` for the first `m` elements of `a` (`window_freq`).
   - The number of matches between `window_freq` and `b_freq` is calculated by summing the minimum frequencies of elements that appear in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`.

3. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to iterate through `a` from index `0` to `n - m - 1`.
   - For each position, it checks if the current window has at least `k` matching elements with `b`. If so, it increments the `good_subarrays` counter.
   - It updates the `window_freq` by decrementing the count of the element that is sliding out of the window and incrementing the count of the new element that is sliding into the window.
   - The `matches` counter is updated accordingly to reflect the changes in the window.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program performs a final check on the last window to see if it is good and updates the `good_subarrays` counter if necessary.

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns the count of good subarrays for each test case, which is then printed.

#### Annotations Analysis

The annotations provided give a clear state of the program at key points, which helps in verifying the correctness of the logic:

- **Initialization:**
  - `b_freq` is correctly initialized to count the frequency of elements in `b`.
  - `window_freq` is initialized to count the frequency of the first `m` elements of `a`.
  - `matches` is correctly calculated as the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements that appear in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`.

- **Sliding Window:**
  - For each iteration, the program checks if `matches` is greater than or equal to `k` and increments `good_subarrays` if true.
  - The `window_freq` is updated by decrementing the count of the element sliding out and incrementing the count of the element sliding in.
  - The `matches` counter is updated correctly to reflect the changes in the window.

- **Final Check:**
  - After the loop, the program performs a final check on the last window to ensure it is considered.

#### Edge Cases

- **All Elements Match:**
  - If `k == m`, the program correctly checks if all elements in the window match `b`.

- **Single Match Required:**
  - If `k == 1`, the program correctly checks if at least one element in the window matches `b`.

- **Non-Unique Elements:**
  - The program handles non-unique elements in both `a` and `b` by using the `Counter` to keep track of frequencies.

#### Conclusion

The annotations confirm that the program correctly implements the sliding window technique and efficiently counts the number of good subarrays. The logic is sound, and the program handles all edge cases appropriately. The use of `Counter` ensures that the frequency updates are performed efficiently.
