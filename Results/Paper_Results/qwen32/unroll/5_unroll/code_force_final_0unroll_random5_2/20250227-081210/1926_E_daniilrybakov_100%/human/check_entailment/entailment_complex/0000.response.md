Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The algorithm iterates through the test cases, and for each test case, it calculates the `k`-th card laid down by Vladislav following the specified pattern. 

Here's a breakdown of the algorithm:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
3. It initializes `s` (the sum of counts of cards laid down so far) to 0 and `m` (the multiplier for the current sequence of cards) to 1.
4. It enters a while loop that continues until `n` becomes 0.
5. Inside the loop, it calculates `x`, which is the number of odd-numbered cards (or the number of cards in the current sequence) that can be laid down in the current iteration. This is computed as `(n + 1) // 2`.
6. It then divides `n` by 2 to move to the next sequence of cards (twice, thrice, etc. of odd numbers).
7. If `k` lies within the range `[s + 1, s + x]`, it breaks out of the loop because the `k`-th card is in the current sequence.
8. Otherwise, it adds `x` to `s` and multiplies `m` by 2 to move to the next sequence.
9. After the loop, it calculates the `k`-th card using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m` and prints it.

The formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m` correctly computes the `k`-th card by determining the position of `k` within the current sequence (adjusted by `s`), converting that position to the corresponding card number, and scaling it by `m` to account for the current sequence of cards (odd, twice odd, thrice odd, etc.).

Given that the program correctly follows the problem's logic and produces the expected output for the provided examples, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
