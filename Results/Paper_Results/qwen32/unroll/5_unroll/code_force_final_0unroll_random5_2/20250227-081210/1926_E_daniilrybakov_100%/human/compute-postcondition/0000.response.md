`The variable t is assigned the value of the integer input. The preconditions for n and k remain unchanged as they have not been assigned values yet. Therefore, the Output State is: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.`
Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
