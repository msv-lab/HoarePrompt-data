You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        m = 1
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k` where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. For each test case, it computes and prints a specific integer value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and see if it aligns with the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order:
1. First, all odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.
2. Then, cards that are twice an odd number, from smallest to largest.
3. Then, cards that are three times an odd number, from smallest to largest.
4. This pattern continues until all cards are laid down.

The task is to determine the k-th card in this sequence.

### Program Analysis

The given program uses a binary approach to determine the k-th card:
- It initializes `s` to 0 and `m` to 1.
- It then enters a loop where it calculates `x` as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd-numbered cards in the current set.
- It divides `n` by 2 to move to the next set of cards (twice an odd number, then three times, etc.).
- It checks if `k` falls within the range of the current set of cards. If it does, it breaks the loop.
- If `k` is not in the current set, it adds `x` to `s` and multiplies `m` by 2 to move to the next set.
- Finally, it calculates the k-th card using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.

### Validation

Let's validate the program with the given example:

#### Example Validation

For the first test case (n=7, k=1):
- Initially, `s=0`, `m=1`.
- `x = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4`, `n //= 2` → `n=3`.
- Since `1 <= 4`, the loop breaks.
- The k-th card is `(2 * (1 - 0) - 1) * 1 = 1`.

For the second test case (n=7, k=2):
- Initially, `s=0`, `m=1`.
- `x = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4`, `n //= 2` → `n=3`.
- Since `2 <= 4`, the loop breaks.
- The k-th card is `(2 * (2 - 0) - 1) * 1 = 3`.

This pattern continues correctly for all test cases in the example.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card in the sequence as described in the problem statement. It uses a binary approach to efficiently find the correct card without generating the entire sequence.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
