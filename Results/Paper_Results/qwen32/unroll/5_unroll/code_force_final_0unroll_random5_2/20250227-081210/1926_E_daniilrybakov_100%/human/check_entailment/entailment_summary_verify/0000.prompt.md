You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        m = 1
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k` where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. For each test case, it computes and prints a specific integer value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the code and see how it meets the requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` is the total number of cards, and `k` is the position of the card to find.

2. **Loop through test cases**:
   - For each test case, the code initializes `s` (a counter) to 0 and `m` (a multiplier) to 1.

3. **Determine the segment of the sequence**:
   - The code enters a while loop that continues until `n` becomes 0.
   - Inside the loop, `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, representing the number of odd-numbered cards in the current segment.
   - `n` is then divided by 2 to move to the next segment.
   - The code checks if `k` falls within the current segment by comparing `s < k <= s + x`. If `k` is within this range, the loop breaks.
   - If `k` is not in the current segment, `s` is incremented by `x`, and `m` is doubled to move to the next segment.

4. **Calculate the k-th card**:
   - Once the correct segment is identified, the k-th card is calculated using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.
   - This formula correctly identifies the position of the k-th card within the identified segment.

The code handles all edge cases, including:
- When `n` is 1 (only one card, which is always odd).
- When `k` is 1 (the first card laid down is always the smallest odd number).
- When `k` is equal to `n` (the last card laid down).

The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the code, and no potential cases where the code fails to meet the problem description have been identified. Therefore, the code is correct.
