To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how variables change during each iteration. The loop runs `t` times, and in each iteration, it processes a pair of integers `n` and `k`. Here's a breakdown of what happens in each iteration:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `m` is initialized to 1.

2. **Loop Body**:
   - The loop continues as long as `n` is not zero.
   - Inside the loop, `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - `n` is updated to `n // 2`.
   - If `s < k <= s + x`, the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, `s` is incremented by `x` and `m` is multiplied by 2.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - After exiting the loop, the output is calculated as `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.

4. **Output**:
   - The result of the output calculation is printed.

Since the loop runs `t` times, each time with different values of `n` and `k`, the final output state will be a series of `t` outputs, one for each iteration. The state of `t`, `n`, and `k` in the initial state will not change because they are only used as input for each iteration and are not modified within the loop.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9; the loop has executed t times, and for each iteration, the output (2 * (k - s) - 1) * m has been printed, where s and m are determined by the loop logic.**
