### Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of times the balance of '+' and '-' characters in the string goes negative and resetting it to zero each time it does. It then adds one if there is a positive balance left at the end. However, this approach does not correctly compute the minimum penalty as described in the problem statement.

The program calculates a value that seems to correlate with the number of times the balance goes negative and if there's a remaining positive balance, but it does not directly compute the total penalty as defined. The penalty is calculated based on the absolute value of the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length, which is not what the provided function does.

The given annotated program does not correctly implement the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. The provided function `func_1` does not account for the length of the subarrays and the absolute value of their sums, which are crucial for the correct calculation of the penalty.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
