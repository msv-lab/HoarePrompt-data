### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse occurs, given the periodicity of each sign and the requirement that signs must occur sequentially.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings (`data`).
   - It then processes this list to extract the number of test cases (`T`), the number of signs (`n`), and the periodicities (`a`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes `last_year` with the periodicity of the first sign (`a[0]`).
   - It then iterates over the remaining signs. For each sign `i` (starting from the second sign):
     - It calculates the year (`next_year`) in which the i-th sign will occur, given that the (i-1)-th sign occurred in `last_year`.
     - The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
     - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program writes the results to standard output, each on a new line.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program with the first example test case:

- **Input:**
  ```
  6
  3 2 4 5 9 18
  ```
- **Processing:**
  - First sign: `last_year = 3`
  - Second sign: `next_year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4`
  - Third sign: `next_year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8`
  - Fourth sign: `next_year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10`
  - Fifth sign: `next_year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18`
  - Sixth sign: `next_year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36`
- **Output:**
  ```
  36
  ```

The output matches the expected result, confirming that the program works correctly for this test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, based on the given periodicities and the sequential requirement. It has been verified with the provided example, and there are no apparent issues in the code.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**
