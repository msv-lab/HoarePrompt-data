To determine the output state, let's analyze the loop and how the variables change.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `T` is the number of test cases.
   - `results` is an empty list that will store the results of each test case.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each test case, `n` is the number of signs and `a` is the list of periodicities of the signs.
   - `last_year` is initialized to the first periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent periodicity `a[i]` (from `i = 1` to `n-1`):
     - `next_year` is calculated as the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.
     - `last_year` is updated to `next_year`.
   - After processing all periodicities for a test case, the final `last_year` is converted to a string and appended to `results`.

3. **Output State**:
   - `index` will be incremented by `1 + n` for each test case, where `n` is the number of signs for that test case.
   - `results` will contain the final `last_year` for each test case as a string.

Given the loop processes each test case and updates `results` accordingly, the final state of `results` will contain the final `last_year` for each test case.

Output State: **results is a list of strings representing the final last_year for each test case.**
