### Reasoning:

The provided program and the annotations align well with the problem description. Let's break down the logic and verify it step-by-step using the annotations and the example provided:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case based on the number of test cases `T`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` to `a[0]`, which is the first occurrence of the first sign.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula:
     ```python
     next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
     ```
     This formula correctly computes the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

3. **Verification with Example:**
   - **Input**: `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - **Processing**:
     - First sign: `last_year = 3`
     - Second sign: `next_year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4`
     - Third sign: `next_year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8`
     - Fourth sign: `next_year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10`
     - Fifth sign: `next_year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18`
     - Sixth sign: `next_year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36`
   - **Output**: `36` (matches the expected result)

4. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations confirm the state of the program at key points, showing that the logic is correctly implemented.
   - The annotations indicate that the `results` list is correctly populated with the final `last_year` for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately calculates the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs for each test case, and the annotations support this conclusion.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
