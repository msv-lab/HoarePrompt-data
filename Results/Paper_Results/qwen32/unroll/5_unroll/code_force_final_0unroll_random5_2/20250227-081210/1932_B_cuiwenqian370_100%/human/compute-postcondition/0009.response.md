Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The function returns the results for each test case.**
