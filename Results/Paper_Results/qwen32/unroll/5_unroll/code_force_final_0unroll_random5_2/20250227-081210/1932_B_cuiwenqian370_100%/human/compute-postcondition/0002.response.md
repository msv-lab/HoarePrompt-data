Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs; `input` is assigned the raw input data; `data` is a list of strings representing the split input data; `index` is 0.**

Natural language: The initial state remains unchanged as the only operation performed is the assignment of `index` to 0. No other variables are affected.
