To determine if the given Python program is correct, I will analyze the logic step by step to ensure it aligns with the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**:
   - The first line contains an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - The first line contains an integer `n` representing the number of signs.
     - The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the periodicities of the signs.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs, which marks the occurrence of the apocalypse.

3. **Logic**:
   - The first sign occurs in the first multiple of `a_1` that is `>= 1`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it occurs in the first multiple of `a_i` that is `>= (year of previous sign + 1)`.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case based on the number of test cases `T`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` to the first multiple of `a[0]` that is `>= 1`, which is simply `a[0]` since the first sign occurs in the first multiple of its periodicity.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula:
     ```python
     next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
     ```
     This formula finds the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is `>= (last_year + 1)`.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` and continues to the next sign.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints all results separated by newlines.

### Verification with Example
Let's verify the logic with the first test case from the example:
- **Input**: `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
- **Processing**:
  - First sign: `last_year = 3`
  - Second sign: `next_year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4`
  - Third sign: `next_year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8`
  - Fourth sign: `next_year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10`
  - Fifth sign: `next_year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18`
  - Sixth sign: `next_year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36`
- **Output**: `36` (matches the expected result)

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately calculates the year in which the `n`-th sign occurs for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
