The provided Python code snippet writes the contents of the list `results` to the standard output, with each element of the list on a new line, followed by an additional newline character at the end.

Given the initial state, the variable `results` is a list of strings. The code does not modify the `results` list itself; instead, it outputs its contents. Therefore, the state of `results` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`results` is a list of strings representing the final last_year for each test case. The contents of `results` have been written to the standard output, with each string on a new line and an additional newline character at the end.**
