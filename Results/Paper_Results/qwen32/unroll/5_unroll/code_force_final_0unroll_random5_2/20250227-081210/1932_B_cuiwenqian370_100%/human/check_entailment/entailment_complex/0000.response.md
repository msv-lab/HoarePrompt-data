### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the periodicity of each sign and the requirement that signs must occur sequentially.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the number of test cases `T` and iterates through each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n`.
   - It then reads the list of periodicities `a` for these signs.
   - The variable `last_year` is initialized to the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula:
     ```python
     next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
     ```
   - This formula ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous sign's occurrence year (`last_year + 1`), and it finds the next multiple of `a[i]` after `last_year + 1`.
   - The `last_year` is then updated to `next_year` for the next iteration.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the final `last_year` (the year in which the n-th sign occurs) is stored in the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints all results for the test cases.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the first example provided:

Input:
```
4
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 1 1 1 1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```

Output:
```
36
5
5
2012
```

- **First Test Case:**
  - `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - `last_year = 3`
  - `next_year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4`
  - `next_year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8`
  - `next_year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10`
  - `next_year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18`
  - `next_year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36`
  - **Output: 36**

- **Second Test Case:**
  - `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - `last_year = 1`
  - `next_year = (1 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 2`
  - `next_year = (2 + 1 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 3`
  - `next_year = (3 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 4`
  - `next_year = (4 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 5`
  - **Output: 5**

- **Third Test Case:**
  - `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - `last_year = 1`
  - `next_year = (1 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 1`
  - `next_year = (1 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 1`
  - `next_year = (1 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 1`
  - `next_year = (1 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 1`
  - **Output: 5**

- **Fourth Test Case:**
  - `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - `last_year = 50`
  - `next_year = (50 + 1 + 30 - 1) // 30 * 30 = 60`
  - `next_year = (60 + 1 + 711 - 1) // 711 * 711 = 711`
  - `next_year = (711 + 1 + 200 - 1) // 200 * 200 = 900`
  - `next_year = (900 + 1 + 503 - 1) // 503 * 503 = 1006`
  - `next_year = (1006 + 1 + 1006 - 1) // 1006 * 1006 = 2012`
  - **Output: 2012**

The program correctly computes the year for the n-th sign in each test case, matching the provided example output.
