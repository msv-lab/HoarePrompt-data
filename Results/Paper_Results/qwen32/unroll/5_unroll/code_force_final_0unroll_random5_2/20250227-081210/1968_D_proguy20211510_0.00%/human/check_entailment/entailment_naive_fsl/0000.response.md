Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program makes incorrect assumptions and does not account for all possible scenarios. Here are a few issues identified:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Maximum Scores**:
   - The program assumes that the player who reaches the maximum value in the array `a` will always win. However, this is not necessarily true. Players can make strategic moves to maximize their scores, and the game involves multiple turns. The program does not simulate the game accurately for all possible moves and positions.

2. **Incorrect Simulation of Moves**:
   - The program only simulates the first `k` moves and then assumes the rest of the moves will be to the position with the maximum value in `a`. This is not correct because the players can choose to stay in their current position or move to `p_x` on each turn. The program does not explore all possible move sequences.

3. **Inefficient Calculation of Scores**:
   - The program calculates the scores by appending to lists `b` and `s` and then summing them up. This is not efficient and can lead to incorrect results if the game involves long cycles or if the players make different moves that affect the scores differently.

4. **Handling of Cycles**:
   - The problem involves permutations, which can form cycles. The program does not handle cycles correctly. If both players are in cycles, the program does not account for the possibility of both players being in the same cycle and the scores accumulating differently over time.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the incorrectness:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 1 2
3 4 1 2
1 1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
- Both players start at positions with the same score value of `1`.
- On the first turn, both players can either stay or move. If they both stay, their scores remain `1`.
- On the second turn, they can again either stay or move. If they both stay, their scores remain `1`.
- After two turns, both players have the same score of `2`, resulting in a draw.

The provided program would incorrectly output "Bodya" or "Sasha" instead of "Draw" due to its incorrect handling of the game mechanics and score calculations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least this case, and the correctness is False.
