You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and two lists: a permutation `p` and an array `a`. For each test case, it determines the winner between "Bodya" and "Sasha" based on the values in `a` and the permutation `p`, or declares a "Draw" if the outcome is tied. The function outputs "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The program attempts to determine the winner of a game involving two players, Bodya and Sasha, who move through a permutation array and collect scores based on an associated array. The game lasts for `k` turns, and on each turn, each player can either stay in their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation array. The player with the higher score after `k` turns wins.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` (the length of the permutation, the number of turns, Bodya's starting position, and Sasha's starting position).
   - It then reads the permutation array `p` and the score array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program first checks if the scores at the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are both equal to the maximum score in the `a` array. If so, it outputs "Draw".
   - If the score at Bodya's starting position is the maximum, it outputs "Bodya".
   - If the score at Sasha's starting position is the maximum, it outputs "Sasha".

3. **Simulation of the Game:**
   - The program simulates the game for up to `k` turns.
   - It keeps track of the scores for Bodya and Sasha in the lists `b` and `s`, respectively.
   - If either player reaches the maximum score, they stay in that position for the remaining turns.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative scores for Bodya and Sasha up to the point where they reach the maximum score or the end of `k` turns.
   - It then calculates the potential scores for the remaining turns if the players stay in their current positions.

5. **Determine the Winner:**
   - The program compares the maximum potential scores for Bodya and Sasha and outputs the winner or "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Logic Flaw in Simulation:**
  - The program does not correctly handle the scenario where both players reach the maximum score at different times. It should consider the scores up to the point where the maximum score is reached and then calculate the remaining scores if they stay in the maximum score position.
  - The logic for calculating the remaining scores after reaching the maximum score is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that once a player reaches the maximum score, they will stay in that position for the remaining turns, which may not be the optimal strategy for the other player.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly simulate the game and determine the winner in all scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
