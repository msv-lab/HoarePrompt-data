Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and two lists: a permutation `p` and an array `a`. For each test case, it determines the winner between "Bodya" and "Sasha" based on the values in `a` and the permutation `p`, or declares a "Draw" if the outcome is tied. The function outputs "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" for each test case.**
