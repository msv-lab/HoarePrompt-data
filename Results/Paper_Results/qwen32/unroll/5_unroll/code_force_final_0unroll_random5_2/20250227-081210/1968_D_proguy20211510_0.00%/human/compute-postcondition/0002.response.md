The provided code snippet only initializes a variable `alpha` with the string of lowercase English letters. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`) are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect this initialization while keeping all other variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each of the t test cases, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` are positive integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; The permutation `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`, inclusive; The array `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, inclusive; The sum of values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `YES` is the string 'YES'; `NO` is the string 'NO'; `MOD` is 1000000007; `alpha` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**
