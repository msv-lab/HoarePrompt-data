### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of determining the winner of the "Permutation game" between Bodya and Sasha. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`. It also reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - It first checks if the maximum element in array `a` is at both `P_B` and `P_S`. If so, it declares a "Draw".
   - If the maximum element is at `P_B`, it declares "Bodya" as the winner.
   - If the maximum element is at `P_S`, it declares "Sasha" as the winner.

3. **Game Simulation**:
   - It initializes two lists `b` and `s` to keep track of the scores of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It uses two flags `foundb` and `founds` to check if either player has reached the maximum element.
   - For each turn up to `k`, it updates the scores and positions of Bodya and Sasha. If either player reaches the position with the maximum element, it sets the respective flag to `True` and continues to add the maximum element to the scores for the remaining turns.

4. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - It calculates the prefix sums of the scores for both players in `preb` and `pres`.

5. **Total Possible Scores Calculation**:
   - It calculates the total possible scores for both players for each turn up to `k` in `ptsb` and `ptss`.

6. **Determine Winner**:
   - It finds the maximum possible score for both players and compares them to determine the winner.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program handles the case where the maximum element is at the starting positions of both players correctly.
- It correctly simulates the game for up to `k` turns and keeps track of the scores.
- It calculates the total possible scores correctly by adding the maximum element for the remaining turns once a player reaches the maximum element.
- It compares the maximum possible scores correctly to determine the winner.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the given problem description and constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
