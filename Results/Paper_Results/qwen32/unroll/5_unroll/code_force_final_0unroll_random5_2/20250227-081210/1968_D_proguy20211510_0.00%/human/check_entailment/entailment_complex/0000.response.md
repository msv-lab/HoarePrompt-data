### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the winner of a game based on the rules described. Here's a breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Parsing Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`, converts them to integers, and reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Immediate Decision Based on Maximum Value:**
   - The program first checks if the values at `pb` and `ps` in array `a` are equal to the maximum value in `a`.
     - If both are equal to the maximum value, it prints "Draw".
     - If only Bodya's position has the maximum value, it prints "Bodya".
     - If only Sasha's position has the maximum value, it prints "Sasha".

3. **Simulating the Game:**
   - If the immediate decision is not reached, the program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - It tracks the scores of Bodya and Sasha in lists `b` and `s`, respectively.
   - If either player reaches the maximum value in the array `a`, they continue to collect the maximum value for the remaining turns.
   - The program correctly updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.

4. **Calculating Scores:**
   - It calculates the prefix sums of the scores for both players.
   - It calculates the potential scores for both players if they continue to collect the last collected value for the remaining turns.
   - It determines the maximum potential score for both players.

5. **Determining the Winner:**
   - Based on the maximum potential scores, it prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, or "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the logic for the game, including the immediate decision based on the maximum value and the simulation of the game for `k` turns.
- It handles edge cases such as when both players start at the position with the maximum value, or when one player reaches the maximum value during the game.
- The program efficiently calculates and compares the scores of both players.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the provided rules and input constraints.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
