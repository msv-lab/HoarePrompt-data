The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the values of `array`, `data`, `t`, or `index`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `results` list.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer a_i in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings, where each string is a representation of an integer from the input; `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
