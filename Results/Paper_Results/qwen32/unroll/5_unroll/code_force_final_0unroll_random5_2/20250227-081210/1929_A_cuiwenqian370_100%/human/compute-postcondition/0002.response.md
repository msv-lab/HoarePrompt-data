The code snippet converts the first element of the `data` list, which is a string, into an integer and assigns it to the variable `t`. The `array` and the remaining elements of `data` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer a_i in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings, where each string is a representation of an integer from the input; `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`.**
