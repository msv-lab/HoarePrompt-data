The code snippet provided assigns the value `1` to the variable `index`. The other variables `array`, `data`, and `t` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer a_i in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings, where each string is a representation of an integer from the input; `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`; `index` is 1.**
