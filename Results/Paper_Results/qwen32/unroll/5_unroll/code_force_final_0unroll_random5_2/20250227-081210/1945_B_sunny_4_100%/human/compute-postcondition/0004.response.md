The function `func` accepts an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each of the `t` test cases, the function receives three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` such that `1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18`. The functionality of the function is to process these inputs and return a result for each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information. Given the constraints and relationships, we can infer the following:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
