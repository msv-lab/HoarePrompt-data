Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch, and fireworks are launched at intervals of `a` and `b` minutes by two separate installations.

### Code Analysis
The provided code calculates `m // a + m // b + 2` for each test case. Let's break down what this calculation represents:
- `m // a` gives the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the first `m` minutes.
- `m // b` gives the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the first `m` minutes.
- Adding `2` is not justified by the problem description and seems arbitrary.

### Correct Approach
To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to consider:
1. The periodicity of fireworks launches (LCM of `a` and `b`).
2. The visibility intervals of fireworks launched within one LCM period.
3. Overlapping intervals of visibility.

### Why the Provided Code is Incorrect
The provided code does not account for the overlap of visibility intervals or the periodicity of fireworks launches. It simply sums the number of fireworks launched within `m` minutes by each installation and adds `2`, which does not yield the correct result.

### Correct Solution
A correct solution would involve:
1. Calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
2. Determining the number of fireworks launched by each installation within one LCM period.
3. Calculating the number of overlapping visibility intervals.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the provided code is incorrect. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaws in the code.

**Final: False**
