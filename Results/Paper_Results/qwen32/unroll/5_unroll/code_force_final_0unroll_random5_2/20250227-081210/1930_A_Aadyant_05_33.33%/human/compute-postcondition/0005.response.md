The provided code snippet contains a loop that iterates over the elements in the list `out` and prints each element. However, the loop does not modify the list `out` or the variables `t` and `num`. Therefore, the state of `t` and `num` remains unchanged, and the list `out` is only used for printing its contents.

Since the loop does not change the state of the variables `t` and `num`, and the list `out` is only used for printing, the output state will be the same as the initial state with respect to `t` and `num`. The list `out` will still contain the same sums of the selected elements from each iteration, but it will not be altered by the loop.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `num` is a string containing the input line; `out` is a list containing the sums of the selected elements from each iteration.**
