### Reasoning:
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the score by performing `n` moves, where each move consists of picking two integers, adding the smaller one to the score, and removing both integers from the list.
2. **Optimal Strategy**: To maximize the score, it's optimal to pair the smallest numbers together. This way, the smaller number in each pair contributes to the score, and the larger numbers are used up efficiently.

#### Solution Breakdown:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of pairs) and then reads `2n` integers.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The integers are split into a list, converted to integers, and sorted in ascending order.
   - The solution then iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first (i.e., `list1[0]`, `list1[2]`, `list1[4]`, etc.). These elements are the smaller ones in each pair if the list is sorted.
   - These elements are added to a new list `list2`.
   - The sum of `list2` is calculated and appended to the `out` list, which stores the results for each test case.
   
3. **Output**:
   - The results stored in `out` are printed one by one.

#### Analysis:
- **Sorting**: Sorting the list ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together, which aligns with the optimal strategy.
- **Selecting Elements**: By selecting every second element from the sorted list, the solution effectively picks the smaller number from each pair.
- **Summing Up**: Summing the selected elements gives the maximum possible score.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the optimal strategy for the problem. It sorts the list of integers, selects the smaller numbers from each pair, and sums them up to achieve the maximum score.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
