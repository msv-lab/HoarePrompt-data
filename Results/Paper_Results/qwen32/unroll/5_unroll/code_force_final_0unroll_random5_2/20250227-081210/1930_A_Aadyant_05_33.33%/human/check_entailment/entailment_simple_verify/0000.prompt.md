You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

    num = input()

        a = int(a)
        b = input('')
        list1 = b.split()
        list1.sort()
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        out.append(sum(list2))
        del list1[:]
        del list2[:]
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program is supposed to handle multiple test cases where each test case involves a list of `2n` integers. The goal is to maximize the score by performing `n` moves, where each move consists of selecting two integers from the list, adding the minimum of the two to the score, and removing them from the list.

Here is the provided program:
```python
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        list1 = []
        a = input()
        a = int(a)
        b = input('')
        list1 = b.split()
        list1.sort()
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        out.append(sum(list2))
        del list1[:]
        del list2[:]
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)
```

### Key Points to Check

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of integers for each test case.
3. **Selection of Pairs**: The program selects pairs of integers by taking every second element from the sorted list.
4. **Score Calculation**: The program calculates the score by summing the selected integers.

### Verification

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases and processing each test case.
2. **Sorting**: Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are paired first, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
3. **Selection of Pairs**: By selecting every second element from the sorted list, the program ensures that the minimum of each pair is added to the score.
4. **Score Calculation**: The program correctly sums the selected integers to compute the final score.

### Edge Cases

1. **Single Test Case**: The program handles a single test case correctly.
2. **Multiple Test Cases**: The program processes multiple test cases correctly.
3. **Minimum and Maximum Values**: The program handles minimum and maximum values within the specified constraints.
4. **All Identical Elements**: The program handles cases where all elements are identical.
5. **Mixed Elements**: The program handles cases with mixed values.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the score by always selecting the smallest possible elements in each pair. It handles all the edge cases and adheres to the problem description.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly sorts the list of integers and selects the smallest elements in each pair to maximize the score. It handles multiple test cases and various edge cases as described in the problem statement.
