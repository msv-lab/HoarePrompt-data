You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = -1
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        cnt = []
        for k in M.keys():
            if M[k] == 1:
                cnt.append(k)
        if len(cnt) >= 2:
            cur = cnt[1]
        print(cur)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is in the range 0 to `n-1`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer `cur` based on the sorted list and the count of unique elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c` (Alice's turn) or simply removing them from `a` (Bob's turn). The goal is to find the MEX of `c` after all elements have been removed from `a`, assuming both players play optimally.

### Optimal Strategy
- **Alice's Goal:** Maximize the MEX of `c`.
- **Bob's Goal:** Minimize the MEX of `c`.

### Key Observations
1. **MEX Calculation:** The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Turn Order:** Alice starts, so she can influence the MEX by strategically choosing numbers.
3. **Count of Numbers:** The optimal strategy involves keeping track of how many times each number appears in `a` and making sure that the smallest missing number is maximized by Alice's choices.

### Program Analysis
The program provided attempts to determine the final MEX after the game. Let's break down its logic:

1. **Input Reading:** It reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers.
2. **Sorting:** It sorts the list `N` of integers.
3. **Tracking Numbers:** It initializes a dictionary `M` to keep track of the count of each number in `N`.
4. **Finding MEX:** It iterates through the sorted list and updates the current MEX (`cur`) based on the counts of numbers.
5. **Adjusting MEX:** If the sum of counts in `M` equals `S` (the length of `N`), it increments `cur` by 1.
6. **Handling Single Occurrences:** It creates a list `cnt` of numbers that appear exactly once in `N`. If there are at least two such numbers, it sets `cur` to the second smallest number in `cnt`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation:** The logic for calculating MEX is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the case where numbers are not consecutive or where there are gaps in the sequence of numbers.
2. **Optimal Strategy Ignored:** The program does not account for the optimal moves by both players. It simply counts occurrences and tries to find the MEX, which does not consider the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob.
3. **Handling of Counts:** The program does not handle the situation where numbers are chosen optimally by Alice to maximize the MEX.

### Conclusion
Given the above points, the provided program does not correctly compute the MEX after the game, especially considering the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
