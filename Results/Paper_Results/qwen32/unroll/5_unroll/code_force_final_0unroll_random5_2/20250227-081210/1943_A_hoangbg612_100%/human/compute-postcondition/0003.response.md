To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's analyze the provided code and how it processes each test case.

### Code Analysis

1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases.
2. **Inner Processing**:
    - `S` is read as an integer.
    - `N` is read as a list of integers and sorted.
    - `cur` is initialized to `-1`.
    - A dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences of each number in `N`.
    - The loop iterates over the sorted list `N`:
        - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`:
            - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1 and the loop breaks.
            - Otherwise, `cur` is set to `num` and `num` is added to the dictionary `M` with a count of 1.
        - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, the count of `cur` in `M` is incremented by 1.
    - After the loop, if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`, `cur` is incremented by 1.
    - `cnt` is a list of keys from `M` where the value is 1.
    - If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `cur` is set to the second element of `cnt`.
    - The value of `cur` is printed.

### Output State

The output for each test case is the value of `cur` after the inner processing is complete. The value of `cur` is determined based on the conditions mentioned above.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's consider a simple example to understand the output state:

- **Input**: `T = 2`
    - **Test Case 1**:
        - `S = 5`
        - `N = [0, 1, 2, 2, 3]`
    - **Test Case 2**:
        - `S = 4`
        - `N = [0, 0, 1, 2]`

#### Test Case 1:
- `N` is sorted: `[0, 1, 2, 2, 3]`
- `cur` starts at `-1`.
- Iteration:
    - `num = 0`: `cur` becomes `0`, `M = {0: 1}`
    - `num = 1`: `cur` becomes `1`, `M = {0: 1, 1: 1}`
    - `num = 2`: `cur` becomes `2`, `M = {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}`
    - `num = 2`: `M[2]` becomes `2`
    - `num = 3`: `cur` becomes `3`, `M = {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1}`
- Sum of counts in `M` is `5`, which equals `S`, so `cur` becomes `4`.
- `cnt = [0, 1, 3]` (keys with count `1`).
- Since `len(cnt) >= 2`, `cur` becomes `1`.
- **Output for Test Case 1**: `1`

#### Test Case 2:
- `N` is sorted: `[0, 0, 1, 2]`
- `cur` starts at `-1`.
- Iteration:
    - `num = 0`: `cur` becomes `0`, `M = {0: 1}`
    - `num = 0`: `M[0]` becomes `2`
    - `num = 1`: `cur` becomes `1`, `M = {0: 2, 1: 1}`
    - `num = 2`: `cur` becomes `2`, `M = {0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 1}`
- Sum of counts in `M` is `4`, which equals `S`, so `cur` becomes `3`.
- `cnt = [1, 2]` (keys with count `1`).
- Since `len(cnt) >= 2`, `cur` becomes `2`.
- **Output for Test Case 2**: `2`

### Final Output State

After processing all test cases, the output state is the final value of `cur` for each test case.

**Output State: **The value of `cur` after processing each test case is printed sequentially.**

Since the problem asks for a single output state, we can represent it in a generic format:

**Output State: **The value of `cur` for each test case is printed sequentially.**

If you have specific input values, the exact output can be derived by running the code with those inputs.
