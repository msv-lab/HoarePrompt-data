Output State: **T is an input integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `T` is assigned the value of the input integer, which is the number of test cases. The conditions and constraints for `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they are specific to each test case and have not been altered by this code snippet.
