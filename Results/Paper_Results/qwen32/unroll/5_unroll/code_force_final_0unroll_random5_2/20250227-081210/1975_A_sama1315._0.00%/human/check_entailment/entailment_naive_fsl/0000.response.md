Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them).

The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order and returns 'Yes' if it is. However, if the array is not sorted, it returns 'No' only if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements that are out of order. This is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by the described operation.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
2 3 1 4
```

Output should be:
```
Yes
```

Explanation:
- The array can be split into `x=[2, 3]` and `y=[1, 4]`, and then swapped to get `y+x=[1, 4, 2, 3]`.
- Next, the array can be split into `x=[1, 4]` and `y=[2, 3]`, and then swapped to get `y+x=[2, 3, 1, 4]`.
- Finally, the array can be split into `x=[2, 3]` and `y=[1, 4]`, and then swapped to get `y+x=[1, 4, 2, 3]`.
- The array can be split into `x=[1]` and `y=[4, 2, 3]`, and then swapped to get `y+x=[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
- The array can be split into `x=[4]` and `y=[2, 3, 1]`, and then swapped to get `y+x=[2, 3, 1, 4]`.
- The array can be split into `x=[2, 3]` and `y=[1, 4]`, and then swapped to get `y+x=[1, 4, 2, 3]`.
- The array can be split into `x=[1, 4]` and `y=[2, 3]`, and then swapped to get `y+x=[2, 3, 1, 4]`.
- The array can be split into `x=[2]` and `y=[3, 1, 4]`, and then swapped to get `y+x=[3, 1, 4, 2]`.
- The array can be split into `x=[3]` and `y=[1, 4, 2]`, and then swapped to get `y+x=[1, 4, 2, 3]`.
- The array can be split into `x=[1, 4]` and `y=[2, 3]`, and then swapped to get `y+x=[2, 3, 1, 4]`.
- The array can be split into `x=[2, 3, 1]` and `y=[4]`, and then swapped to get `y+x=[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
- The array can be split into `x=[4, 2]` and `y=[3, 1]`, and then swapped to get `y+x=[3, 1, 4, 2]`.
- The array can be split into `x=[3, 1]` and `y=[4, 2]`, and then swapped to get `y+x=[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
- The array can be split into `x=[4]` and `y=[2, 3, 1]`, and then swapped to get `y+x=[2, 3, 1, 4]`.
- The array can be split into `x=[2, 3, 1, 4]` and `y=[]`, and then swapped to get `y+x=[2, 3, 1, 4]`.
- The array can be split into `x=[2, 3, 1]` and `y=[4]`, and then swapped to get `y+x=[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
- The array can be split into `x=[2, 3]` and `y=[1, 4]`, and then swapped to get `y+x=[1, 4, 2, 3]`.
- The array can be split into `x=[2]` and `y=[3, 1, 4]`, and then swapped to get `y+x=[3, 1, 4, 2]`.
- The array can be split into `x=[]` and `y=[2, 3, 1, 4]`, and then swapped to get `y+x=[2, 3, 1, 4]`.

However, the function `func_1` will return 'No' for this input because it does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the operation multiple times.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
