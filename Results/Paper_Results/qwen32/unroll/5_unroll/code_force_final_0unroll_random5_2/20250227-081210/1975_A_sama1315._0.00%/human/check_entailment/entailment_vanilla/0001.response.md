Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where we split the array into a prefix and a suffix and swap them. 

### Key Observations
1. **Non-Decreasing Check**: If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, the answer is "Yes".
2. **Splitting and Swapping**: The operation of splitting and swapping can be visualized as rotating the array. If we can rotate the array to achieve a non-decreasing order, then the answer is "Yes".

### Correctness of the Program

#### Function `func_1(arr)`
This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function with a generator expression. If all elements are in non-decreasing order, it returns "Yes". Otherwise, it checks if there is any element that is greater than the next one using the `any` function. If such an element exists, it returns "No". If neither condition is met (which should not happen given the problem constraints), it returns "Yes" as a fallback.

#### Function `func_2()`
This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and uses `func_1` to determine the result for each test case. It correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the results in the required format.

### Flaw in the Program
The primary issue with the given program is in the logic of `func_1`. The function only checks if the array is already sorted or not. However, it does not account for the possibility of rotating the array to achieve a sorted order. The problem allows for multiple rotations, and the program should check if the array can be rotated to become non-decreasing.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the array can be split into two parts such that when swapped, the resulting array is sorted. This can be achieved by finding the point in the array where the order breaks and checking if the array can be rotated to become sorted.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by rotating it. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not sufficient for the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
