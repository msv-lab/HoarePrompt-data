The provided code snippet only initializes the variable `index` to 0. It does not affect the values of `arr`, `input`, or `data`. Therefore, the state of `arr` remains a list of `n` positive integers, `input` remains `sys.stdin.read`, and `data` remains a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `input` is `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 0.**
