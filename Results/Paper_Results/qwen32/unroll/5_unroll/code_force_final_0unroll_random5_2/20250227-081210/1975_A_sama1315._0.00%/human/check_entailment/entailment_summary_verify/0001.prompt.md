You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of positive integers. For each test case, it computes the result using `func_1` and prints the results, each on a new line.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where we split the array into a prefix and a suffix and swap them. 

### Key Observations
1. **Non-Decreasing Check**: If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, the answer is "Yes".
2. **Splitting and Swapping**: The operation of splitting and swapping can be visualized as rotating the array. If we can rotate the array to achieve a non-decreasing order, then the answer is "Yes".

### Correctness of the Program

#### Function `func_1(arr)`
This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function with a generator expression. If all elements are in non-decreasing order, it returns "Yes". Otherwise, it checks if there is any element that is greater than the next one using the `any` function. If such an element exists, it returns "No". If neither condition is met (which should not happen given the problem constraints), it returns "Yes" as a fallback.

#### Function `func_2()`
This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and uses `func_1` to determine the result for each test case. It correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the results in the required format.

### Flaw in the Program
The primary issue with the given program is in the logic of `func_1`. The function only checks if the array is already sorted or not. However, it does not account for the possibility of rotating the array to achieve a sorted order. The problem allows for multiple rotations, and the program should check if the array can be rotated to become non-decreasing.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the array can be split into two parts such that when swapped, the resulting array is sorted. This can be achieved by finding the point in the array where the order breaks and checking if the array can be rotated to become sorted.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by rotating it. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not sufficient for the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
