t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. Each of the t test cases consists of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 100, followed by n lines where each line contains two integers a and x, where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and all pairs (a, x) are distinct.
