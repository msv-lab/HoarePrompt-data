The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. This integer represents the number of test cases (`t`). The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are part of the initial state and are not directly affected by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `loop` is an integer equal to `t`; Each of the `t` test cases consists of an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 100, followed by `n` lines where each line contains two integers `a` and `x`, where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and all pairs (a, x) are distinct.**
