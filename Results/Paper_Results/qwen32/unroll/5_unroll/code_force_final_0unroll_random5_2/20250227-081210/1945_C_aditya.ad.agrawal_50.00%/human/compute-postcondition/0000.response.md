Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; Each test case consists of an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string a of length n consisting only of 0s and 1s, where a_j = 0 if the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side of the street, and a_j = 1 if the resident wants to live on the right side. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 2·10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**

In simple terms: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the number of test cases. All other conditions and variables from the initial state remain unchanged.
