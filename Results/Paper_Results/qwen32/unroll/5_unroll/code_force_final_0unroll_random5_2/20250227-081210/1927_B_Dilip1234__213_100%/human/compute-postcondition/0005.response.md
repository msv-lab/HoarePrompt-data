Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the length of the string to be constructed, and `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is between 0 and `n-1`. The function returns a string `s` of length `n` constructed based on the values in `a`. The string `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z', and the frequency of each character in `s` is determined by the values in `a`.**
