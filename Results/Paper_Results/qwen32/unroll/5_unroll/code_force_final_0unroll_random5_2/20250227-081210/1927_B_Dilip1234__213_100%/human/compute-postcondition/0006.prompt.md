You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. It is guaranteed that for the given trace, there exists a suitable string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.
def func_1(n, a):
    s = ''
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1
                break
        
    #State: `s` is a string of length `n` constructed based on the values in `a` and `char_count` reflects the frequency of each character in `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
    return s
    #The program returns the string `s` of length `n` constructed based on the values in `a` and `char_count` reflects the frequency of each character in `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the length of the string to be constructed, and `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is between 0 and `n-1`. The function returns a string `s` of length `n` constructed based on the values in `a`. The string `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z', and the frequency of each character in `s` is determined by the values in `a`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the string `s` of length `n` constructed based on the values in `a` and `char_count` reflects the frequency of each character in `s`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
