Reasoning:
The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description specifies a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` that scans subdirectories within the current directory, checks if their names fall within a specified range, and then generates specific files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in those directories. 

However, the given program defines a function `func_1` that reads input values and performs a completely different task: it checks conditions on strings based on the count of '1's in those strings and prints 'YES' or 'NO'. This function does not interact with the file system or generate any files, which are the core functionalities described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect for the problem described.

Correctness: **False**
