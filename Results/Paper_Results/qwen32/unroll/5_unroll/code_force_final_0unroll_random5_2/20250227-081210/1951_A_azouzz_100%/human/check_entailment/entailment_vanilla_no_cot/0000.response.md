Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description requires a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` that scans subfolders within the current directory, checks if the folder names are within a specified numeric range, and then generates two files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each HTML file found in those folders. 

The given program instead defines a function `func_1()` that reads input values, counts the occurrences of '1' in a string, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. This is unrelated to the problem described.
