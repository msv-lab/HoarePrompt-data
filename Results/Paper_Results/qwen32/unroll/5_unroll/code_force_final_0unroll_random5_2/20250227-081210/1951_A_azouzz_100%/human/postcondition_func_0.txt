The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s`. It then determines if the string `s` meets specific conditions related to the count of '1's in the string and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on these conditions. The function does not accept parameters `start` and `end` as described in the annotations, and it does not return any value; instead, it outputs strings to the console.
