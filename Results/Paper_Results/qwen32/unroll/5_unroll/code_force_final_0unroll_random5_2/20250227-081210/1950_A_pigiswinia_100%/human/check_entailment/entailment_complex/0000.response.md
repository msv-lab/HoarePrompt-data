Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or neither based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The program starts by reading the integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It then checks the conditions:
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
   - If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NONE".
4. The program handles all possible scenarios for the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as outlined in the problem description.

The program correctly processes each test case independently and prints the appropriate result for each case. The logic and implementation match the problem requirements exactly.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
