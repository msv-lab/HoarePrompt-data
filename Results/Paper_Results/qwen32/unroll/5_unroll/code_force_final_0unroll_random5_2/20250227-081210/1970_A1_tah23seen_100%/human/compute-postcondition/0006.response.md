The code `d.pop(n)` removes the key `n` from the dictionary `d`. Since `d[n]` is 0, removing this key-value pair means that the dictionary `d` no longer contains the key `n`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n-1`, where `d[i]` represents the depth of nested parentheses at position `i`.**
