Output State: **The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the program reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `nums`. It calculates a value `curr` by iterating through `nums` and adding the difference between each non-zero element and the last element of `nums`. If `curr` is 0 after processing all test cases, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The specific values of `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr` are not preserved across test cases and are determined anew for each iteration of the outer loop.**
