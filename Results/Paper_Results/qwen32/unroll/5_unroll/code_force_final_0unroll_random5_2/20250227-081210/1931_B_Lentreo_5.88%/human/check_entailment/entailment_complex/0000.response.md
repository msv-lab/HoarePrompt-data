### Reasoning:
The given program is attempting to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. However, the logic implemented in the program is incorrect. The program is calculating a value `curr` by summing up the differences between each non-zero element and the last element of the list `nums`. This approach does not correctly determine if the water can be evenly distributed among all containers.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if we can redistribute the water such that each container has the same amount, which is the total sum of water divided by the number of containers. The key is to ensure that at each step, we can move water from left to right (i.e., from a smaller index to a larger index) to achieve this equal distribution.

Here's a correct approach:
1. Calculate the target amount of water each container should have, which is the total sum of water divided by `n`.
2. Track the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target amount as we iterate through the containers.
3. If at any point the cumulative difference is negative, it means we don't have enough water to meet the target for the current container, and we should return "NO".
4. If we can iterate through all containers without a negative cumulative difference, then it is possible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount, and we should return "YES".

Given the current implementation, it does not follow this logic and instead calculates a sum of differences which does not accurately reflect the feasibility of redistributing the water as required.
