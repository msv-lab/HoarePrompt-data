Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic in the program is flawed.

Here's a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. The program calculates `curr` by summing the differences between each element and the last element of the list `nums`. However, this does not correctly account for the possibility of redistributing water according to the rules provided in the problem.

2. The problem allows pouring water from any i-th container to any j-th container where i < j, any number of times. The correct approach would involve checking if, starting from the left, the cumulative sum of water can be made equal to the target amount (which is the total sum of water divided by `n`) at each step.

3. The program should check if it is possible to make the cumulative sum of water up to each container equal to the target amount by pouring water from previous containers to the current one, if necessary.

A correct approach would involve iterating through the list and maintaining a running total of water, checking if it is possible to distribute the water such that each container ends up with the same amount.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total = sum(nums)
        target = total // n
        current = 0
        possible = True
        for i in range(n):
            current += nums[i]
            if current < target * (i + 1):
                possible = False
                break
        print('YES' if possible else 'NO')

func()
```

This corrected program checks if it is possible to distribute the water such that each container ends up with the same amount by ensuring that the cumulative sum of water up to each container is at least the target amount times the number of containers considered so far.
