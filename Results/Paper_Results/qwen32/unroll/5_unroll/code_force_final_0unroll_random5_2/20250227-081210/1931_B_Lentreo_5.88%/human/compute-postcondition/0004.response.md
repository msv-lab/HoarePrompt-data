Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of containers and the amounts of water in those containers. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to redistribute the water such that all containers have the same amount by only moving water from non-zero containers to the last container. It prints 'YES' if such redistribution is possible, otherwise 'NO'.**
