### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining whether it's possible to redistribute water among containers such that all containers have the same amount of water. The only allowed operation is pouring water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`. The total amount of water is guaranteed to be divisible by the number of containers.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program processes each test case as follows:
1. It reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
2. It initializes `last` to the last element of `nums`.
3. It calculates `curr` by summing the differences between each element and `last` if the element is not zero.
4. It checks if `curr` is zero and prints "YES" if it is, otherwise "NO".

#### Function Summary:
The function summary suggests that the program checks if it's possible to redistribute water such that all containers have the same amount by only moving water from non-zero containers to the last container. This is not an accurate description of the problem's requirements, which allow moving water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem:
1. Calculate the target amount of water each container should have, which is the total sum of water divided by the number of containers.
2. Traverse the list of containers and maintain a running total of the water. At each step, check if the running total is equal to the expected total for the number of containers processed so far. If at any point it is not possible to balance, return "NO". If we can balance up to the last container, return "YES".

#### Evaluation:
The provided program does not follow the correct approach. The logic of summing differences between each element and the last element does not ensure that the water can be balanced across all containers as required by the problem statement. The function summary also misrepresents the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the containers can be balanced. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Final: False**
