You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of containers and the amounts of water in those containers. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to redistribute the water such that all containers have the same amount by only moving water from non-zero containers to the last container. It prints 'YES' if such redistribution is possible, otherwise 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The logic in the program is flawed and does not account for the correct conditions to redistribute the water as described.

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

The program calculates a `curr` value by iterating through the list `nums` and adding the difference between each element and the last element (`last`) to `curr`, but only if the element is not zero. It then checks if `curr` is zero to determine if the redistribution is possible.

This logic is incorrect because it does not properly check the conditions for redistributing water. The correct approach would involve checking if the cumulative sum of water up to each point can be balanced with the average amount of water each container should have.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
```

Explanation of the example:
- The sum of water is 6, and there are 3 containers, so each container should have 2 units of water.
- The program calculates `curr` as follows:
  - `last = 3`
  - `curr = (1 - 3) + (2 - 3) + (3 - 3) = -2 - 1 + 0 = -3`
  - Since `curr` is not zero, the program incorrectly outputs "NO", but the correct answer should be "NO" because it is not possible to redistribute the water to make each container have exactly 2 units of water.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case and potentially others, leading to the conclusion that `Correctness: False`.
