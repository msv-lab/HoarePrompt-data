The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer input value representing the number of test cases. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer input value representing the number of test cases and `t` must be greater than 0**
