### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts.
- The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price of two yogurts during the promotion is `b` burles.
- The goal is to minimize the total cost.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `n` and for each test case, it reads `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, there's a misinterpretation in the variable names:
- `a` in the problem statement is the price of one yogurt.
- `b` in the problem statement is the price of two yogurts during the promotion.
- `c` in the program is not used in the problem statement, which suggests it might be a typo or an incorrect variable.

Inside the loop:
- `d = c / 2` is calculated, which seems to be an attempt to find the average price per yogurt during the promotion. However, this is not useful for solving the problem.
- The comparison `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect. It compares the cost of buying `b` yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying `b` yogurts at the average promotion price per yogurt, which is not the correct logic.

#### Correct Approach:
1. Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price: `pairs = n // 2`.
2. Calculate the number of yogurts that will be left to buy at the regular price: `remaining = n % 2`.
3. The total cost can be calculated as: `total_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a`.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code does not correctly reflect the logic needed to solve the problem.
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are read correctly, but the logic for calculating the minimum cost is incorrect.
- The comparison `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts. It incorrectly calculates and compares costs and does not properly handle the number of yogurts to be bought at regular price versus the promotion price.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
