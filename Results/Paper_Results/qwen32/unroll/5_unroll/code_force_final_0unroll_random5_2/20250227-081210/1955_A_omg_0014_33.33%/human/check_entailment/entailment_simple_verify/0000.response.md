Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts.
- The price for one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price for two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles.
- The goal is to determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

### Provided Program Analysis
Here's the provided code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

### Annotations
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points but do not reflect the correct logic for calculating the minimum cost.

### Issues in the Provided Program
1. **Variable Misinterpretation**: The variable `c` is incorrectly interpreted as the price for two yogurts (`b` in the problem description). The correct variables should be `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside the loop is flawed. The program attempts to compare `a * b` (which is incorrect as `b` is already the price for two yogurts) with `a * d` (which is half of `c`, not relevant to the problem).

### Correct Approach
1. **Calculate Pairs**: Determine how many pairs of yogurts can be bought: `pairs = n // 2`.
2. **Calculate Remaining Yogurts**: Determine how many yogurts are left after buying pairs: `remaining = n % 2`.
3. **Calculate Total Cost**: Compute the total cost as `(pairs * b) + (remaining * a)`.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        total_cost = (pairs * b) + (remaining * a)
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

### Validation Using Annotated Code
The annotated code does not reflect the correct logic. The annotations describe the state of variables but do not validate the logic for calculating the minimum cost. The logic in the provided code is fundamentally flawed.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is **correct**. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given promotion.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
