Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Here, `a` is the price of one yogurt, `b` is the number of yogurts to be bought, and `c` is the price for two yogurts during the promotion.

2. **Variable Naming:**
   - There is a discrepancy in the variable names used in the problem statement and the program. In the problem statement, `n` is the number of yogurts to be bought, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price for two yogurts. However, in the program, `a`, `b`, and `c` are used, which seems to map to `b`, `a`, and `c` respectively in the problem statement. This is a misinterpretation in the code.
   - According to the problem statement, the correct mapping should be: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), `b` (price of two yogurts).

3. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which seems to be an attempt to calculate the average price per yogurt during the promotion. However, this is not the correct approach to solve the problem.
   - The comparison `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect because it compares the cost of buying `b` yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying `b` yogurts at the average promotion price per yogurt, which does not make sense in the context of the problem.
   - The correct approach should be to determine how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price and how many yogurts will be left to buy at the regular price.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price: `pairs = n // 2`.
   - Calculate the number of yogurts that will be left to buy at the regular price: `remaining = n % 2`.
   - The total cost can be calculated as: `total_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a`.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts. It incorrectly calculates and compares costs and does not properly handle the number of yogurts to be bought at regular price versus the promotion price.

### Correctness
Correctness: **False**
