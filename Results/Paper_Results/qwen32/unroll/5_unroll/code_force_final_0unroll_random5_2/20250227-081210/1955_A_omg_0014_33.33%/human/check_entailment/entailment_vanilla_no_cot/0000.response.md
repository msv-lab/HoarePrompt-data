Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are incorrectly mapped from the input. According to the problem statement, the input consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price for two yogurts on promotion. The variable `c` should not be used as it is not part of the input.

2. The logic for calculating the minimum cost is incorrect. The program incorrectly calculates `d = c / 2` and then compares `a * b` with `a * d`. Instead, the program should compare the cost of buying yogurts in pairs (`b`) versus buying them individually (`a`).

3. The program does not correctly handle the case when `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, the program should buy as many pairs as possible and then buy the remaining yogurt at the individual price.

A corrected version of the program would look something like this:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of pairs and the remaining yogurt
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        # Calculate the total cost
        total_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible and then buying any remaining yogurt at the individual price.
