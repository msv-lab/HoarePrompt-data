The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a string `s` containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet. It then prints the string `s` repeated `n` times if `k` is 1, or prints `s` repeated twice if `k` is greater than 1 and `n` is greater than 1, or prints an empty string if `k` is greater than 1 and `n` is 1.
