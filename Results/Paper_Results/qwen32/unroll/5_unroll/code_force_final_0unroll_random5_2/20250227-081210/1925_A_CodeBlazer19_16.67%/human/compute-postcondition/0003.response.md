The function `func` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint that 1 <= t <= 676. For each of the `t` test cases, the function receives two additional integers, `n` and `k`, where 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26. The functionality of the function is to process these test cases and return a result based on the provided values of `n` and `k` for each case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `k`, and returns a result based on these values.**
