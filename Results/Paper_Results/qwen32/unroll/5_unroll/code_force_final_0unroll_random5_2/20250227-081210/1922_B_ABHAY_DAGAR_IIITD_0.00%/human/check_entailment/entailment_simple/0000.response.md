Reasoning: 

The given program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. However, the logic in the function `func_1` is incorrect. 

The program uses the following incorrect logic:
1. It counts the number of sticks of each length and stores it in `num_of_lens`.
2. It calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length (using combinations of 3 from `cnt` sticks, where `cnt` is the count of sticks of a particular length).
3. It calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length.
4. It sums up these counts to get the total number of valid combinations.

However, the program does not correctly implement the triangle inequality theorem. The triangle inequality theorem states that for any three lengths to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. 

The program does not check this condition. It only counts combinations of sticks without verifying if they can actually form a triangle. 

For example, in the third test case of the example input, the lengths of the sticks are 2, 4, and 8. These lengths cannot form a triangle because 2 + 4 is not greater than 8. However, the program would count this combination as a valid triangle if it were implemented correctly.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
