In the provided loop statement:

```
for _ in range(test_cases):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a conventional name for a variable that we don't plan to use) and `test_cases`. The loop will execute based on the value of `test_cases`. Specifically, the loop will execute `test_cases` times. 

From the state provided, `test_cases` is a list of test cases. However, the `range` function in Python expects an integer, not a list. Therefore, we need to adjust `test_cases` to be an integer that represents the number of test cases rather than the list itself.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`test_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `results` is an empty list**

This adjustment ensures that the `for` loop can execute the correct number of times based on the number of test cases.
