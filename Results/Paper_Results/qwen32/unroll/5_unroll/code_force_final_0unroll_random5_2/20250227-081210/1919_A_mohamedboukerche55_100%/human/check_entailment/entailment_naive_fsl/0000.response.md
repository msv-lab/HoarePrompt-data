Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the optimal play strategy. The logic in the program is to check if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd, and then declare Bob as the winner if the sum is even and Alice as the winner if the sum is odd. However, this logic does not consider the game dynamics and the optimal moves that Alice and Bob can make.

Let's consider a few test cases to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

1. **Test Case: `a = 1`, `b = 1`**
   - According to the program, the sum is `2`, which is even, so the output is `Bob`.
   - However, the correct output should be `Bob` because Alice cannot make a move after taking one coin from her wallet, and Bob loses.

2. **Test Case: `a = 1`, `b = 4`**
   - According to the program, the sum is `5`, which is odd, so the output is `Alice`.
   - The correct output is `Alice` because Alice can swap wallets with Bob, then Bob will have 1 coin and Alice will have 4 coins. Bob will then have to take a coin, leaving Alice with 4 coins and Bob with 0 coins. Alice can then take a coin, leaving Bob with 0 coins and Alice with 3 coins. Bob cannot make a move, and Alice wins.

3. **Test Case: `a = 5`, `b = 3`**
   - According to the program, the sum is `8`, which is even, so the output is `Bob`.
   - The correct output is `Bob` because Alice can swap wallets with Bob, leaving Alice with 3 coins and Bob with 5 coins. Bob can then take a coin, leaving Alice with 3 coins and Bob with 4 coins. Alice can then take a coin, leaving Alice with 2 coins and Bob with 4 coins. Bob can then take a coin, leaving Alice with 2 coins and Bob with 3 coins. Alice can then take a coin, leaving Alice with 1 coin and Bob with 3 coins. Bob can then take a coin, leaving Alice with 1 coin and Bob with 2 coins. Alice can then take a coin, leaving Alice with 0 coins and Bob with 2 coins. Bob can then take a coin, leaving Alice with 0 coins and Bob with 1 coin. Alice cannot make a move, and Bob wins.

The program does not implement the optimal strategy for both players, and thus does not correctly determine the winner for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
