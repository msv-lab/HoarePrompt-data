#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y is 0. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))

                count += 1
        
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1

    #State: The results of all test cases printed sequentially.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0), and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the differences between the chosen vertices and the total number of vertices `n`.
