Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether the second row is reachable from the first row based on specified rules.**
