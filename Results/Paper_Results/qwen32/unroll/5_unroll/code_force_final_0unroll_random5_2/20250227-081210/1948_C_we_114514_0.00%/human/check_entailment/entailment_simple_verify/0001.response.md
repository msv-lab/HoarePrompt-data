### Reasoning:

Let's carefully evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

1. **Initial State and Transitions**:
   - The robot starts at `(1, 1)`, so `reachable_first_row` is initialized to `True` and `reachable_second_row` to `False`.
   - The program then iterates through each column `j` from `0` to `n-1` and updates the reachability based on the arrows in `row1` and `row2`.

2. **Detailed Analysis of Transitions**:
   - **First Row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`)**:
     - If the arrow in `row1[j]` is `>`, the robot can move right. If `j == n-1`, it can move down to `(2, n)`, setting `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
     - If the arrow in `row1[j]` is `<`, the robot cannot stay on the first row, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`. If there is an arrow `>` in `row2[j]`, the robot can move down to the second row, setting `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
   - **Second Row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`)**:
     - If the arrow in `row2[j]` is `>`, the robot can move right. If `j == n-1`, the robot reaches `(2, n)`, and `reachable_second_row` remains `True`.

3. **Annotations and Logic Validation**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The logic in the loop correctly updates the reachability states based on the arrows' directions and ensures the robot stays within grid boundaries.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Example 1**:
     ```
     n = 4
     row1 = ">><<"
     row2 = ">>><"
     ```
     - The robot can move from `(1, 1)` to `(1, 2)`, then to `(1, 3)`, then to `(2, 3)`, and finally to `(2, 4)`. The program should output `YES`.
   - **Example 2**:
     ```
     n = 2
     row1 = "><"
     row2 = "><"
     ```
     - The robot can move from `(1, 1)` to `(2, 1)` and then to `(2, 2)`. The program should output `YES`.
   - **Example 3**:
     ```
     n = 4
     row1 = ">>><"
     row2 = "><<<"
     ```
     - The robot cannot reach `(2, 4)`. The program should output `NO`.
   - **Example 4**:
     ```
     n = 6
     row1 = "><><><"
     row2 = "><>>><"
     ```
     - The robot can move from `(1, 1)` to `(2, 1)`, then to `(2, 2)`, then to `(1, 2)`, then to `(1, 3)`, then to `(2, 3)`, then to `(2, 4)`, and finally to `(2, 6)`. The program should output `YES`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)` based on the given problem description and constraints. The transitions and reachability checks are correctly handled.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
