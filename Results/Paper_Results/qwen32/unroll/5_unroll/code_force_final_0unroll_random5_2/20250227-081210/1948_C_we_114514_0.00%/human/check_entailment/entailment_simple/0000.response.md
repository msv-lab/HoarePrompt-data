### Reasoning:

The program attempts to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) given the rules for movement. Let's break down the logic of the program and see if it aligns with the problem requirements.

#### Key Points of the Program:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes two boolean variables, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`, to track whether the robot can reach the end of the first row and the second row, respectively.
2. **Iteration through Columns**: The program iterates through each column (from 1 to n).
3. **Movement in the First Row**:
   - If the robot is currently in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is True):
     - If the arrow in the current cell points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is at the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to True.
     - If the arrow in the current cell points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
       - The robot cannot stay in the first row, so `reachable_first_row` is set to False.
       - If the robot is not at the last column and the arrow in the corresponding cell of the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to True.
4. **Movement in the Second Row**:
   - If the robot is currently in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is True):
     - If the arrow in the current cell points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is at the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to True.
5. **Result Determination**: After iterating through all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is True, the result for the test case is 'YES'; otherwise, it is 'NO'.

#### Issues with the Logic:
- The program does not account for the possibility of the robot moving up or down between rows after its initial move.
- The program assumes that the robot can only move right in the second row, but it can also move left.
- The program does not correctly handle the possibility of the robot moving between the two rows based on the arrows.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine if the robot can reach (2, n), the program needs to simulate the robot's movement, taking into account all possible moves (left, right, up, down) and the arrows in each cell. This would involve maintaining a set of reachable positions and updating it based on the robot's possible moves at each step.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
