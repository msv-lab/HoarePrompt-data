In the provided for loop, the loop head contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which is the number of test cases (`t`). The loop will run `t` times.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, we need to ensure that `int(input())` returns a value that allows the loop to execute. Since `t` is already defined and within the valid range, we need to ensure that `int(input())` returns `t`.

Here's how we can adjust the state:

- The state already includes `t` as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, which is correct for the loop to execute.
- The loop head does not include `n`, `a`, or any other variables from the loop body, so we do not need to adjust those.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute as long as `int(input())` returns `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
