Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all the elements of the array zero using the specified operation. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range and Indexing**:
   - The loop `for i in range(0, a - 2)` is intended to iterate over indices where the operation can be applied, i.e., from `2` to `n-1` in 1-based indexing or `1` to `n-2` in 0-based indexing. The current loop starts at `0` and goes up to `a-3`, which is incorrect.
   - The operation should be applied to indices `i` such that `2 <= i <= n-1` in 1-based indexing, or `1 <= i <= n-2` in 0-based indexing.

2. **Incorrect Update Logic**:
   - The current logic `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` and `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` is incorrect. The operation should subtract `1` from `b[i-1]`, `2` from `b[i]`, and `1` from `b[i+1]`. The current logic incorrectly subtracts `b[i] * 2` from `b[i+1]` and `b[i]` from `b[i+2]`.

3. **Incorrect Check for Remaining Elements**:
   - The check `if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0` is incorrect because it only checks the last two elements. The operation can potentially leave earlier elements non-zero if the initial values are not properly handled.

### Corrected Approach:
- Iterate over the array from index `1` to `n-2` (0-based indexing).
- For each index `i`, apply the operation by subtracting `1` from `b[i-1]`, `2` from `b[i]`, and `1` from `b[i+1]`.
- After processing, check if all elements in the array are zero.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i] == 0:
                continue
            if a[i] < 2 or a[i-1] < 1 or a[i+1] < 1:
                print('NO')
                break
            a[i-1] -= 1
            a[i] -= 2
            a[i+1] -= 1
        else:
            if all(x == 0 for x in a):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

```

### Example Case Where Original Code Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 2 1 1
```
The original code will incorrectly print `NO` because it attempts to apply the operation starting from index `0`, which is invalid, and does not correctly update the array elements.

The corrected code will correctly determine that it is possible to make all elements zero by applying the operation at index `2` (0-based indexing) to get `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
