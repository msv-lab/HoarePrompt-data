You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 3 5 5 2
    
    5
    
    2 4 4 5 1
    
    5
    
    0 1 3 3 1
    
    6
    
    5 6 0 2 3 0
    
    4
    
    1 2 7 2
    
    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it performs a series of operations on the list and prints 'YES' if the list can be reduced to all zeros following the specified rules, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all the elements of the array zero using the specified operation. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range and Indexing**:
   - The loop `for i in range(0, a - 2)` is intended to iterate over indices where the operation can be applied, i.e., from `2` to `n-1` in 1-based indexing or `1` to `n-2` in 0-based indexing. The current loop starts at `0` and goes up to `a-3`, which is incorrect.
   - The operation should be applied to indices `i` such that `2 <= i <= n-1` in 1-based indexing, or `1 <= i <= n-2` in 0-based indexing.

2. **Incorrect Update Logic**:
   - The current logic `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` and `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` is incorrect. The operation should subtract `1` from `b[i-1]`, `2` from `b[i]`, and `1` from `b[i+1]`. The current logic incorrectly subtracts `b[i] * 2` from `b[i+1]` and `b[i]` from `b[i+2]`.

3. **Incorrect Check for Remaining Elements**:
   - The check `if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0` is incorrect because it only checks the last two elements. The operation can potentially leave earlier elements non-zero if the initial values are not properly handled.

### Corrected Approach:
- Iterate over the array from index `1` to `n-2` (0-based indexing).
- For each index `i`, apply the operation by subtracting `1` from `b[i-1]`, `2` from `b[i]`, and `1` from `b[i+1]`.
- After processing, check if all elements in the array are zero.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i] == 0:
                continue
            if a[i] < 2 or a[i-1] < 1 or a[i+1] < 1:
                print('NO')
                break
            a[i-1] -= 1
            a[i] -= 2
            a[i+1] -= 1
        else:
            if all(x == 0 for x in a):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

```

### Example Case Where Original Code Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 2 1 1
```
The original code will incorrectly print `NO` because it attempts to apply the operation starting from index `0`, which is invalid, and does not correctly update the array elements.

The corrected code will correctly determine that it is possible to make all elements zero by applying the operation at index `2` (0-based indexing) to get `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
