Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical flaw that prevents it from correctly determining if the array can be reduced to all zeros using the specified operations. Specifically, the program incorrectly modifies the array elements in a way that does not reflect the problem's rules. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Indexing and Operation Logic**: The program iterates over the array and attempts to modify elements based on the value of `b[i]`. However, the operations performed do not align with the problem's rules. The problem specifies that for an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1), the operation should be:
   - `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`
   - `a_i = a_i - 2`
   - `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`
   
   The current program instead performs:
   - `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2`
   - `b[i + 2] -= b[i]`
   - `b[i] -= b[i]`
   
   These operations do not correspond to the problem's rules and can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Negative Values and Early Termination**: The program checks if any element becomes negative and immediately prints 'NO'. While this is a valid check, the way the operations are performed can lead to incorrect negative values being set, causing premature termination even when a valid sequence of operations might exist.

3. **Final Check for Zeroes**: The program checks if the last two elements are zero after processing. However, due to the incorrect operations, this check does not accurately determine if the entire array can be reduced to zero.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
