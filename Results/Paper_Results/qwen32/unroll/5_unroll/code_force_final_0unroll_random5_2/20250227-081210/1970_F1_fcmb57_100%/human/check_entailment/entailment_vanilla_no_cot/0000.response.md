Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Quaffle Handling**: The program does not correctly handle the Quaffle's position. It should move the Quaffle when a player catches it and should reset its position to the center of the field when a goal is scored. The current program does not track the Quaffle's position or update it accordingly.

2. **Goal Scoring**: The program checks if a player is standing on a goal to determine if a point should be scored. However, it does not check if the player is carrying the Quaffle. According to the problem, a player must be carrying the Quaffle to score a point.

3. **Throwing the Quaffle**: The program does not handle the action of throwing the Quaffle. It should update the Quaffle's position to the player's position when the player throws the Quaffle.

4. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is defined after it is used in the code, which will cause a `NameError`. In Python, functions must be defined before they are called.

5. **Printing the Correct Team**: The program does not correctly identify which team scores a point when a player scores in the wrong goal. It should print the name of the team that wins the point, not the team that scored in the wrong goal.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
quaffle = None  # Track the position of the Quaffle

for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quaffle = (x, y)  # Initialize the Quaffle's position
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)

moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        if quaffle == players[mo[0]]:  # If the player is carrying the Quaffle, move the Quaffle too
            quaffle = players[mo[0]]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        if quaffle == players[mo[0]]:  # The player is already carrying the Quaffle
            continue
        if mo[2] == '.Q' and players[mo[0]] == quaffle:  # Catch the Quaffle
            quaffle = players[mo[0]]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        if quaffle == players[mo[0]]:  # Only throw if the player is carrying the Quaffle
            if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quaffle = ((m + 1) // 2 - 1, (n + 1) // 2 - 1)  # Reset Quaffle to the center

print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned above and should work correctly for the given problem.
