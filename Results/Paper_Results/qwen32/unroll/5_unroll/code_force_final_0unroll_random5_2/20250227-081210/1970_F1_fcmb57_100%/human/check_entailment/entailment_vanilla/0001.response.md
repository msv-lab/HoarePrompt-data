Reasoning:
1. The program reads the dimensions of the field (N, M) and then reads the field itself, storing the positions of players and goals in dictionaries (`players` and `goals` respectively).
2. It initializes the scores for both teams (`pointsr` and `pointsb`).
3. It reads the number of moves (T) and then iterates through each move.
4. For each move, it checks if the action is a movement (U, D, L, R) or a throw action (T).
5. If the action is a movement, it updates the player's position using the `func_1` function.
6. If the action is a throw, it checks if the player's position is in the goals of the other team and updates the score accordingly. It then prints the goal event.
7. Finally, it prints the final score.

However, there are several issues in the given program:
- The program does not handle the catch action (C).
- The program does not reset the Quaffle to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.
- The program does not check if the player is carrying the Quaffle before throwing it.
- The program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect as it does not fully implement the rules specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
