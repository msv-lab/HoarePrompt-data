Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of lines (N) and columns (M) in the field, respectively. It also accepts a field represented as a list of N strings, each containing M pairs of characters separated by spaces, and a series of T actions performed by entities on the field. The function returns a tuple `(a + b, y + dy)`, where `a` is the number of lines, `b` is the number of columns, and `dy` is undefined.**
