### Reasoning:
The provided program has a couple of issues that need to be addressed to ensure correctness.

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation Error:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to take a tuple `(x, y)` representing the current position of a player and a tuple `(dx, dy)` representing the movement direction. It should return the new position after the movement.
   - However, the function is incorrectly returning `(a + b, y + dy)`, where `a` and `b` are the number of lines and columns of the field, respectively, and `dy` is undefined in this context. 
   - The correct return statement should be `return (x + dx, y + dy)`.

2. **Scoring Logic Error:**
   - In the scoring logic, the program checks if the player's position is in the red goals list (`players[mo[0]] in goals['R']`) and increments the blue team's score (`pointsb += 1`). Similarly, it checks if the player's position is in the blue goals list (`players[mo[0]] in goals['B']`) and increments the red team's score (`pointsr += 1`).
   - This logic is incorrect because it doesn't differentiate between scoring in the correct goal and scoring in the wrong goal. It should check if the player belongs to the red team and is scoring in the blue goal, or if the player belongs to the blue team and is scoring in the red goal.
   - The correct logic should be:
     - If the player is red and scores in a blue goal, increment `pointsr`.
     - If the player is blue and scores in a red goal, increment `pointsb`.
     - If the player scores in their own goal, the other team should get the point.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not correct as it stands.

**Correctness: False**

### Corrected Implementation:
Here's how the corrected program might look:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..' or s[x] == '.Q':
            continue
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R'] and mo[0][0] == 'B':
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
        elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B'] and mo[0][0] == 'R':
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
        elif players[mo[0]] in goals['R'] and mo[0][0] == 'R':
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
        elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B'] and mo[0][0] == 'B':
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
```

### Explanation of Corrections:
1. **Function `func_1`:** 
   - Corrected the return statement to `return (x + dx, y + dy)`.

2. **Scoring Logic:**
   - Added checks to determine if the player is scoring in their own goal or the opponent's goal and updated the scores accordingly.
   - Added print statements to indicate the correct goal scored.

By making these corrections, the program should now correctly determine the score and print the appropriate events and final score.
