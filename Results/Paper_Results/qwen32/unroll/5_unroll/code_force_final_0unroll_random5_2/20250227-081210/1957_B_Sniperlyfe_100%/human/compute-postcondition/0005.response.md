The code snippet `nums[0] += k` increases the value of the first element in the list `nums` by the value of `k`. Given that `k = 0`, the value of `nums[0]` remains unchanged. The initial state specifies that `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. Since `k = 0`, `k.bit_length()` is 1, and thus `nums[0]` is `(1 << 0) - 1`, which simplifies to `0`.

Therefore, after executing the code, the value of `nums[0]` remains `0`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and k = 0, and nums is a list of length n where nums[0] is 0 and the subsequent elements are filled with the remaining k values until k becomes 0.**
