The provided code snippet only reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `t` while keeping the conditions on `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` as they were.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20, and `a`, `b`, `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
