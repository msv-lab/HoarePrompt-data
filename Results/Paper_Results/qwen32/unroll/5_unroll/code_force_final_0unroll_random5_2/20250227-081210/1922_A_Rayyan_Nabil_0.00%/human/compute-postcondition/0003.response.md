Let's analyze the loop to understand the final state of the variables after all iterations.

The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the following steps are performed:
1. `n` is read as an integer.
2. Strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are each read, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
3. The inner loop iterates `n` times, comparing characters of `a` and `b` with the corresponding characters of `c`.
4. If for any position `i` in the strings, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, the variable `l` is set to 'YES'.
5. If the inner loop completes without setting `l` to 'YES', `l` is set to 'NO'.
6. The value of `l` is then printed.

The key point here is the value of `l` after the inner loop for each test case. If there is at least one position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` differ from `c[i]`, `l` will be 'YES'. Otherwise, it will be 'NO'. After each test case, `l` is reset and recalculated based on the new inputs.

Since the outer loop runs `t` times, and for each test case, `l` is recalculated and printed, the final value of `l` after all iterations is the value that was printed in the last test case.

Given the structure of the code, the final state of `l` is determined solely by the last test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated in each iteration of the outer loop, but the final state of `l` is the result of the last test case.

Output State: **l is 'YES' or 'NO' based on the last test case.**
