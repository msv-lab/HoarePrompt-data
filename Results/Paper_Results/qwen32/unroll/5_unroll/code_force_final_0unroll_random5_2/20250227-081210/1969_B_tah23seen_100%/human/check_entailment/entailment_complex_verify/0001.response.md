Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost for sorting the binary string in non-descending order for all cases. The function only considers the cost of the first '0' encountered after a sequence of '1's and does not account for the cumulative cost of multiple operations needed to sort the string. This is evident from the example provided in the problem description for the string "11000". The function calculates a cost of 3, while the correct cost is 9, as it requires three separate operations to sort the string.

The annotations and the example analysis in the original assessment support the conclusion that the function is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in determining the function's correctness.

Final: **False**
