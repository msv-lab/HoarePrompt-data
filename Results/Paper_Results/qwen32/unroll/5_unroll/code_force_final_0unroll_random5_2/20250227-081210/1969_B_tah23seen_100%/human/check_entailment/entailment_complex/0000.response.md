### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on its substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) is \( r - l + 1 \).

The function `func_1(s)` provided calculates the cost based on the pattern of '0's following '1's in the string. Here's the reasoning behind the function:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `cost` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the total cost.
   - `one` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the count of '1's encountered so far.

2. **Iterating through the string**:
   - For each character in the string `s`:
     - If the character is '1', increment the `one` counter.
     - If the character is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, it means we have encountered a '0' after one or more '1's. The cost to move these '1's in front of this '0' is the number of '1's encountered so far (`one`) plus 1 (the cost for the cyclic shift involving this '0' and the preceding '1's). This cost is added to `cost`, and then `one` is reset to 0 for the next segment of '1's.

3. **Returning the cost**:
   - After iterating through the entire string, the function returns the total `cost`.

### Analysis:

The function `func_1(s)` correctly calculates the minimum cost based on the given pattern. It ensures that every segment of consecutive '1's followed by a '0' is accounted for, and the cost for each such segment is correctly computed and added to the total cost.

Let's verify the function with the example provided in the problem:

- **Test Case 1**: `s = "10"`
  - The function encounters a '1', increments `one` to 1.
  - Then it encounters a '0', and since `one` is greater than 0, it adds `one + 1` (which is 2) to `cost`.
  - The cost is 2, which matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 2**: `s = "0000"`
  - The string has no '1's, so `one` remains 0 throughout the iteration.
  - The cost remains 0, which matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 3**: `s = "11000"`
  - The function encounters two '1's, increments `one` to 2.
  - Then it encounters three '0's, and for each '0', it adds `one + 1` (which is 3) to `cost`.
  - The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, which matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 4**: `s = "101011"`
  - The function encounters a '1', increments `one` to 1.
  - Then it encounters a '0', and adds `one + 1` (which is 2) to `cost`.
  - Then it encounters another '1', increments `one` to 1.
  - Then it encounters another '0', and adds `one + 1` (which is 2) to `cost`.
  - Then it encounters two '1's, increments `one` to 2.
  - The total cost is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, which does not match the expected output of 5. This suggests there might be a misinterpretation or a mistake in the cost calculation logic.

- **Test Case 5**: `s = "01101001"`
  - The function encounters a '1', increments `one` to 1.
  - Then it encounters a '0', and adds `one + 1` (which is 2) to `cost`.
  - Then it encounters two '1's, increments `one` to 2.
  - Then it encounters a '0', and adds `one + 1` (which is 3) to `cost`.
  - Then it encounters a '1', increments `one` to 1.
  - Then it encounters two '0's, and for each '0', it adds `one + 1` (which is 2) to `cost`.
  - The total cost is 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 9, which does not match the expected output of 11.

Based on the above analysis, it seems that the function `func_1(s)` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all test cases. Specifically, the cost calculation logic does not account for all possible cyclic shifts that could minimize the total cost.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1(s)` is not correct for all test cases, as demonstrated by the discrepancies in the test cases 4 and 5.

**Correctness: False**
