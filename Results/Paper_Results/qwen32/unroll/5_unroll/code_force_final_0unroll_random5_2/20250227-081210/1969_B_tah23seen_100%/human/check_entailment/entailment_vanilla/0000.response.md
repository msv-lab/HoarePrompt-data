To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using the allowed operations.

First, let's understand the logic behind the provided function:

1. The function `func_1` iterates over each character in the binary string `s`.
2. It keeps track of the number of '1's encountered so far with the variable `one`.
3. Whenever a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's (`one > 0`), the cost is incremented by `one + 1`.

The key insight here is that the cost `one + 1` is added every time a '0' follows one or more '1's because to move the '0' to the left of all the '1's encountered so far, we would need to perform a series of cyclic shifts on the substring that includes all these '1's and the '0'. The cost of each such operation is the length of the substring, which is `one + 1` (since it includes the '0' and all the '1's encountered so far).

Let's verify this with the example cases provided in the problem:

1. For the string "10":
   - The first character is '1', so `one` becomes 1.
   - The second character is '0', and since `one` is greater than 0, the cost is incremented by `one + 1` = 2.
   - The final cost is 2, which matches the expected output.

2. For the string "0000":
   - The string is already sorted, so no operations are needed, and the cost remains 0.
   - The final cost is 0, which matches the expected output.

3. For the string "11000":
   - The first two characters are '1's, so `one` becomes 2.
   - The third character is '0', and since `one` is greater than 0, the cost is incremented by `one + 1` = 3.
   - The next two characters are '0's, but since there are no more '1's encountered, the cost does not change.
   - The final cost is 3, but the expected output is 9. This suggests that the function does not correctly calculate the cost for this case.

Let's analyze the third example in more detail:

- The optimal strategy involves multiple operations:
  1. Choose substring [1, 3]: 11000 -> 01100 (cost 3)
  2. Choose substring [2, 4]: 01100 -> 00110 (cost 3)
  3. Choose substring [3, 5]: 00110 -> 00011 (cost 3)
- The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.

The function `func_1` does not correctly account for the cumulative cost of multiple operations needed to sort the string. It only adds the cost of the first '0' encountered after '1's and does not consider subsequent operations.

Therefore, the function `func_1` is incorrect for some cases, specifically for cases where multiple operations are needed to sort the string.

Reasoning: The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost for all cases, particularly when multiple operations are required to sort the string.

Correctness: **False**
