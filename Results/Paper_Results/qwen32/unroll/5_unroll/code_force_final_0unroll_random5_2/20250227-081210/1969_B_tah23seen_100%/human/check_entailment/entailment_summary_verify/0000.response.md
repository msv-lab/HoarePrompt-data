Let's analyze the provided code and function summary to determine if the original assessment is correct.

### Code Analysis

The function `func_1` calculates the cost based on the number of '1's encountered before each '0'. The logic is as follows:
1. Initialize `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
2. Iterate through each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is '1', increment the `one` counter.
   - If the character is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, add `one + 1` to `cost`.

### Function Summary

The function summary states that the function calculates and returns the total cost based on the pattern of '0's following '1's in a given binary string `s`.

### Correctness Evaluation

Let's evaluate the function's correctness using the problem description and the provided counterexample.

#### Counterexample Analysis

**Input:**
```
1
11010
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
- Perform a cyclic shift on the substring `[1, 3]`: `11010 -> 01110` (cost = 3)
- The string is now sorted.

**Output from Provided Code:**
- `one = 2` (encountered two '1's)
- The first '0' is encountered, so `cost += one + 1 = 3`
- The second '0' is encountered, so `cost += one + 1 = 3`
- Total cost = 6 (which is incorrect)

The provided code indeed calculates a cost of 6 for the input `11010`, which is not the minimum cost required to sort the string.

### General Analysis

The function `func_1` does not consider the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to achieve the sorted order. It simply adds the cost based on the number of '1's before each '0', which does not account for the minimum operations required to sort the string.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not always produce the minimum cost required to sort the string in non-descending order using the described cyclic shift operations.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect.
