Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost for all cases, particularly when multiple operations are needed to sort the string. The function only adds the cost of the first '0' encountered after '1's and does not consider subsequent operations. This is evident from the third test case, where the function outputs 3 instead of the correct answer 9. Therefore, the function `func_1` is incorrect.

Final: **False**
