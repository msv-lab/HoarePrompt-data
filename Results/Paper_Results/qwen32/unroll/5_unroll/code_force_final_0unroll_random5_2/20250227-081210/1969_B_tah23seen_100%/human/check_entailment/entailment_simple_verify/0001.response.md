### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` does not accurately compute the minimum total cost for making the binary string sorted in non-descending order. The function only considers the first '0' encountered after a sequence of '1's and calculates the cost based on that, without accounting for subsequent operations that might be necessary.

Let's break down the issues using the annotations and the provided examples:

1. **First Example ("10"):**
   - The function correctly identifies that a single operation is required to move the '0' to the left of the '1'.
   - The cost is calculated as `one + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`, which matches the expected output.

2. **Second Example ("0000"):**
   - The string is already sorted, so no operations are needed.
   - The cost remains 0, which matches the expected output.

3. **Third Example ("11000"):**
   - The function calculates the cost as `one + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3` when the first '0' is encountered.
   - However, the optimal strategy involves multiple operations, each costing 3, resulting in a total cost of 9.
   - The function fails to account for these multiple operations and thus provides an incorrect result.

4. **Fourth Example ("101011"):**
   - The function does not correctly compute the cost for this case either, as it fails to account for the sequence of operations needed to sort the string.
   - The expected output is 5, but the function does not provide this.

5. **Fifth Example ("01101001"):**
   - Similarly, the function does not correctly compute the cost for this case, as it does not account for the sequence of operations needed to sort the string.
   - The expected output is 11, but the function does not provide this.

The core issue is that the function `func_1` does not simulate the actual process of cyclically shifting substrings to sort the string. Instead, it makes a simplified assumption about the cost based on the first '0' encountered after '1's, which is not sufficient for all cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis above, the original assessment is accurate in identifying that the function `func_1` is incorrect for some cases. The function does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost for making the binary string sorted in non-descending order.

**Final: False**
