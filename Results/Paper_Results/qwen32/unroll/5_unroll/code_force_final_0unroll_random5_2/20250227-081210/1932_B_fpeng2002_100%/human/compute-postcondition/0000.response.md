Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `num_tests` is assigned the value of the input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables `t`, `n`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.
