Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of lists. Each sublist represents a test case and contains `n+1` integers. The first integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of `a_i` for each test case is divisible by `n`. The function returns 'NO' if a certain condition is not met (details of the condition are not provided in the constraints), and 'YES' if the condition is met.**
