You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if total % n != 0:
        return 'NO'
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case containing `n+1` integers. The first integer `n` specifies the number of containers, and the subsequent `n` integers represent the amounts of water in these containers. The function checks if it is possible to redistribute the water in the containers such that each container has the same amount, given that the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. If the redistribution condition is met, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The code checks if the cumulative difference between the current container's water level and the mean is ever negative, which is not a correct way to determine if we can equalize the water levels using the allowed operations.

Here's a detailed explanation of why the code is incorrect and a counterexample:

### Flawed Logic:
The function `func_1` iterates through the list of water levels (`nums`), calculating the cumulative difference between the current water level and the mean water level (`mean`). If this cumulative difference becomes negative at any point, the function incorrectly returns 'NO'. However, this check does not accurately reflect the possibility of redistributing water using the allowed operations (pouring water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`).

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
For this input, the mean water level is `(1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2`. The cumulative differences are:
- After the first container (1): `1 - 2 = -1` (cumulative difference = -1)
- After the second container (2): `-1 + (2 - 2) = -1` (cumulative difference = -1)
- After the third container (3): `-1 + (3 - 2) = 0` (cumulative difference = 0)

The function would return 'NO' because the cumulative difference was negative at one point. However, it is possible to equalize the water levels by pouring 1 unit of water from the third container to the first container, resulting in `[2, 2, 2]`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine if it's possible to equalize the water levels, we need to ensure that at no point do we need to pour water from a container with less water to a container with more water, which is not allowed by the problem constraints. The correct approach involves checking if the prefix sums of the differences (water level - mean) are non-negative.

### Corrected Code (for reference):
```python
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))
```

However, the original code already follows this logic, but the explanation above clarifies why this logic is correct. The original code seems to be correct based on the problem description and the logic it follows.

Since the code does not have any obvious issues and follows the correct logic, the original code is indeed correct.

### Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly checks if the cumulative difference between the current water level and the mean water level is non-negative at all points, which is a valid approach to determine if it's possible to equalize the water levels using the allowed operations. The code handles all edge cases and works as expected for the given problem description.
