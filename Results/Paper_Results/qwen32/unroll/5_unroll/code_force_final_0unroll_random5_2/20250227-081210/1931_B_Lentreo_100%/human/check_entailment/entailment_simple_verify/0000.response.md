### Reasoning:
The provided program is designed to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. The logic implemented in the function `func_1` is correct based on the problem description.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and the annotations:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It calculates the mean amount of water each container should have, which is `total // n`.
   - It initializes a variable `curr` to keep track of the cumulative difference between the current container's water level and the mean.
   - It iterates through the list of water amounts, updating `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water level and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that the current container has less water than required to balance the previous containers, and it is impossible to redistribute water from a container with less water to a container with more water using the allowed operations. Hence, it returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it means that the water can be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount of water, so it returns 'YES'.

3. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, including the cumulative difference calculation and the condition checks.
   - The annotations confirm that the logic is correctly implemented and that the cumulative difference check is appropriate for the problem constraints.

4. **Counterexample Revisited:**
   - The counterexample provided in the original assessment is incorrect in its interpretation. The function `func_1` correctly handles the case where the cumulative difference becomes negative, which is a valid check for the problem constraints.
   - For the test case `[1, 2, 3]`, the cumulative differences are:
     - After the first container (1): `1 - 2 = -1` (cumulative difference = -1)
     - After the second container (2): `-1 + (2 - 2) = -1` (cumulative difference = -1)
     - After the third container (3): `-1 + (3 - 2) = 0` (cumulative difference = 0)
   - Although the cumulative difference was negative at one point, this does not mean it is impossible to redistribute the water. The function correctly returns 'NO' because it is not possible to pour water from a container with less water to a container with more water using the allowed operations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the water in all containers can be made equal using the specified operations. The annotations and the logic in the function `func_1` are consistent with the problem description and handle all edge cases appropriately.

### Final: **True**
