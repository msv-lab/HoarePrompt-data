### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotations to ensure correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have `n` containers with water amounts `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
- The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
- We can pour water from container `i` to container `j` if `i < j`.
- We need to determine if we can make all containers have the same amount of water.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Target Water Level**: Since the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, the target water level for each container is `mean = total / n`.
2. **Operation Constraint**: Water can only be poured from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.

#### Solution Strategy:
- Calculate the target water level `mean`.
- Traverse the containers from left to right, maintaining a running total `curr` of the difference between the current water level and the target `mean`.
- If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it means we need to pour water from a container that should have less water than the target to a container that should have more water, which is impossible given the constraints.
- If `curr` never becomes negative, it means we can achieve the equal distribution by pouring water from left to right.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows this strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
3. It defines a function `func_1` that:
   - Calculates the target water level `mean`.
   - Initializes a running total `curr` to 0.
   - Iterates through the list of water amounts, updating `curr` by adding the difference between the current water amount and `mean`.
   - If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it returns "NO".
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns "YES".

#### Annotations and Validation:
- The annotations state that `nums` is a list of integers representing the water amounts for a test case.
- The program correctly calculates `total` and `mean`.
- The running total `curr` is updated correctly by adding the difference between each `nums[i]` and `mean`.
- If `curr` becomes negative, the program correctly returns "NO".
- If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, the program correctly returns "YES".

#### Example Validation:
Let's validate the program using the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `1`, `43`
   - `mean = 43`
   - `curr = 43 - 43 = 0`
   - Output: `YES` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `2`, `1 3`
   - `mean = 2`
   - `curr = 1 - 2 = -1` (Negative, so output `NO`)
   - Output: `NO` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `5`, `4 5 2 1 3`
   - `mean = 3`
   - `curr = 4-3 + 5-3 + 2-3 + 1-3 + 3-3 = 1 + 2 - 1 - 2 + 0 = 0`
   - Output: `YES` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `3`, `1 2 3`
   - `mean = 2`
   - `curr = 1-2 + 2-2 + 3-2 = -1 + 0 + 1 = 0` (Negative at some point, but the correct sequence of operations can still balance it out; however, the logic correctly identifies it as `NO` because it can't handle the intermediate negative balance)
   - Output: `NO` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `7`, `4 5 5 0 6 4 4`
   - `mean = 4`
   - `curr = 4-4 + 5-4 + 5-4 + 0-4 + 6-4 + 4-4 + 4-4 = 0 + 1 + 1 - 4 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 0` (Negative at some point, but the correct sequence of operations can still balance it out; however, the logic correctly identifies it as `NO` because it can't handle the intermediate negative balance)
   - Output: `NO` (Correct)

6. **Test Case 6**:
   - Input: `7`, `6 5 5 1 3 4 4`
   - `mean = 4`
   - `curr = 6-4 + 5-4 + 5-4 + 1-4 + 3-4 + 4-4 + 4-4 = 2 + 1 + 1 - 3 - 1 + 0 + 0 = 0`
   - Output: `YES` (Correct)

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the given operation constraints. The annotations confirm that the program's behavior matches the expected logic.

Final: **True**
