Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. The program only handles two specific cases:
1. When the length of the array is 2, it outputs a fixed result of "4 1" and the operation "1 2".
2. For any other length of the array (other than 2), it outputs a fixed result of "13 0" without performing any operations.

This approach is incorrect for several reasons:
- The problem requires the program to compute the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the allowed operations.
- The program does not consider the actual values of the elements in the array.
- The program does not implement the logic to find the MEX of any subarray and update the subarray accordingly.
- The program does not handle all possible input cases, especially when the array length is not 2.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
However, the given program would output "13 0" for this input, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is not correct for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
