Postcondition: **`c` is a list of integers where the length of `c` (denoted as `n`) satisfies 1 <= `n` <= 18, and each element in `c` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^7; `m` is 0. The current value of `c` is 2.** 

However, there seems to be a logical inconsistency in the if condition provided, as `c` is defined as a list of integers, and checking if `c == 2` would always be false. Assuming the intention was to check an element of the list or a related condition, the provided postcondition reflects the given information accurately. If there's an error in the if condition, please clarify for a more accurate postcondition.
