Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the maximum beauty of the array incorrectly. The goal is to maximize the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) by rearranging the elements. The correct approach is to sort the array and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(1, len(a), 1):
            kq = kq + a[i] - a[i - 1]
        print(kq)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In the corrected version, after sorting the array, the program computes the beauty by summing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 1 to n. This ensures that the beauty is maximized.
