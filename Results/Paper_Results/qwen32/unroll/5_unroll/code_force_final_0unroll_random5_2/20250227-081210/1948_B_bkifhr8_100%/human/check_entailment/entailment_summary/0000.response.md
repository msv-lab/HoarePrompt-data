Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operations. The current implementation incorrectly checks if the digits of the merged elements are in non-decreasing order, but it does not properly simulate the operation of splitting elements and reordering the array.

The key issue is that the program only checks if the digits of the current element and the previous element can be rearranged to be in non-decreasing order, but it does not actually perform the operation of splitting the element and reordering the array. It also does not consider the possibility of splitting multiple elements or reordering elements that are not adjacent.

Here's a correct approach to solve the problem:
1. Iterate through the array from left to right.
2. For each element that is at least 10, split it into its digits and insert them back into the array at the same position.
3. After splitting all possible elements, check if the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given the complexity of simulating the operation and checking all possible ways to split elements, a more feasible approach is to use a greedy strategy or dynamic programming to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations.

Since the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
