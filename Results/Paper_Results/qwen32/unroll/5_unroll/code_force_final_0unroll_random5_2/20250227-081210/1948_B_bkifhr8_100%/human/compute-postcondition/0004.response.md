Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers. For each test case, it checks if the array can be rearranged by merging adjacent elements such that the digits of the merged elements are in non-decreasing order. It outputs 'YES' if such a rearrangement is possible for the array, otherwise 'NO'.**
