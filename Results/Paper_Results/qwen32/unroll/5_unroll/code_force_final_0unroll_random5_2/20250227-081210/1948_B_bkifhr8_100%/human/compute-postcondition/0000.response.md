Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50) representing the length of the array, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99) representing the elements of the array. `n` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input.**

In simple terms: `n` has been assigned the value from the first integer input, while `t` and the array elements remain as described in the initial state.
