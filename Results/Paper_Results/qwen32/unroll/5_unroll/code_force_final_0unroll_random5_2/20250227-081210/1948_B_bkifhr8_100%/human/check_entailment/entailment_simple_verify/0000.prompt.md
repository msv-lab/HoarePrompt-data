You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the array, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99) representing the elements of the array.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: a series of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle all cases for transforming the array into a sorted one using the described operations. Specifically, the logic for splitting elements and checking if the resulting array can be sorted is flawed.

Let's analyze the provided code and identify the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Splitting and Sorting**:
   - The current implementation checks if the array can be sorted by only considering the last element that is out of order and trying to split the previous element to see if it can be rearranged to maintain the order.
   - However, the problem requires checking if the array can be sorted by performing the operation any number of times, which means we need to consider multiple splits and rearrangements.

2. **Logic for Splitting**:
   - The code splits the previous element and appends the current element to the digits of the previous element.
   - It then checks if the resulting list is sorted. However, this does not guarantee that the entire array can be sorted by further operations.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 28, 5]`. The code will try to split `12` and append `3`, but this does not lead to a sorted array. The correct approach would involve checking all possible splits and rearrangements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split and rearranged to achieve a sorted order.
   - For instance, the array `[12, 28, 5]` cannot be sorted by splitting `12` and `28` alone. The correct transformation would involve splitting `28` to get `[1, 2, 8, 5]` and then further rearranging.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The code correctly processes multiple test cases, but the logic within each test case is flawed.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to implement a more comprehensive approach that considers all possible splits and rearrangements of elements to determine if the array can be sorted.

Here is a counterexample where the provided program fails:

**Input**:
```
1
4
12 28 5 6
```

**Expected Output**:
```
NO
```

**Explanation**:
- The array `[12, 28, 5, 6]` cannot be sorted by splitting `12` and `28` alone. Splitting `12` results in `[1, 2, 28, 5, 6]`, which is not sorted. Splitting `28` results in `[12, 2, 8, 5, 6]`, which is also not sorted. No combination of splits can result in a sorted array.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect, and the correct answer is `False`.
