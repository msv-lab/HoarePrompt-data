Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle all cases for transforming the array into a sorted one using the described operations. Specifically, the logic for splitting elements and checking if the resulting array can be sorted is flawed.

Let's analyze the provided code and identify the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Splitting and Sorting**:
   - The current implementation checks if the array can be sorted by only considering the last element that is out of order and trying to split the previous element to see if it can be rearranged to maintain the order.
   - However, the problem requires checking if the array can be sorted by performing the operation any number of times, which means we need to consider multiple splits and rearrangements.

2. **Logic for Splitting**:
   - The code splits the previous element and appends the current element to the digits of the previous element.
   - It then checks if the resulting list is sorted. However, this does not guarantee that the entire array can be sorted by further operations.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 28, 5]`. The code will try to split `12` and append `3`, but this does not lead to a sorted array. The correct approach would involve checking all possible splits and rearrangements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split and rearranged to achieve a sorted order.
   - For instance, the array `[12, 28, 5]` cannot be sorted by splitting `12` and `28` alone. The correct transformation would involve splitting `28` to get `[1, 2, 8, 5]` and then further rearranging.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The code correctly processes multiple test cases, but the logic within each test case is flawed.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to implement a more comprehensive approach that considers all possible splits and rearrangements of elements to determine if the array can be sorted.

Here is a counterexample where the provided program fails:

**Input**:
```
1
4
12 28 5 6
```

**Expected Output**:
```
NO
```

**Explanation**:
- The array `[12, 28, 5, 6]` cannot be sorted by splitting `12` and `28` alone. Splitting `12` results in `[1, 2, 28, 5, 6]`, which is not sorted. Splitting `28` results in `[12, 2, 8, 5, 6]`, which is also not sorted. No combination of splits can result in a sorted array.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect, and the correct answer is `False`.
