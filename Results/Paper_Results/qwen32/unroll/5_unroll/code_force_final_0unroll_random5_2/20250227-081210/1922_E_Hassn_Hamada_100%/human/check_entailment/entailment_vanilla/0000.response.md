Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to construct an array such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X. The array can have a length of at most 200, and if no such array exists, the program should output -1.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the integer X.

2. **Recursive Function `func_1`**: This function is supposed to generate the sequence based on the input number. It uses a binary representation approach to determine the sequence.

3. **Base Case**: If `number` is 0, it returns (0, 0). This is correct as there are no elements to add to the sequence.

4. **Loop and Calculation**: The loop iterates from the maximum value in the sequence down to 0. It calculates the size and value based on the binary representation. The while loop increments the size and value until a certain condition is met. If the value is less than or equal to the number, it sets `size_overlap`.

5. **Appending to Sequence**: Based on `size_overlap`, it appends elements to the sequence. It then recursively calls `func_1` with a modified number.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Function Return Value**: The function `func_1` is supposed to modify the `sequence` list in place, but it also returns a tuple `(0, 0)`. The return value is not used anywhere in the program, so this might be a leftover from an earlier implementation.

2. **Appending Logic**: The appending logic seems correct, but the initial value of `size_overlap` is set to `(0, 0)`. If the loop doesn't find a suitable value, it will use this default value, which might lead to incorrect results.

3. **Handling of Large X**: The program uses bitwise operations to handle large values of X, which is a good approach. However, the logic for determining the sequence might not cover all edge cases, especially for very large X.

4. **Output**: The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself. However, it doesn't handle the case where no such sequence exists (which is not explicitly checked in the provided code).

5. **Edge Cases**: The program doesn't handle the case where X is 1 or less, although the problem statement specifies that X is at least 2. However, the program doesn't handle the case where no sequence can be formed for a given X, which should return -1.

### Conclusion
Given the above points, the program seems to have logical issues, particularly in handling edge cases and ensuring that a valid sequence is always found. The provided examples might work, but the program lacks proper handling of cases where no sequence can be formed.

Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the provided code and problem description is:

Correctness: **False**
