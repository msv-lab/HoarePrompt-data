Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences. There are several issues with the code:

1. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence that results in a specific number of increasing subsequences, but it does not do so correctly. It always returns `(0, 0)` regardless of the input, which is not useful for the problem at hand.
2. The loop inside `func_1` is intended to calculate the size and value for the sequence, but the logic is flawed. It does not correctly determine the size and value needed to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.
3. The recursive call to `func_1` does not correctly update the `number` parameter to reflect the remaining number of increasing subsequences that need to be accounted for.
4. The program does not handle the base case correctly. If `number` is 0, it should return an empty sequence, but it returns `(0, 0)` instead.
5. The program does not print the sequence correctly. It attempts to print the length and the sequence itself, but the sequence is not being generated correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
