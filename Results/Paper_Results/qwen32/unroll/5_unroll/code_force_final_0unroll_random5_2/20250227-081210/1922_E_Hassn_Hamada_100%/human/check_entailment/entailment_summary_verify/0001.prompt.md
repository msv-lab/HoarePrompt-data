You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

        while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:

    func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer, and `sequence`, a list of positive integers. Regardless of the input values, the function always returns the tuple `(0, 0)`. The function modifies the `sequence` list by appending additional numbers based on certain calculations, but the final return value is consistently `(0, 0)`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to construct an array such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X. The array can have a length of at most 200, and if no such array exists, the program should output -1.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the integer X.

2. **Recursive Function `func_1`**: This function is supposed to generate the sequence based on the input number. It uses a binary representation approach to determine the sequence.

3. **Base Case**: If `number` is 0, it returns (0, 0). This is correct as there are no elements to add to the sequence.

4. **Loop and Calculation**: The loop iterates from the maximum value in the sequence down to 0. It calculates the size and value based on the binary representation. The while loop increments the size and value until a certain condition is met. If the value is less than or equal to the number, it sets `size_overlap`.

5. **Appending to Sequence**: Based on `size_overlap`, it appends elements to the sequence. It then recursively calls `func_1` with a modified number.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Function Return Value**: The function `func_1` is supposed to modify the `sequence` list in place, but it also returns a tuple `(0, 0)`. The return value is not used anywhere in the program, so this might be a leftover from an earlier implementation.

2. **Appending Logic**: The appending logic seems correct, but the initial value of `size_overlap` is set to `(0, 0)`. If the loop doesn't find a suitable value, it will use this default value, which might lead to incorrect results.

3. **Handling of Large X**: The program uses bitwise operations to handle large values of X, which is a good approach. However, the logic for determining the sequence might not cover all edge cases, especially for very large X.

4. **Output**: The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself. However, it doesn't handle the case where no such sequence exists (which is not explicitly checked in the provided code).

5. **Edge Cases**: The program doesn't handle the case where X is 1 or less, although the problem statement specifies that X is at least 2. However, the program doesn't handle the case where no sequence can be formed for a given X, which should return -1.

### Conclusion
Given the above points, the program seems to have logical issues, particularly in handling edge cases and ensuring that a valid sequence is always found. The provided examples might work, but the program lacks proper handling of cases where no sequence can be formed.

Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the provided code and problem description is:

Correctness: **False**
