The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop will execute based on the range defined by `size - overlap`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `size - overlap` is greater than 0 to make the loop execute. The state of `size` and `overlap` (which is `i` in the context of the list `size_overlap`) needs to be adjusted accordingly.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `size - overlap > 0`.
2. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will take values from `0` to `size - overlap - 1`.
3. The state before the loop starts includes `size` being the first element of `size_overlap` and `overlap` being the second element of `size_overlap`.

To ensure the loop executes, `size` must be greater than `overlap`.

State: **`size_overlap` is a list where the first element (`size`) is greater than the second element (`overlap`)**
