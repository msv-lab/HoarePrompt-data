The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `final`. No other variables are mentioned in the initial state, and no calculations or changes are made to `n` or the pairs of integers described in the precondition. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `final` list.

Output State: **The function will receive multiple test cases. For each test case, it will first receive an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard. Following this, it will receive 2n integers (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard. The function should handle up to 5000 such test cases. `n` is an input integer. `final` is an empty list.**
