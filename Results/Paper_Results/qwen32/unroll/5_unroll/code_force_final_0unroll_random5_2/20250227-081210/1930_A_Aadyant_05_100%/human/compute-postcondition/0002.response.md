To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state before the for loop starts, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for num in range(int(n)):`. The only variable here that can be adjusted is `n`.

The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 because `range(int(n))` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and the loop will iterate over this sequence. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The state of `final` is not relevant to the loop's execution as it is not mentioned in the loop head.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `final` is an empty list**.
