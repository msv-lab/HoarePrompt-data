You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5. c is a list of n integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5 and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `b` is a list of n+1 integers where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` for 1 <= i <= n is the cumulative sum of 1s and 2s based on the condition `a[j] > 1` for 1 <= j <= i.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):

        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is the cumulative sum of 1s and 2s based on the condition `a[j] > 1` for `1 <= j <= i`; `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the elements from `a[0]` to `a[i]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines whether the sum of the elements in a specified sublist is greater than the count of elements in that sublist that are greater than 1. It outputs "YES" if the sum is greater and "NO" otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
For a subarray to be considered "good," there must exist another array `b` such that:
1. The sum of elements in the subarray `a` is equal to the sum of elements in the subarray `b`.
2. No element in `a` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
3. All elements in `b` are greater than 0.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array `c`), `q` (number of queries), and the array `c`.
   - It then reads `q` queries, each consisting of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`.

2. **Array `a` and `b` Construction:**
   - The program creates an array `a` which is the prefix sum array of `c`.
   - It creates an array `b` where each element is either 1 or 2 (based on whether the corresponding element in `a` is greater than 1 or not). This is intended to ensure that `b` has a sum that can potentially match the sum of a subarray of `a`.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]` using the prefix sum array `a`.
   - It calculates the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b` using the prefix sum array `b`.
   - It checks if the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the subarray in `b` or if the subarray length is 1. If either condition is true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Condition for "Good" Subarray:**
   - The program does not ensure that `a_i ≠ b_i` for every index `i` in the subarray. It only ensures that the sum of `b` is at least the sum of `a` for the subarray, which is not sufficient.
   - The logic for constructing `b` does not guarantee that `b_i > 0` and `b_i ≠ a_i` for all `i`.

2. **Subarray Length Check:**
   - The program incorrectly checks if `x == y` (which corresponds to a subarray of length 1) and prints "NO" in that case. This is not necessarily correct because a subarray of length 1 can still be "good" if the element in `a` is not 1.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine if a subarray is "good" based on the problem's conditions.
