You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is good based on the problem description. Specifically, the logic for checking the conditions of a good array is flawed.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1**: \(\sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i\)
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of the subarray and compares it with a constructed `b` array's prefix sums. However, the construction of `b` is incorrect and does not guarantee that the sums will be equal.

2. **Condition 2**: \(a_i \neq b_i\) for every index \(i\) from 1 to \(m\)
   - The program constructs `b` such that each element is either 1 or 2, but it does not ensure that each \(a_i \neq b_i\).

3. **Condition 3**: \(b_i > 0\) for every index \(i\) from 1 to \(m\)
   - The program ensures that each element in `b` is either 1 or 2, which satisfies this condition.

### Specific Issue:
The program incorrectly constructs the `b` array. It assigns `b[i]` as 1 if `a[i] > 1` and 2 if `a[i] == 1`. This does not guarantee that the sum of `b` will equal the sum of `a` for any subarray, and it does not ensure that each \(a_i \neq b_i\).

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 1
1 1 1
1 3
```
- The subarray is `[1, 1, 1]`.
- The program constructs `b` as `[0, 2, 2, 2]` (since each element in `a` is 1, each corresponding `b` is 2).
- The sum of the subarray `[1, 1, 1]` is 3.
- The sum of the constructed `b` subarray `[2, 2, 2]` is 6.
- Since the sums are not equal, the program incorrectly prints "NO".

### Correctness:
The program fails for this case and potentially for other cases where the sums do not match or where \(a_i = b_i\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
