### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to verify if the logic implemented in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the described operations.

#### Problem Understanding:
- **Cyclic Shift:** A cyclic shift of a substring moves the last character of the substring to the beginning.
- **Cost Calculation:** The cost to cyclically shift a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.
- **Goal:** Minimize the total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's followed by all '1's).

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
The function `func_1` reads a binary string `s` and calculates the accumulated sum of `(n + 1)` for each sequence of consecutive '1's followed by a '0', where `n` is the count of '1's in the sequence.

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Initialization:** `n` is initialized to 0 (count of '1's) and `ans` is initialized to 0 (accumulated cost).
2. **Loop through the string:**
   - If the current character is '1', increment `n`.
   - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not 0, add `(n + 1)` to `ans`. This step implies that for every '0' encountered after a sequence of '1's, the cost to shift the preceding '1's to the right is added to `ans`.

#### Correctness of the Logic:
The key observation is that each transition from a sequence of '1's to a '0' requires shifting the preceding '1's. The cost of such a shift is `n + 1`, where `n` is the count of '1's in the sequence. This logic correctly accounts for the cost incurred for each such transition.

#### Example Verification:
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Input:** `10`
   - Sequence: `1` followed by `0`
   - `n` = 1 (one '1')
   - `ans` = 1 + 1 = 2 (cost to shift the single '1' to the right of '0')
   - **Output:** `2` (correct)

2. **Input:** `0000`
   - No '1's, so no transitions
   - **Output:** `0` (correct)

3. **Input:** `11000`
   - Sequence: `11` followed by `0`
   - `n` = 2 (two '1's)
   - `ans` = 2 + 1 = 3 (cost to shift two '1's to the right of the first '0')
   - Sequence: `0` followed by `00`
   - No additional cost since there are no more '1's
   - **Output:** `3` (incorrect, the correct output is `9`)

The third example indicates an issue with the logic. The correct approach involves considering the cost of shifting all '1's to the right of each '0' in the sequence, not just the immediate transition. The provided logic does not account for the cumulative cost of shifting multiple '1's across multiple '0's correctly.

### Conclusion:
The logic in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost for all cases, as demonstrated by the third example.

**Correctness:** **False**
