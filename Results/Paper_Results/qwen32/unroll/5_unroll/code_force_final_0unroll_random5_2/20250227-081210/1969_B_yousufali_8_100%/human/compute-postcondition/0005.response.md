Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `s` is a binary string provided by the user input.
- `n` is initialized to 0.
- `ans` is the accumulated sum of `(n + 1)` for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `s`**: It is a binary string, which means it consists only of the characters '0' and '1'. The exact value of `s` is not provided, so we cannot determine its specific content.
2. **Variable `n`**: It is explicitly initialized to 0.
3. **Variable `ans`**: It is the accumulated sum of `(n + 1)` for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0'. This implies that `ans` is computed based on the pattern of '1's and '0's in the string `s`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
- `ans` is calculated by iterating through the string `s` and looking for sequences of '1's followed by a '0'.
- For each such sequence, `n` is incremented by the length of the sequence of '1's, and then `(n + 1)` is added to `ans`.
- The value of `n` is reset to 0 after each sequence of '1's followed by a '0' is processed.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example binary string `s = "1101001110"` to understand how `ans` is calculated:
- The first sequence of '1's followed by a '0' is "110". Here, `n` becomes 2 (length of "11"), and `ans` becomes `ans + (2 + 1) = ans + 3`.
- The next sequence is "10". Here, `n` becomes 1 (length of "1"), and `ans` becomes `ans + (1 + 1) = ans + 2`.
- The next sequence is "001110". Here, `n` becomes 3 (length of "111"), and `ans` becomes `ans + (3 + 1) = ans + 4`.

Thus, for the example string `s = "1101001110"`, `ans` would be `3 + 2 + 4 = 9`.

### General Output:
Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the accumulated sum of (n + 1) for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0' in the binary string `s`)**
