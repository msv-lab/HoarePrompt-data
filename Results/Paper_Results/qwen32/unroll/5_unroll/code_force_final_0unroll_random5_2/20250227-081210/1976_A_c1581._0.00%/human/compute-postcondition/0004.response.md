Output State: **password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and each character in the string is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the password; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the password; `last_digit_index` is -1.**

Explanation: The code snippet only initializes `last_digit_index` to -1. It does not change the values of `password`, `digits`, or `letters`.
