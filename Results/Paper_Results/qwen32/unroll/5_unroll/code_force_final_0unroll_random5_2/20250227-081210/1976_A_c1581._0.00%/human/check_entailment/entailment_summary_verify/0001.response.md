Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Recap:
1. Passwords should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit should come after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It processes each test case by iterating `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Password Validation (`func_1` function):**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for checking if a given password is strong.
   - It initializes two lists: `digits` and `letters` to store the digits and letters in the password, respectively.
   - It iterates through each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   - The function keeps track of the last index where a digit was found using `last_digit_index`.
     - If a letter is encountered after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not `-1`), it returns `'NO'` because a digit should not come after a letter.
   - After processing all characters, the function checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
   - If all checks pass, it returns `'YES'`.

### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` checks if a given password string, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, meets specific conditions. It returns 'NO' if there are lowercase letters after any digit or if the digits or letters are not in sorted order. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

### Correctness of the Program:

- **Condition 1:** The program correctly handles the input and processes each password according to the problem's conditions.
- **Condition 2:** The program ensures that no digit comes after a letter by using the `last_digit_index` variable.
- **Condition 3:** The program checks that digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- **Condition 4:** The program checks that letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- **Edge Cases:** The program correctly handles the edge cases mentioned in the problem, such as passwords with only letters or only digits.

### Conclusion:
The program is correctly implementing the solution to the problem as described. The function summary aligns with the behavior of the code, and the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
