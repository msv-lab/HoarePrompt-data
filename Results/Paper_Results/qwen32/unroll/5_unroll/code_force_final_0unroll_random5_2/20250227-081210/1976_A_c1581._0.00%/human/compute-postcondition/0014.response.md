Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `password`, which is a string consisting of exactly n characters (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit. The function returns 'NO' in two cases and 'YES' in one case. Specifically, it returns 'NO' if certain conditions are met (which are not detailed here), and 'YES' if those conditions are not met and an additional condition is satisfied.**
