You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Problem Conditions Recap:
1. Passwords should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit should come after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case by iterating `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Password Validation (`func_1` function):**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for checking if a given password is strong.
   - It initializes two lists: `digits` and `letters` to store the digits and letters in the password, respectively.
   - It then iterates through each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   - The function keeps track of the last index where a digit was found using `last_digit_index`.
     - If a letter is encountered after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not `-1`), it returns `'NO'` because a digit should not come after a letter.
   - After processing all characters, the function checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
   - If all checks pass, it returns `'YES'`.

### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each password according to the problem's conditions.
- It ensures that no digit comes after a letter by using the `last_digit_index` variable.
- It checks that digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The program correctly handles the edge cases mentioned in the problem, such as passwords with only letters or only digits.

### Conclusion:
The program is correctly implementing the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
