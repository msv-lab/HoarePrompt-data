You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input. It calculates a cumulative XOR for the list and uses this to compute a final accumulated value `ans` based on the bit positions of the XOR values. The function prints the original list, the cumulative XOR list, intermediate counts of bits, and finally the accumulated value `ans`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The code contains several issues that prevent it from correctly counting the number of tuples (x, y, z) such that \( f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) \).

Here are some specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The main loop calls `func_1()` without passing any arguments. This function should be designed to handle the input for each test case, including reading the array and computing the required result. However, `func_1()` is not defined to take any parameters and does not return any results.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The prefix XOR array is correctly computed, but it is not used in a way that directly helps solve the problem. The code attempts to use bit counts from the prefix XOR values, but this approach does not correctly address the problem requirements.

3. **Bit Counting Logic**: The code initializes and updates `pre` and `suf` arrays to count the number of 0s and 1s at each bit position in the prefix XOR values. However, the logic for updating these arrays and using them to compute the answer is flawed. The code does not correctly account for the XOR operation and the comparison required by the problem statement.

4. **Answer Calculation**: The way the answer is calculated does not match the problem's requirements. The code attempts to use the bit counts to determine the number of valid tuples, but the logic is incorrect and does not correctly implement the required XOR and comparison operations.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should iterate over all possible tuples (x, y, z) and compute \( f(x, y) \), \( f(y, z) \), and \( f(x, z) \) using the prefix XOR array, then check if \( f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) \). This approach is computationally expensive for large \( n \), so optimizations are necessary, but the current code does not achieve this correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the code that directly computes the answer using nested loops, which is simpler to understand and verify, although not optimal for very large inputs:

```python
def count_tuples(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] ^ arr[i]
    
    count = 0
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        for y in range(x, n + 1):
            fx_y = prefix[y] ^ prefix[x - 1]
            for z in range(y, n + 1):
                fy_z = prefix[z] ^ prefix[y - 1]
                fx_z = prefix[z] ^ prefix[x - 1]
                if fx_y ^ fy_z > fx_z:
                    count += 1
    return count

T = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    results.append(count_tuples(arr))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This code correctly computes the required number of tuples for each test case. However, it is not optimized for very large inputs, and a more efficient approach would be needed for the full problem constraints.
