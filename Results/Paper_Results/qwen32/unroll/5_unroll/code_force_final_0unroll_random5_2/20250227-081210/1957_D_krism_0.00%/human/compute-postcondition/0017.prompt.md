Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer input provided by the user such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `arr_i` ≤ 10^9; `prefix` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point; `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[1, 0]`; `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `[x, y]` contains the count of `0`s and `1`s for the corresponding bit position across the prefix XOR values; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    y = arr[i - 1]
    k = y.bit_length() - 1
    ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
    c = prefix[i]
    for j in range(32):
        if c >> j & 1:
            pre[j][1] += 1
            suf[j][1] -= 1
        else:
            pre[j][0] += 1
            suf[j][0] -= 1


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
