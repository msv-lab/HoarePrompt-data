Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of:
  - An integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 50, representing the number of integers in the list.
  - A list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` where 2 <= k_i <= 20 for each i.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- `N` is an integer read from the input, representing `n` for a specific test case.
- `vals` is a list of integers read from the input, representing the list of `k_i` values for the specific test case.
- `prod` is the product of all integers in `vals`.
- `vprod` is a list where each element is `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
- `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`, and `den` is greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads an integer `N` which represents the number of elements in the list `vals`.
   - It then reads `N` integers into the list `vals`.

2. **Calculating `prod`:**
   - `prod` is calculated as the product of all elements in the list `vals`.
   - For example, if `vals = [2, 3, 4]`, then `prod = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24`.

3. **Calculating `vprod`:**
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - Continuing the example, `vprod = [24/2, 24/3, 24/4] = [12, 8, 6]`.

4. **Printing `vprod`:**
   - The code prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string.
   - In the example, the output would be `12 8 6`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the elements of the list `vprod` as a space-separated string. Each element in `vprod` is calculated as the product of all elements in `vals` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.

Output: **[space-separated values of vprod where each value is prod divided by the corresponding element in vals]**
