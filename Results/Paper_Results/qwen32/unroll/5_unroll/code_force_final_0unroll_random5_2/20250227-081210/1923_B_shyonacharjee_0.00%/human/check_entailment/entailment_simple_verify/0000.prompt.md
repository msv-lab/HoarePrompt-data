You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3 2
    
    1 2 3
    
    -1 2 3
    
    2 1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 1
    
    4 10
    
    3 4 2 5
    
    -3 -2 1 3
    
    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the total number of bullets used exceeds the available time for all monsters, even if some monsters can be killed within their respective time constraints. The program only checks if the cumulative bullets needed exceed the time available for the current monster, but it does not account for the cumulative time available for all monsters.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 5
1 3 2
-3 1 2
```

- **Explanation of the test case:**
  - There are 3 monsters.
  - You have 5 bullets.
  - The healths of the monsters are 1, 3, and 2.
  - The positions of the monsters are -3, 1, and 2.

- **Expected behavior:**
  - The program should calculate if you can kill all monsters before they reach you.
  - You can kill the monster at position -3 in 3 seconds (since it is 3 units away and has 1 health).
  - You can kill the monster at position 1 in 1 second (since it is 1 unit away and has 3 health, but you have 2 bullets left after killing the first monster).
  - You can kill the monster at position 2 in 2 seconds (since it is 2 units away and has 2 health, but you have 1 bullet left after killing the second monster).

- **Program behavior:**
  - The program will sort the monsters by their distance from you: `(-3, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2)`.
  - It will check the first monster: `(-3, 1)`. You have 1 bullet needed and 3 seconds available. It works.
  - It will check the second monster: `(1, 3)`. You have 3 bullets needed and 1 second available. It fails because you don't have enough time to kill this monster, even though you have enough bullets in total.

### Correct Approach:
The program should track the cumulative bullets used and the cumulative time available for all monsters. It should ensure that the total bullets used do not exceed the total time available for all monsters combined.

### Corrected Code (Conceptual):
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
        monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
        total_bullets_used = 0
        total_time_available = 0
        success = True
        for i in range(n):
            (position, health) = monsters[i]
            distance = abs(position)
            total_time_available += distance
            bullets_needed = health
            total_bullets_used += bullets_needed
            if total_bullets_used > total_time_available:
                success = False
                break
        print('YES' if success else 'NO')
```

This corrected code ensures that the total bullets used do not exceed the total time available for all monsters, which is the correct requirement as per the problem description.
