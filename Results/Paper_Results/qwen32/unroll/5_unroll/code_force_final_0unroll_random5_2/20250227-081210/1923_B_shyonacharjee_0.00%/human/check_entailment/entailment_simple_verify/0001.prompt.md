You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine whether the player can survive and kill all monsters based on the given conditions. Let's break down the logic step by step.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and the number of bullets `k` that can be fired per second.
   - It then reads the health of each monster and their positions.

2. **Sorting Monsters:**
   - The monsters are sorted based on their distance from the player (point 0). This is done by sorting them by the absolute value of their positions.
   - Sorting by distance is a reasonable approach since it ensures that the closest monsters are handled first, giving the player the best chance to eliminate them before they get too close.

3. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program initializes a flag `success` to `True` and a counter `total_bullets_used` to 0.
   - It then iterates through each monster in the sorted list.
   - For each monster, it calculates the distance (`abs(position)`) and the time available (`distance`), which is the number of seconds the player has before the monster reaches the player.
   - It also calculates the number of bullets needed (`health`) to kill the monster.
   - If the total bullets used so far plus the bullets needed to kill the current monster exceeds the time available, it sets `success` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without setting `success` to `False`, it implies that the player can kill all monsters in time, and the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach is correct in terms of logic. By sorting the monsters by their distance and checking if the player can kill each monster before it reaches the player, the program ensures that the player is making the most efficient use of the bullets.
   - However, the program does not consider the number of bullets `k` that can be fired per second. The program calculates the total bullets needed and checks if it exceeds the time available, but it does not check if the bullets can be fired within the constraints of `k` bullets per second.
   - For example, if `k = 1` and a monster has health `3`, the program will correctly identify that `3` bullets are needed, but it will not check if the player can fire those `3` bullets within `3` seconds, which is trivially true in this case. However, if the monster has health `3` and `k = 1`, the player can still kill the monster in `3` seconds by firing `1` bullet per second.

### Conclusion:
The program does not account for the constraint that the player can only fire up to `k` bullets per second. This is a critical oversight because the number of bullets `k` is a key factor in determining whether the player can kill the monsters in time.

**Correctness: False**

The program is incorrect because it does not consider the constraint on the number of bullets that can be fired per second.
