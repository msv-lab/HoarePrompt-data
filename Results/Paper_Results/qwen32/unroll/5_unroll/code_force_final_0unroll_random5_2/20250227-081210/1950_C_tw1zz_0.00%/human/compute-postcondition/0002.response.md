Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1440. For each test case, it receives a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm). The function returns the time category for each test case: "morning" if the time is between 05:00 and 11:59, "afternoon" if the time is between 12:00 and 17:59, "evening" if the time is between 18:00 and 21:59, and "night" if the time is between 22:00 and 04:59.**
