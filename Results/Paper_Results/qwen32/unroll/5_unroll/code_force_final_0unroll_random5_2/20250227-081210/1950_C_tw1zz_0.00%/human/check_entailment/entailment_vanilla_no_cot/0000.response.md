Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues:

1. The conversion of hours from 24-hour format to 12-hour format is incorrect for the hour `00`. It should be `12 AM`, but the program outputs `12 PM` for `00:00`.
2. The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to handle each hour, which is inefficient and can be simplified using arithmetic operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        period = 'AM'
        if h == 0:
            h1 = 12
        elif h == 12:
            h1 = 12
            period = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h1 = h - 12
            period = 'PM'
        else:
            h1 = h
        print(f"{h1:02}:{m:02} {period}")

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- The program correctly handles the conversion of `00:00` to `12:00 AM`.
- It uses arithmetic operations to convert the hour and determine the period (`AM` or `PM`).
- The `f-string` formatting ensures that the hours and minutes are printed with leading zeros when necessary.
