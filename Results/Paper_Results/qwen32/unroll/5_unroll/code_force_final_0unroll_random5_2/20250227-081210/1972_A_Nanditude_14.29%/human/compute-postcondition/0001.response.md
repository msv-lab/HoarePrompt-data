Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case is a list containing an integer `n`, a list `a` of length `n` with integers in non-decreasing order, and a list `b` of length `n` with integers in non-decreasing order. The function returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order based on the lexicographical order of the test cases, while each test case remains unchanged.**
