Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to ensure that the difficulty of each problem in the list `a` does not exceed the corresponding difficulty in the list `b`. We can achieve this by inserting new problems into `a` and removing the most difficult problem from `a` after each insertion, maintaining the non-decreasing order of `a`.

### Program Analysis

The program uses two pointers `i` and `j` to iterate over the lists `a` and `b`, respectively. The logic is to check if the current problem in `b` (pointed by `j`) is less than the current problem in `a` (pointed by `i`). If it is, it means we need to insert a problem with difficulty `b[j]` into `a` to adjust the difficulty levels. The insertion is done by removing the last element from `a` and inserting `b[j]` at position `i`. The counter `cnt` is incremented to keep track of the number of new problems inserted.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Insertion Logic**: The code `a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]` incorrectly assumes that `a` is sorted after the insertion. This is not the case because the problem statement requires `a` to be sorted in non-decreasing order after each insertion and removal of the last element.
2. **Sorting Requirement**: The program does not sort `a` after each insertion and removal, which violates the requirement that `a` must remain sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition `while i < n and j < n` is correct, but the logic inside the loop does not ensure the correct sorting and insertion of elements.

### Correct Approach

To fix the program, after inserting `b[j]` and removing the last element from `a`, we need to sort `a` again. However, sorting `a` after each operation can be inefficient. Instead, we can use a more efficient approach by always trying to match the smallest possible `b[j]` with the smallest possible `a[i]` and only inserting when necessary.

### Conclusion

Given the issues with the insertion and sorting logic, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
