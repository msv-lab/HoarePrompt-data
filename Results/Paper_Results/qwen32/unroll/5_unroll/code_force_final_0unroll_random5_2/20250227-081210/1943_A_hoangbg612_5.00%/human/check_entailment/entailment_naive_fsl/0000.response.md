Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the game described. Specifically, the strategy and logic used in the program do not guarantee that both players are playing optimally.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step and identify potential issues:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array `N`. However, sorting the array does not necessarily help in determining the optimal moves for Alice and Bob. The optimal strategy involves both players making choices that maximize or minimize the MEX, respectively, but sorting does not inherently support this.

2. **Building the Dictionary `M`**: The program uses a dictionary `M` to count occurrences of each number in the sorted array. This part seems correct as it is used to track the frequency of elements.

3. **Calculating `cur`**: The variable `cur` is used to track the current MEX. The logic to update `cur` is flawed because it does not consider the optimal moves by both players. The loop that updates `cur` only checks if the current number in the sorted array is greater than `cur` and if it is, it increments `cur` by 1. This does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob are making strategic moves to maximize and minimize the MEX.

4. **Final Check**: The final check `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S` is not clear in what it is trying to achieve. It seems to check if all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present in the array, but it does not correctly account for the optimal moves by both players.

### Example of Failure

Consider the following test case:
```
2
4
0 1 2 3
4
0 0 1 1
```

The correct output should be:
```
1
2
```

Let's see how the program handles the second test case:
- Sorted array: `0 0 1 1`
- The program will set `cur` to 0 and increment it as it encounters each number. However, it will not correctly account for the optimal moves by Bob, who can minimize the MEX by choosing numbers strategically.

For the first test case:
- Sorted array: `0 1 2 3`
- The program will set `cur` to 0 and increment it as it encounters each number. However, it will not correctly account for the optimal moves by Bob, who can minimize the MEX by choosing numbers strategically.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies of both players. It does not simulate the game correctly and does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob are making choices to maximize and minimize the MEX, respectively. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
