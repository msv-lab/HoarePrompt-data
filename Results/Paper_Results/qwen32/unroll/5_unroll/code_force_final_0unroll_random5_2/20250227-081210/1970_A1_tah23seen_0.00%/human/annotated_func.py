    return ans
    #The program returns the string `s` which is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")" with its length not exceeding 500,000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")" with a length not exceeding 500,000. It returns the same string `s`.
