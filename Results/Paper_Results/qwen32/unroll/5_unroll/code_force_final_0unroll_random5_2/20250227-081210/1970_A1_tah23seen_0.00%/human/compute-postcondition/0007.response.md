The code sorts the dictionary `d` by its values. The keys in `d` are indices from 0 to `n-1`, and the values are the balance of parentheses up to each position in `s`. After sorting, `d` becomes a list of tuples where each tuple contains an index and its corresponding balance value, sorted by the balance values.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the balance of parentheses up to each position in `s`.**
