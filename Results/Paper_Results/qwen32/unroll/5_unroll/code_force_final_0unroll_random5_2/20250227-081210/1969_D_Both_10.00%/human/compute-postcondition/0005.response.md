Output State: **The program returns `sub_summ`, which is the initial sum of all `a_i` values plus the sum of `(b_i - a_i) + x_i` for all tuples in `main_ar` where `(b_i - a_i) + x_i >= 0`.**

This means that `sub_summ` is calculated by first summing all `a_i` values from the tuples in `main_ar`. Then, for each tuple `(a_i, b_i, x_i)` in `main_ar`, if the expression `(b_i - a_i) + x_i` is greater than or equal to 0, that value is added to the sum. The final result, `sub_summ`, is then returned.
