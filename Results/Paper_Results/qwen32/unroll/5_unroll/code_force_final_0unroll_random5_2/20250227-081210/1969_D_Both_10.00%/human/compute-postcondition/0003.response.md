The only variable in the loop head is `val_b`, which iterates over `main_ar`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `main_ar` is in a state that allows the loop to execute. Specifically, `main_ar` must contain at least one tuple for the loop to execute.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers, `sub_summ` is the sum of all `a_i` values from the tuples in `sec_arr`**.

To be more precise, we can specify that `main_ar` must have at least one tuple, and we can initialize `val_b` to the first tuple in `main_ar` if needed. However, the primary requirement is that `main_ar` is not empty.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers, `sub_summ` is the sum of all `a_i` values from the tuples in `sec_arr`**.
