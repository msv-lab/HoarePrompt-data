To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to understand the effect of the loop on the variables. The loop iterates over each tuple in `sec_arr`, and for each tuple, it adds the first element of the tuple to `sub_summ`. 

Given that `sec_arr` contains tuples where the first element is the `a_i` value, after the loop completes, `sub_summ` will be the sum of all `a_i` values from the tuples in `sec_arr`.

The initial state does not provide specific values for `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, so we can only describe the final state in terms of the sum of the `a_i` values from `sec_arr`.

Output State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. `main_ar` and `sec_arr` are such that the first element of each tuple in `main_ar` is the difference between the corresponding `b_i` and `a_i` values, and `sec_arr` contains tuples where the first element is the `a_i` value. `sub_summ` is the sum of all `a_i` values from the tuples in `sec_arr`.**
