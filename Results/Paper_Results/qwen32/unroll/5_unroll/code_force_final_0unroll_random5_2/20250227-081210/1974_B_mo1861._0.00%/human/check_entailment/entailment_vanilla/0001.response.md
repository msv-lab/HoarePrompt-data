Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string as per the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to decode a string `b` that was encoded using the described algorithm.
   - The encoding algorithm involves creating an auxiliary string `r` with distinct characters from the original string `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - To decode, we need to reverse the mapping used during encoding.
   - We'll create a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - For example, if `r` is "cdefors", 'c' maps to 's', 'd' maps to 'r', and so on.

3. **Steps in the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.
   - It then calls `func_1(b)` to decode the string `b`.
   - Inside `func_1(b)`, the program:
     - Creates a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them to form `r`.
     - Constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
     - Constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` using the `char_map`.

4. **Correctness of the Mapping:**
   - The mapping created in `char_map` is incorrect. The symmetric character of a character `c` in `r` should be the character at the mirrored position in `r`, not the character at the mirrored position in the alphabet.
   - For example, if `r` is "cdefors", the correct mapping should be:
     - 'c' -> 's'
     - 'd' -> 'r'
     - 'e' -> 'o'
     - 'f' -> 'n' (if 'n' were in `r`, but it's not in this example)
     - 'o' -> 'e'
     - 'r' -> 'd'
     - 's' -> 'c'
   - However, the program incorrectly maps each character to a character in the alphabet based on the length of `b`, which is not correct.

5. **Fixing the Mapping:**
   - The correct mapping should be based on the positions within `r`, not the entire alphabet.
   - The corrected mapping should be:
     - `char_map[r[i]] = r[-i-1]` for each character `r[i]` in `r`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it maps characters based on the entire alphabet rather than the positions within the auxiliary string `r`.

**Correctness: False**
