Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to decode a string `b` that was encoded according to a specific algorithm. The algorithm for encoding involves creating a string `r` of distinct characters from the original string `s` in alphabetical order, then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric character from `r`.

However, the provided `func_1` function does not correctly implement the decoding process. Specifically, the `char_map` dictionary is incorrectly constructed. The function is mapping each unique character in `b` to a character starting from 'a' and incrementing alphabetically based on the reverse order of the unique characters sorted in ascending order. This does not align with the encoding process described in the problem statement.

The correct approach to decode the string `b` is to:
1. Extract the unique characters from `b` and sort them in ascending order to form the string `r`.
2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, etc.).
3. Replace each character in `b` using this mapping to get the original string `s`.

The provided function does not correctly map the characters in `b` to their symmetric counterparts in `r`. Instead, it maps them to characters starting from 'a', which is incorrect.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    # Step 1: Extract unique characters from b and sort them to form r
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(b)))
    
    # Step 2: Create a mapping from each character in r to its symmetric character in r
    char_map = {r[i]: r[-i-1] for i in range(len(r))}
    
    # Step 3: Replace each character in b using this mapping to get the original string s
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    
    return s
```

Given the incorrect implementation in the provided program, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
