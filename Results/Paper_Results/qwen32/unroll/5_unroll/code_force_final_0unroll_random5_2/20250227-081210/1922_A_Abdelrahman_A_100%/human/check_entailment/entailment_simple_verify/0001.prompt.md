You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
1. Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
2. String `c` does not match the template `t`.

### Template Matching Rules:
- If the i-th character of `t` is lowercase, the i-th character of the string must be the same as the i-th character of `t`.
- If the i-th character of `t` is uppercase, the i-th character of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th character of `t`.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Checking if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`. If so, it immediately prints "NO" because `c` cannot be different from both `a` and `b` in every position.
2. If `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`, it iterates through each character of `c` and checks if the character is not in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. If it finds such a position, it prints "YES" and breaks the loop.
3. If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Immediate "NO" on `c == a` or `c == b`:** This condition is incorrect. The strings `a` and `b` can be the same as `c` in some positions but different in others, allowing for a valid template `t`.
2. **Character Comparison Logic:** The logic `if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]` is incorrect. It should check if the characters in `a` and `b` are the same at each position and then ensure `c` differs from that character in at least one position to construct a valid template `t`.

### Correct Approach:
1. For each position `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
   - If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `t[i]` should be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), and `c[i]` must be different.
   - If `a[i] != b[i]`, then we can set `t[i]` to be the uppercase version of `a[i]` and ensure `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`. Alternatively, set `t[i]` to be the uppercase version of `b[i]` and ensure `c[i]` is different from `b[i]`.

2. If for all positions, we can construct such a template `t` that satisfies the conditions, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
