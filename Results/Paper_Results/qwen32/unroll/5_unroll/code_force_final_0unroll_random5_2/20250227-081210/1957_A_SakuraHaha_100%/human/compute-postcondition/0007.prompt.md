Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The output state consists of the integer `t` representing the number of test cases, the integer `n` representing the number of sticks, the list `a` of integers representing the lengths of the sticks, `ans` which remains 0, and `cnt` which is a dictionary where each key is a unique stick length from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that stick length appears in the list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for x in cnt.values():
    ans += x // 3


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
