The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. 

Given the initial state, the variable `n` is already defined as the number of sticks, and `a` is not yet defined. After executing the code, `a` will hold the list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. `n` is an input integer. `a` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks.**
