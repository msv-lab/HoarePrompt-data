The provided code snippet is a function definition and does not execute any code that would change the state of the variables or the program. The function `Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y` is defined but not called, so the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.**
