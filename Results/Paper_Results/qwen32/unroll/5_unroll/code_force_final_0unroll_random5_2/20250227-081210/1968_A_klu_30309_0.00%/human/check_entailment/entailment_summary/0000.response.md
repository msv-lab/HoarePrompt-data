### Reasoning:

The task is to find an integer `y` (1 â‰¤ y < x) that maximizes the expression `gcd(x, y) + y`. The provided program defines a function `func_1(x)` that seems to attempt to solve this problem. Let's analyze the logic of the program.

1. **Initialization**: The variable `max_val` is initialized to 1, which is a valid choice since `y` must be at least 1.
2. **Loop**: The program iterates from `x-1` down to `2` (inclusive). This loop is designed to find the largest proper divisor of `x` that satisfies the condition `2 * y < x`.
3. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, the program checks if `x % y == 0`, which means `y` is a divisor of `x`.
4. **Early Return**: If `2 * y >= x`, the function immediately returns `y`. This is because, in this case, `y` is the largest possible divisor that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` (since `gcd(x, y) = y` when `y` divides `x`).
5. **Update `max_val`**: If `2 * y < x`, the program updates `max_val` to `y`. However, this does not guarantee that `max_val` will be the optimal `y` because the program does not consider the value of `gcd(x, y)` for all divisors of `x`.
6. **Return `max_val`**: After the loop, the function returns `max_val`. Depending on the input, this might not be the optimal `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`.

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- For `x = 10`, the divisors are `1, 2, 5, 10`. The program will check `9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2`. The first condition `2 * y >= x` is met when `y = 5`, so it returns `5`. However, `gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10`, which is indeed the maximum possible value. This is correct for this case.
- For `x = 7`, the divisors are `1, 7`. The program will check `6, 5, 4, 3, 2`. The first condition `2 * y >= x` is met when `y = 6`, so it returns `6`. However, `gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 7`, which is indeed the maximum possible value. This is correct for this case.
- For `x = 21`, the divisors are `1, 3, 7, 21`. The program will check `20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2`. The first condition `2 * y >= x` is met when `y = 18`, so it returns `18`. However, `gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 21`, which is indeed the maximum possible value. This is correct for this case.
- For `x = 100`, the divisors are `1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100`. The program will check `99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 91, 90, 89, 88, 87, 86, 85, 84, 83, 82, 81, 80, 79, 78, 77, 76, 75, 74, 73, 72, 71, 70, 69, 68, 67, 66, 65, 64, 63, 62, 61, 60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 53, 52, 51, 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2`. The first condition `2 * y >= x` is met when `y = 98`, so it returns `98`. However, `gcd(100, 98) + 98 = 198`, which is indeed the maximum possible value. This is correct for this case.
- For `x = 2`, the only valid `y` is `1`. The program will check `1` and update `max_val` to `1`, which is correct.
- For `x = 1000`, the divisors are `1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500, 1000`. The program will check `999, 998, 997, 996, 995, 994, 993, 992, 991, 990, 989, 988, 987, 986, 985, 984, 983, 982, 981, 980, 979, 978, 977, 976, 975, 974, 973, 972, 971, 970, 969, 968, 967, 966, 965, 964, 963, 962, 961, 960, 959, 958, 957, 956, 955, 954, 953, 952, 951, 950, 949, 948, 947, 946, 945, 944, 943, 942, 941, 940, 939, 938, 937, 936, 935, 934, 933, 932, 931, 930, 929, 928, 927, 926, 925, 924, 923, 922, 921, 920, 919, 918, 917, 916, 915, 914, 913, 912, 911, 910, 909, 908, 907, 906, 905, 904, 903, 902, 901, 900, 899, 898, 897, 896, 895, 894, 893, 892, 891, 890, 889, 888, 887, 886, 885, 884, 883, 882, 881, 880, 879, 878, 877, 876, 875, 874, 873, 872, 871, 870, 869, 868, 867, 866, 865, 864,
