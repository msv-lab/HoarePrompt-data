The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a throwaway variable that we don't plan to use. The loop iterates `int(input())` times, meaning the number of iterations is determined by the integer input provided.

Given the state before the loop starts, the only thing we need to adjust is the input that will be provided to the `int(input())` function to ensure the loop executes. Since the loop will execute `int(input())` times, we need to ensure that the input is a positive integer.

The state provided before the loop starts mentions that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. This `t` represents the number of test cases, which is exactly what `int(input())` will read to determine the number of iterations.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the existing state because `t` is already defined as an integer within the required range. The loop will execute `t` times as expected.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
