Output State: **The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `t` remains unchanged and represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the grid is defined by `n` rows and `m` columns, with each cell containing either 'W' or 'B'. The variable `a` stores the grid as a list of strings, where each string represents a row. The strings `first_row` and `last_row` are constructed by concatenating the first and last characters of each row, respectively. The output for each test case is determined by whether all characters in the first and last rows (or columns) are the same and different from each other. If either condition is met, the output is 'NO'; otherwise, it is 'YES'.**
