Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of 'W' and 'B' characters. For each test case, it determines if the first and last rows or the first and last columns of the grid are uniform (all the same character) and different from each other. If either condition is true, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'.**
