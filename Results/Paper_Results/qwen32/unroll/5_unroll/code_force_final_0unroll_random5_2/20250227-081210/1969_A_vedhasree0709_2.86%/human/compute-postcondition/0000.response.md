In the given task, the loop is controlled by the input value `t`, which indicates the number of test cases. The variables `n` and `p` are specific to each test case and are not directly part of the loop head. Therefore, we need to focus on adjusting the state of `t` to ensure that the loop can execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will execute based on the integer value read from the input, which is `t`.
2. **State Adjustment**: To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The problem statement already gives the constraint `1 <= t <= 5000`, which means `t` is already in a valid range to ensure the loop will execute at least once.

Given that the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, and `t` is already within the valid range, no further adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. The variables `n` and `p` are specific to each test case and are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Therefore, the state remains as provided, with the understanding that `t` is within the valid range to ensure the loop will execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000**
