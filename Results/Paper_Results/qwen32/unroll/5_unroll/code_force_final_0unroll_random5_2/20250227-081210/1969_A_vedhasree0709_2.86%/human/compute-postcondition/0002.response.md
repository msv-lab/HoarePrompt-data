The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `p`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and it satisfies the constraint 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, there is an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` is not equal to `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct. 

The function returns:
- Case_1: For each test case, if the conditions on `n` and `p` are satisfied, the function returns a specific value or result based on the problem's requirements (which are not detailed here but implied by the constraints).

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers with specific constraints. The function returns a result for each test case based on these inputs.**
