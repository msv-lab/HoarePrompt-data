To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the logic of the provided code snippet. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, the code reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`.
3. The code constructs a `template` list of length `n`:
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, the character is added to the `template` list as a lowercase letter.
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are different, the character from `a` is added to the `template` list as an uppercase letter.
4. The code then checks if the `template` matches `a` and `b` (`match_a_b`):
   - If a character in `template` is lowercase, it must be the same in both `a` and `b`.
   - If a character in `template` is uppercase, it must not be the same in either `a` or `b` (case-insensitive).
5. The code checks if the `template` does not match `c` (`match_c`):
   - If a character in `template` is lowercase, it must be the same in `c`.
   - If a character in `template` is uppercase, it must not be the same in `c` (case-insensitive).
6. The code prints 'YES' if `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the loop runs `t` times, the output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses based on the conditions described above for each test case. Since the loop does not change the initial values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` outside the loop, the output state will only reflect the results of the `print` statements.

Output State: **A series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each of the `t` test cases.**
