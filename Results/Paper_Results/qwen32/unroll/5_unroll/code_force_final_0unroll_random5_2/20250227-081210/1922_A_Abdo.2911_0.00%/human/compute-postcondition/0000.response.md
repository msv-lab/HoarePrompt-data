The code reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not mentioned to be affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are each of length `n` and consist of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
