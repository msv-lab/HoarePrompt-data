**Reasoning:**

The given program aims to solve the problem by processing a series of test cases, each defined by two integers, `n` and `k`. Here's the detailed breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **For `k < 2`:**
   - The program outputs a sequence of numbers from `1` to `n`.
   - This ensures that only the first cyclic shift (which is the array itself) is sorted. This is correct because for `k < 2`, we need exactly one sorted cyclic shift, and the simplest way to achieve this is by having an array that is strictly increasing.

2. **For `k ≥ 2` and `n == k`:**
   - The program outputs an array where each element is `k`.
   - This ensures that all `n` cyclic shifts of the array are sorted because all elements are equal, making the array trivially sorted in all shifts.
   - This is correct because the requirement is to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts, and if `n == k`, we can simply repeat the same number `k` times to satisfy the condition.

3. **For `k ≥ 2` and `n ≠ k`:**
   - The program outputs `-1`.
   - This is correct because it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `n ≠ k`. If `n > k`, we can't have `k` sorted shifts without having more than `k` sorted shifts. If `n < k`, having `k` sorted shifts is impossible since there are only `n` cyclic shifts.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and adheres to the problem constraints. Therefore, the logic implemented in the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
