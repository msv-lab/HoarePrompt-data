To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem for all possible valid inputs within the given constraints.

Let's break down the problem and the program:

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Sorted Array Definition**: An array is sorted if its elements are in non-decreasing order.
2. **Cyclic Shifts**: A cyclic shift of an array involves rotating the array by a certain number of positions. For example, the cyclic shifts of `[1, 2, 3]` are `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 1]`, and `[3, 1, 2]`.
3. **Requirements**:
   - We need to find an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - If no such array exists, we should return `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Logic for Finding the Array**:
   - If `k >= 2`:
     - If `n == k`, it constructs an array consisting of `k` identical elements, i.e., `[k, k, ..., k]` (repeated `k` times).
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1`.
   - If `k == 1`:
     - It constructs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which is a sorted array.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Case `k >= 2`**:
  - When `n == k`, the constructed array `[k, k, ..., k]` is indeed sorted, and all its cyclic shifts are also sorted. Thus, `k` cyclic shifts are sorted, which satisfies the condition.
  - When `n != k`, the program correctly returns `-1` because it is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k` is less than `n` and greater than 1.
- **Case `k == 1`**:
  - The constructed array `[1, 2, ..., n]` is sorted, and only one cyclic shift (the original array itself) is sorted. This satisfies the condition.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. It ensures that when `k >= 2`, the array can only be constructed when `n == k` and that when `k == 1`, the array is sorted with only one sorted cyclic shift.

Thus, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
