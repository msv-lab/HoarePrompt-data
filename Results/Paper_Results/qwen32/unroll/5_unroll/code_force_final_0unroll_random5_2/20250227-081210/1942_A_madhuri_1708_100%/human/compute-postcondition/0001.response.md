To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the code based on the given conditions.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Logic:**
   - If `k >= 2`:
     - If `n == k`, it prints a list of `k` elements, each being `k`.
     - If `n != k`, it prints `-1`.
   - If `k < 2` (i.e., `k == 1`):
     - It prints a list of `n` elements, which are the integers from `1` to `n`.

### Output State:
The output state will be a series of lines, each corresponding to the output of a test case based on the logic described above. The variables `n` and `k` will vary depending on the input test cases, but the output will be determined by the conditions specified in the code.

### Example:
Let's assume the input is:
```
3
2 2
3 1
4 4
```
The output will be:
```
2 2
1 2 3
4 4 4 4
```

### General Output State:
The output state will be a series of lines, each line corresponding to a test case. Each line will either be:
- A sequence of `n` numbers where each number is `k` if `n == k` and `k >= 2`, or
- A sequence of numbers from `1` to `n` if `k < 2`, or
- `-1` if `n != k` and `k >= 2`.

### Final Output State:
Since the exact input test cases are not provided, the output state can be described in a general form. The output state will be a series of lines, each line being the result of the logic applied to each test case.

Output State: **a series of lines where each line is either a sequence of `n` numbers where each number is `k` if `n == k` and `k >= 2`, or a sequence of numbers from `1` to `n` if `k < 2`, or `-1` if `n != k` and `k >= 2`.**
