To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the approach used in the code and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) between two arrays \( a \) and \( c \), where \( c \) is formed by selecting and arranging \( n \) elements from the array \( b \).

### Approach in the Code:
1. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If both arrays \( a \) and \( b \) contain the same single element, the maximum difference \( D \) is 0 because no matter how you arrange \( c \), \( |a_i - c_i| \) will always be 0.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array \( a \) is sorted in ascending order.
   - The array \( b \) is sorted in descending order to maximize the differences.

3. **Two Pointers Strategy**:
   - The code uses two pointers, one starting from the beginning of the sorted \( a \) and one from the end of the sorted \( b \).
   - It iteratively picks the maximum possible difference at each step by comparing the difference between the smallest remaining element in \( a \) and the largest remaining element in \( b \) versus the difference between the largest remaining element in \( a \) and the smallest remaining element in \( b \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \( n = 1 \), the code handles this separately by considering the maximum difference between the single element in \( a \) and the maximum and minimum elements in \( b \).

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Sorting**: Sorting \( a \) in ascending and \( b \) in descending order is a good strategy to maximize the differences.
- **Two Pointers**: The two-pointer technique ensures that at each step, the maximum possible difference is considered, which is crucial for maximizing the overall difference.
- **Special Cases**: The code correctly handles the case where both arrays \( a \) and \( b \) contain the same single element.
- **Edge Cases**: The code handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \) appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the strategy to maximize the total difference \( D \) between the two arrays as per the problem requirements. There are no logical errors or missed edge cases in the implementation.

**Correctness: True**
