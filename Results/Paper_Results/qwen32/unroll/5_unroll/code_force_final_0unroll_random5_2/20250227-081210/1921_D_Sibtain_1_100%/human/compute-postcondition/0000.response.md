The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the value it takes from `range(int(input()))`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t` provided before the loop starts, which indicates the number of test cases. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.

Given that `t` is already provided and is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself since it directly influences the loop execution count. However, to align with the requirement to only adjust states of objects in the loop head, we need to ensure that the input to `range()` is correctly set, which is already defined by `t`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Since `t` is the only variable influencing the loop execution in the loop head, we adjust it accordingly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100**
