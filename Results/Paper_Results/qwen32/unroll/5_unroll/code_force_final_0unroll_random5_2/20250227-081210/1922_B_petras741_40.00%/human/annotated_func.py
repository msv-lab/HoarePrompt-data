#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `buffer` is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of ways to choose three integers from the list such that they are all the same, plus the number of ways to choose two integers that are the same and one that is different, considering certain constraints. If `n` is less than 3, it prints 0.
