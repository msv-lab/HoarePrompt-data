The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `buffer`. This action does not affect any of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `buffer` is an empty list.**
