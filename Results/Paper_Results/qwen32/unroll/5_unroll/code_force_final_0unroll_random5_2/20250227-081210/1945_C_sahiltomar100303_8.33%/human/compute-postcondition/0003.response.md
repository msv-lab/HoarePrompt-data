Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s. The character `a_j` in the string indicates the preference of the resident of the j-th house: 0 for the left side of the street and 1 for the right side. The function returns the count of residents preferring each side for each test case.**
