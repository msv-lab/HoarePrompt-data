Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is the number of test cases. The other variables (`n` and `a`) are not yet assigned values as the code snippet provided only reads the number of test cases.
