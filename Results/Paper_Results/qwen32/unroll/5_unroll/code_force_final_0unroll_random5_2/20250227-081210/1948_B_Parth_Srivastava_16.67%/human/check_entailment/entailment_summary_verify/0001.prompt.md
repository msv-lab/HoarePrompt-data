You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a list of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 99. It decomposes integers greater than 10 into their tens and units digits, rearranging them if necessary to ensure the tens digit is less than or equal to the units digit. The function then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order. It appends 1 to a list `b` if the list is sorted, otherwise it appends 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code and compare it to the problem requirements to determine if it's correct.

### Code Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code starts by reading the number of test cases `m`.
   - It then iterates `m` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.
   - The results of each test case are stored in the list `b`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - Initializes an empty list `c` to store the transformed array.
   - Iterates over each element in `a`:
     - If the element is greater than 10:
       - It splits the element into its digits.
       - It checks if the first digit is less than or equal to the second digit.
       - If true, it appends the digits in order to `c`.
       - If false, it appends the original number to `c`.
     - If the element is not greater than 10, it appends the element to `c` as is.
   - After processing all elements, it sorts the list `c` and compares it with the original list `c`.
   - If `c` is already sorted, it appends `1` to `b` (indicating "YES"), otherwise, it appends `0` (indicating "NO").

### Issues in the Code

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
   - The code uses modulo and division to split numbers greater than 10 into digits, which is correct.
   - However, it only checks if the first digit is less than or equal to the second digit to decide the order of insertion.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not consider the overall sorted order of the array. For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, splitting `12` into `1` and `2` should not depend on the comparison between `1` and `2` but rather on the ability to sort the entire array after the split.

2. **Sorting Logic:**
   - The code checks if the list `c` is sorted after processing, but it does not correctly handle the transformation of the array into a sorted state.
   - It should simulate the process of splitting numbers and check if it's possible to achieve a sorted array at any point, not just after a single pass.

### Correctness

Given the issues in the logic for splitting numbers and checking the sorted order, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
