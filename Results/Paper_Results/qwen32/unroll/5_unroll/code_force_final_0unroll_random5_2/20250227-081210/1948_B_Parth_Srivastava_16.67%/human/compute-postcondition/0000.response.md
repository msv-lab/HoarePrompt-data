The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `k`. This input does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the list `a`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is such that 0 <= a_i <= 99; k is an input integer.**
