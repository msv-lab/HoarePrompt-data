### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code, the problem description, and the annotations to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if we can sort an array by repeatedly splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits.
- The operation can be performed any number of times (including zero times).

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function processes each element of the array `a`.
   - If an element is greater than 10, it splits the number into its digits and appends them to the list `c`.
   - The logic for splitting and appending digits is flawed:
     - It checks if the first digit (`y`) is greater than or equal to the last element of `c` before splitting.
     - It then checks if the first digit (`y`) is less than or equal to the second digit (`x`) before deciding the order of insertion.
     - This logic is incorrect because it does not consider the overall sorted order of the array after the split.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After processing all elements, the code checks if the list `c` is sorted.
   - If `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to `b` (indicating "YES"), otherwise, it appends `0` (indicating "NO").

#### Annotations:
- The annotations provide a state of the program after processing a specific array `[12, 34, 5, 67, 89]`.
- The annotations show that the list `c` is correctly split into digits and sorted, but the logic within the function is flawed as it does not handle all cases correctly.

#### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
   - The code only checks if the first digit is less than or equal to the second digit to decide the order of insertion.
   - This is incorrect because the overall order of the array needs to be considered, not just the order of the digits within a number.

2. **Sorting Logic:**
   - The code checks if the list `c` is sorted after processing, but it does not correctly handle the transformation of the array into a sorted state.
   - It should simulate the process of splitting numbers and check if it's possible to achieve a sorted array at any point, not just after a single pass.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by repeatedly splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits. The logic for splitting and checking the sorted order is flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**
