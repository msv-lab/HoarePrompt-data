### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine whether a given array can be sorted in non-descending order by repeatedly splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits.

Let's break down the program step-by-step to understand its logic and correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, the array `a` is read and converted to a list of integers.
   - The program then iterates over each element in the array. If an element is greater than 10, it is split into its digits and added to the list `c`.
   - The logic for splitting and adding digits is flawed:
     - The code tries to compare the digits with the last element in `c` (`c[n-1]`), but it does not correctly handle the order of the digits.
     - The code does not correctly handle the case where the first element is greater than 10.
     - The code does not correctly maintain the order of elements in `c` when splitting numbers.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After processing the array, the list `c` is compared with its sorted version `d`.
   - If `c` is equal to `d`, it means the array can be sorted by splitting numbers, and `1` is appended to the list `b`.
   - Otherwise, `0` is appended to `b`.

### Analysis of Provided Execution States:
- The provided states show the execution of the function with an example array `[12, 34, 5, 67, 89]`.
- The expected behavior is to split each number greater than 10 into its digits and check if the resulting array can be sorted.
- The provided state shows that the digits are correctly split and added to `c`, but the logic for maintaining the order and comparing with the sorted array is flawed.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for splitting numbers and checking if the resulting array can be sorted. The logic for handling the order of digits and comparing the array with its sorted version is flawed.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
