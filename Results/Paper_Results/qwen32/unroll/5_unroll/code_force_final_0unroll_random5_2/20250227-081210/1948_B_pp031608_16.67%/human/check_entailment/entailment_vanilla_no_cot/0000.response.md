Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. The function `func_1` is used to check if the list is sorted, which is correct. However, the logic to apply the operation and check for sorting is flawed.
2. The loop structure and the condition to apply the operation are incorrect. The current implementation only checks the condition once per test case and does not repeatedly apply the operation until no more changes can be made.
3. The operation to split a number into its digits is incorrect. The current implementation only splits the number into two parts (tens and units), which is not sufficient for numbers with more than two digits.
4. The program does not handle the case where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_sort_by_splitting(arr):
    while True:
        changed = False
        new_arr = []
        for num in arr:
            if num >= 10:
                changed = True
                new_arr.extend(int(digit) for digit in str(num))
            else:
                new_arr.append(num)
        arr = new_arr
        if not changed:
            break
    return arr == sorted(arr)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_sort_by_splitting(list1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected version repeatedly applies the operation to split numbers until no more changes can be made, and then checks if the resulting array is sorted.
