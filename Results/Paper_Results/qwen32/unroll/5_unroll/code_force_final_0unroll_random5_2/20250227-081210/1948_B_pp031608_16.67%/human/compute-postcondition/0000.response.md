Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99, and the list represents the array a for a single test case with length n such that 2 <= n <= 50; `sorted_lst` is a sorted version of `lst`.**

In this output state, `lst` remains unchanged and still represents the original list of integers. `sorted_lst` is a new list that contains the same integers as `lst` but sorted in ascending order.
