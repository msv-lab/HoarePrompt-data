### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- **Objective**: Determine if an array can be sorted by repeatedly splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits.
- **Operations**: Split an element `x` (where `x >= 10`) into its digits and insert them back into the array at the same position.
- **Output**: "YES" if the array can be sorted using the operation, otherwise "NO".

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Loop Logic**:
   - The program iterates over the list and checks if the current element is greater than the next element and greater than 10.
   - If the condition is met, it splits the element into its digits and inserts them back into the list.
   - However, the insertion logic is flawed. The program uses `a // 10` and `a % 10` which does not correctly split numbers like 123 into [1, 2, 3].
   - The program only makes one pass through the list, which is insufficient because multiple passes might be required to fully sort the array.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the list is sorted. It is correctly implemented but is only called once after the initial pass, which is insufficient to ensure the list is sorted.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split or where elements need to be split multiple times.
   - For example, with the input `[12, 34, 56]`, the program might only split `12` into `1` and `2`, resulting in `[1, 2, 34, 56]`, which is still unsorted.

#### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness**: **False**
- **Explanation**: The program does not correctly handle the splitting of numbers and does not ensure multiple passes through the list to achieve a sorted state.

#### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted by repeatedly splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits. The program only makes a single pass and incorrectly handles the insertion of digits.

Thus, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
