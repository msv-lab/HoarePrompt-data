You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99, and the list represents the array a for a single test case with length n such that 2 <= n <= 50. The function will be called multiple times, each time with a new list representing a different test case, and the number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 10^3.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns True if the list 'lst' is already sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise it returns False.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine whether a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Logic for Sorting:**
   - The program iterates through the array and checks if the array is already sorted using the helper function `func_1`.
   - If the array is not sorted, it checks if the current element and the previous one are in the wrong order and if the previous element is at least 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.

3. **Helper Function:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the given list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version.

4. **Output:**
   - After attempting to sort the array by splitting elements, the program checks if the array is sorted and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Looping and Condition Handling:**
  - The program only checks the current and previous elements once per iteration, which is insufficient. If an element is split, the array might still be unsorted, and the program needs to recheck the entire array.
  - The program does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed or where splits need to be made at different positions.
  - The program does not break out of the loop once it determines that the array is sorted, which can lead to unnecessary operations.

- **Logical Flow:**
  - The program assumes that splitting the first unsorted pair will make the array sorted, which is not necessarily true. It needs to keep attempting splits until the array is sorted or it can no longer be improved.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned, the program might not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations. Therefore, it is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
