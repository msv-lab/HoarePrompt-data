Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine whether a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Logic for Sorting:**
   - The program iterates through the array and checks if the array is already sorted using the helper function `func_1`.
   - If the array is not sorted, it checks if the current element and the previous one are in the wrong order and if the previous element is at least 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.

3. **Helper Function:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the given list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version.

4. **Output:**
   - After attempting to sort the array by splitting elements, the program checks if the array is sorted and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Looping and Condition Handling:**
  - The program only checks the current and previous elements once per iteration, which is insufficient. If an element is split, the array might still be unsorted, and the program needs to recheck the entire array.
  - The program does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed or where splits need to be made at different positions.
  - The program does not break out of the loop once it determines that the array is sorted, which can lead to unnecessary operations.

- **Logical Flow:**
  - The program assumes that splitting the first unsorted pair will make the array sorted, which is not necessarily true. It needs to keep attempting splits until the array is sorted or it can no longer be improved.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned, the program might not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations. Therefore, it is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
