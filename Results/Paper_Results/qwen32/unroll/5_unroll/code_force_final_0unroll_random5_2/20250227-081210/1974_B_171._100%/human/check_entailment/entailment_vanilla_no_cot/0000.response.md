Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly decode the string. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, where it maps each character in the encoded string to its symmetric character in the sorted unique characters list. However, the mapping should be reversed for decoding. The program is currently encoding the string again instead of decoding it.

To decode the string, you need to reverse the mapping process. Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]] = unique_chars[i]
    decoded = ''.join((char_map[ch] for ch in encoded))
    return decoded
```

With this correction, the program should produce the correct decoded strings for the given test cases.
