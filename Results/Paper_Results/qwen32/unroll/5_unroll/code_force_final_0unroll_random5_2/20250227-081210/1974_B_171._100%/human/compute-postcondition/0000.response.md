Output State: **`encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the encoded string, and a string b of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from all strings in `encoded`.**

In simpler terms, `encoded` remains unchanged, and `unique_chars` now contains a sorted list of all unique characters found in the strings within the `encoded` list.
