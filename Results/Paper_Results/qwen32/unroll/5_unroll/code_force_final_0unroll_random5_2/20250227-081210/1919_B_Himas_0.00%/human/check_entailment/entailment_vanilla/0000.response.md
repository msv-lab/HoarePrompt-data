Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting a given array `a` derived from the string `s` of `+` and `-` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length.

### Key Observations

1. **Array Construction**: The array `a` is constructed by replacing `+` with `1` and `-` with `-1`.
2. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty for a subarray `c` is `|sum(c)| * length(c)`.
3. **Optimal Splitting**: The goal is to find the optimal way to split `a` to minimize the total penalty.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's consider the examples given in the problem:

1. **First Example**: `s = "+"`
   - `a = [1]`
   - Optimal split: `([1])`
   - Penalty: `|1| * 1 = 1`
   
2. **Second Example**: `s = "-----"`
   - `a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`
   - Optimal split: `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])`
   - Penalty: `5 * (|-1| * 1) = 5`
   
3. **Third Example**: `s = "+-+-+-"`
   - `a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`
   - Optimal split: `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`
   - Penalty: `(|0| * 4) + (|0| * 2) = 0`

### Program Analysis

Now let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        e = input()
        P = 0
        M = 0
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        print(P - M)
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Input Handling**: The program incorrectly reads the length of the string `s` as an integer `s = int(input())`. It should be read as a string.
2. **Logic Error**: The program calculates the difference between the count of `+` and `-` in the string `s` and prints this difference. This does not give the minimum penalty as described.
3. **Penalty Calculation**: The program does not perform any splitting or penalty calculation as per the problem's requirements.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the program, it is clear that the program does not correctly solve the problem. The program does not implement the logic to find the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the total penalty.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
