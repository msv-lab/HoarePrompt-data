Reasoning:  
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem described. The task is to split the array into subarrays in such a way as to minimize the total penalty, where the penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length. The current program instead calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` for each test case and prints this difference. This does not account for the splitting of the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty as required by the problem statement.

For example, in the third test case of the sample input, the string is `+-+-+-`. The program would output `0` because there are an equal number of '+' and '-' characters. However, the optimal splitting to minimize the penalty would be to split it into `([1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1])` which results in a penalty of `0`.

Correctness: **False**
