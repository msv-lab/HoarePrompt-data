Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` and prints this difference for each test case. However, the task requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` formed from the string `s`.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to implement an algorithm that considers all possible ways to split the array `a` and calculates the total penalty for each split, choosing the split with the minimum penalty. The provided program does not implement this logic and thus does not solve the problem as described.
