Reasoning:  
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task requires calculating the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array optimally based on the rules given. However, the current implementation simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` for each test case and prints that value. This value does not represent the minimum penalty as required by the problem statement.

The program does not perform any splitting or penalty calculation based on the described rules. It lacks the logic to evaluate different possible splits of the array and compute the penalties for each, then select the split with the minimum total penalty.

Correctness: **False**
