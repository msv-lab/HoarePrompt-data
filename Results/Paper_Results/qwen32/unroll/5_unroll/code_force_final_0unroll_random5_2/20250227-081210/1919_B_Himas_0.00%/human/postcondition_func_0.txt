The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (which is not used in the function) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. It then calculates and prints the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` for each test case.
