The only variable in the loop head is `test_cases`, so we can only adjust that one. The loop will execute based on the value of `test_cases`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `test_cases` is greater than 0. The value of `test_cases` is determined by the return value of `func_1()`, but since we are only allowed to adjust the state of objects in the loop head, we need to ensure that `test_cases` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
