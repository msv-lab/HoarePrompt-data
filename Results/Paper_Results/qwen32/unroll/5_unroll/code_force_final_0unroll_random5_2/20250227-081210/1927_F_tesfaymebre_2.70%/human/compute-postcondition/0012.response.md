The code initializes a list named `colors` with `n + 1` elements, all set to `0`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `graph`, `edges`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `node_u`, or `node_v`. The only change is the introduction of the `colors` list.

Output State: **`n` and `m` remain the values returned by `func_3()`, `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory containing `m` edges represented as adjacency lists, `edges` is a list of `m` tuples, each containing a weight `w` and the vertices `u` and `v` of an edge, sorted in descending order by weight `w`, then by vertex `u`, and finally by vertex `v`, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with `n + 1` elements reflecting the connected components after processing all edges, `_min_edge` is the minimum weight of an edge found among the edges that connect vertices already in the same set, `node_u` is the first vertex of the edge with the minimum weight found among the edges that connect vertices already in the same set, `node_v` is the second vertex of the edge with the minimum weight found among the edges that connect vertices already in the same set, `colors` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
