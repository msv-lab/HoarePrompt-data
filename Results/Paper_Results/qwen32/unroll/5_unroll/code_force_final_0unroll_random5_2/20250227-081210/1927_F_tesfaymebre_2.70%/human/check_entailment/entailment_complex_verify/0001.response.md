### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`.
   - It then reads each edge, which consists of two vertices and a weight, and stores them in a list `edges`.

2. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weights. This is not optimal for finding the minimum-weight edge in a cycle but is not inherently incorrect.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - The program initializes a DSU structure to keep track of connected components.
   - It iterates through the sorted edges, attempting to union the vertices of each edge.
   - If an edge connects two vertices that are already in the same component (indicating a cycle), it records the edge and updates the minimum weight of the lightest edge in the cycle.

4. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program correctly identifies the cycle when two vertices are in the same component.
   - However, there is a flaw in the DSU `union` method:
     - The line `dsu.union(u, v, w)` is called even when `parent_u == parent_v`, which is incorrect. The union should not be performed if the vertices are already in the same component.
     - The correct approach would be to update the minimum edge weight in the DSU structure without performing the union when a cycle is detected.
   - The program then performs a DFS starting from one of the vertices in the cycle to reconstruct the cycle.

5. **DFS Implementation**:
   - The DFS function is intended to reconstruct the cycle. However, there are a few issues:
     - The `graph` variable is not defined in the scope of the `dfs` function, which will cause a `NameError`. This is a critical issue.
     - The DFS function should correctly identify the cycle once it detects the second occurrence of `node_v` in the path. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices in the cycle in traversal order.

### Issues Identified:
- **Graph Representation in DFS**: The `graph` variable is not defined within the scope of the `dfs` function, leading to a `NameError`.
- **Cycle Detection Logic**: The DSU `union` method incorrectly updates the DSU structure when a cycle is detected. The union should not be performed if the vertices are already in the same component.
- **DFS Implementation**: The DFS function does not correctly reconstruct the cycle.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, particularly the `NameError` due to the undefined `graph` variable in the `dfs` function and the flawed cycle detection logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
