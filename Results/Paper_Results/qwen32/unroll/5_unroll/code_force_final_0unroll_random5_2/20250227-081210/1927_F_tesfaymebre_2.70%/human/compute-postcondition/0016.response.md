Functionality: **The function `func_6` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in a graph and `m` is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph. The constraints are that `n` must be between 3 and `m`, and `m` must be between `n` and the minimum of `(n*(n - 1))/2` and `2 * 10^5`. The function returns an unspecified output based on these inputs.**
