Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem of finding a simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge in an undirected weighted graph. However, there are several issues with the implementation that make it incorrect for some cases.

1. **Incorrect Union-Find Implementation**:
   - The code uses a `DSU` (Disjoint Set Union) class to detect cycles, but the implementation details are not provided. Assuming a standard union-find structure, the `union` method should correctly merge sets and keep track of the minimum edge weight in each set. However, the code does not properly handle the merging of sets and the tracking of the minimum edge weight.

2. **Incorrect Cycle Detection**:
   - The code sorts the edges in descending order of weight and then tries to detect a cycle by checking if two vertices are already connected. However, the logic to handle the union and find operations is flawed, and it does not correctly identify the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.

3. **DFS for Cycle Extraction**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to extract the cycle once a cycle is detected. However, the `dfs` function does not correctly handle the extraction of the cycle, especially when the cycle involves multiple components or when the cycle is not correctly identified.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the graph is not fully connected. The union-find operations should correctly handle such cases, but the current implementation does not ensure this.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 4
1 2 10
2 3 20
3 4 30
4 1 40
```
The correct output should be a cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge, which in this case is:
```
10 4
1 2 3 4
```
However, the provided code might not correctly identify this cycle due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the union-find implementation, cycle detection, and cycle extraction, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
