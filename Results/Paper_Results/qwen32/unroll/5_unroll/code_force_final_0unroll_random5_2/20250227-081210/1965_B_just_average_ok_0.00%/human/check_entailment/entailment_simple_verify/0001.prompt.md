You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
        
        idx = 0
        
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        
        idx -= 1
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output consists of two lines: the first line is the length of the modified `nums` list, and the second line contains the space-separated elements of the modified `nums` list. The initial state of `t` (number of test cases) and the values of `n` for each test case remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it satisfies the conditions outlined in the problem description for all valid inputs.

### Problem Recap:
1. We need a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
2. There should be no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`.
3. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program generates a sequence using powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^23) and then modifies this sequence to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while ensuring that all other sums up to `n` (except `k`) are possible.

#### Steps Taken by the Program:
1. **Initialization**: The program starts by creating a list `nums` containing the first 24 powers of 2.
2. **Finding the Relevant Power of 2**: It then finds the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
3. **Adjusting the Sequence**:
   - It removes this power of 2 from the list.
   - It adds three new numbers to the list:
     - `k - (highest power of 2 less than k)`: This ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that `k+1` can be formed.
     - `k + (highest power of 2 less than k) + 1`: This ensures that sums larger than `k` can be formed without including `k` itself.
4. **Output**: The program outputs the length of the modified list and the list itself.

### Verification:
- **No Subsequence Sums to `k`**: The program ensures that the specific power of 2 that would allow `k` to be formed is removed and replaced in a way that prevents `k` from being the sum of any subsequence.
- **All Other Sums Possible**: The inclusion of `k+1` and `k + (highest power of 2 less than k) + 1`, along with the remaining powers of 2, ensures that all sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to satisfy the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums up to `n` (except `k`) to be formed using a sequence of at most 25 elements.
