To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the code within the loop for each test case.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `nums` is initialized with powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).
   - `idx` is determined by finding the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - `nums` is then modified by removing the power of 2 at `idx` and adding three new values:
     - `k - nums[idx]`
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`
   - The length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of `nums` are printed.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each test case, the loop processes the input values `n` and `k`, modifies the `nums` list, and prints the results.
   - The value of `n` (the first integer in each test case) is not used in the computations within the loop, so it does not affect the output.

3. **Output**:
   - The output consists of two lines for each test case:
     - The first line is the length of the modified `nums` list.
     - The second line is the space-separated elements of the modified `nums` list.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the output is determined by the values of `k` and the initial `nums` list, the output state for each test case can be described as follows:

Output State: **For each test case, the output consists of two lines: the first line is the length of the modified `nums` list, and the second line contains the space-separated elements of the modified `nums` list. The initial state of `t` (number of test cases) and the values of `n` for each test case remain unchanged.**
