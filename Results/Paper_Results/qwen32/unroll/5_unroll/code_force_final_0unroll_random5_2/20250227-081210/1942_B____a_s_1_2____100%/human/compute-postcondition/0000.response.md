The code provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The values of `n` and the list `a` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies -`n` ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data.**
