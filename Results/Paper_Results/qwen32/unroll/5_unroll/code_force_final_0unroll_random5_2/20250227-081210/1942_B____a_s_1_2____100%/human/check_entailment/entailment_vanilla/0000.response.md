Let's analyze the given problem and code step by step to determine if the provided program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to construct a permutation `p` based on an array `a`, where `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

### Approach to Solve the Problem
The program aims to construct the permutation `p` by iterating from the end of the array `a` to the beginning. The key idea is to use the MEX concept in reverse to determine the elements of `p`.

- Initialize `mex` to `n` (the size of the array `a`).
- For each element `a[i]` in `a` starting from the end:
  - Calculate `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
  - Update `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

### Correctness of the Program
Let's verify if the given program correctly implements the above approach:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `mex` to `n`, which is a valid starting point since `MEX` of an empty array is `0`, and the maximum possible value of `mex` is `n` (when all numbers from `0` to `n-1` are used).

2. **Iterating from the End**: The program iterates from the end of the array `a` to the beginning. This is crucial because the MEX calculation for `a[i]` depends on the elements `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i`, and by iterating from the end, we ensure that we correctly determine the MEX as we build the permutation `p`.

3. **Calculating `p[i]`**: For each `a[i]`, the program calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`, which is the correct formula derived from the problem statement `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

4. **Updating `mex`**: After calculating `p[i]`, the program updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`. This step ensures that `mex` always holds the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in `p` so far.

5. **Output**: The program prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a` using the MEX concept in reverse. The approach and implementation are correct, and the program should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
