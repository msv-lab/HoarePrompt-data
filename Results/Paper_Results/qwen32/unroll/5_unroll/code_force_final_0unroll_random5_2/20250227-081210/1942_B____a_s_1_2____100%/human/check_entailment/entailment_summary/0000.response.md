### Reasoning:
The program aims to construct a permutation `p` based on the given array `a` where each element `a_i` is calculated as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The program does this by iterating from the end of the array `a` to the beginning, calculating `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`, and then updating `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.

Let's break down why this approach works:

1. **Initialization**: The array `p` is initialized with `-1` values and `mex` is set to `n` (the length of the array `a`). The `mex` variable keeps track of the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation `p`.

2. **Reverse Iteration**: The program iterates from the end of the array `a` to the beginning. This is because the `mex` at the end of the array is the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used yet, and it can be directly calculated as `n` (since no elements of `p` have been assigned yet).

3. **Calculating `p[i]`**: For each element `a_i` in the array `a`, the program calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`. This ensures that `a_i` is indeed `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

4. **Updating `mex`**: After calculating `p[i]`, the program updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used in the permutation `p` up to the current index.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the constructed permutation `p`.

The program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` for each test case based on the provided array `a`. The reverse iteration and the logic to calculate `p[i]` and update `mex` ensure that the constructed permutation satisfies the given conditions.
