### Reasoning:

The given problem involves reconstructing a permutation `p` from an array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The MEX (minimum excludant) function returns the smallest non-negative integer not present in the given list.

The provided solution attempts to construct the permutation `p` by iterating from the end of the array `a` to the beginning. It initializes `mex` to `n` and then for each element `a_i` calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`. The value of `mex` is then updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.

Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Initialization**: `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is a valid starting point because the MEX of an empty list is `0`, and as elements are added to `p`, `mex` will decrease.
2. **Backward Iteration**: The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0`. For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`. This calculation is correct based on the definition of `a_i`.
3. **Updating MEX**: After calculating `p[i]`, `mex` is updated to `min(mex, p[i])`. This ensures that `mex` always holds the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.
4. **Output**: The permutation `p` is printed for each test case.

### Verification with Examples:

Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
   - Calculation:
     - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
     - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
   - Output: `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Calculation:
     - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = min(5, 4) = 4`
     - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = min(4, 3) = 3`
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
   - Output: `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 3`, `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
   - Calculation:
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = min(3, 1) = 1`
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = min(0, 2) = 0`
   - Output: `p = [2, 0, 1]`
