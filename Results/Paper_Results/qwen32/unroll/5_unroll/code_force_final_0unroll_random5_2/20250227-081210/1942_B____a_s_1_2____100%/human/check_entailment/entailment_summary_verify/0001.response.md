### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Recap:
Given an array `a` of length `n`, we need to construct a permutation `p` such that for each `i`, `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. Here, `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Key Points:
1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.
2. **Reverse Construction**: The solution constructs `p` from the end of `a` to the beginning, using the current `mex` value and the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`.
3. **Updating `mex`**: After calculating `p[i]`, the `mex` is updated to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is a valid starting point because it is larger than any possible value in `p`.
2. **Reverse Iteration**: By iterating from the end of `a` to the start, the program ensures that each `p[i]` is calculated based on the correct `mex` value for the prefix `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i`.
3. **Correct Formula**: The formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]` is derived directly from the problem statement `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, ensuring that `p` is constructed correctly.
4. **Updating `mex`**: The `mex` is updated to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]` to ensure that `mex` always reflects the smallest unused non-negative integer.

#### Potential Issues:
- **Negative Values**: The program does not explicitly check for negative values in `p`, but since the problem guarantees a valid `p` exists, the constructed `p` should naturally be within the range `[0, n-1]`.
- **Distinct Values**: The program ensures that each `p[i]` is distinct by maintaining the `mex` correctly.

#### Testing:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

**Input:**
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
5
1 1 1 1 1
3
-2 1 2
```

**Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3
0 1 2 3 4
2 0 1
```

For the first test case:
- `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
- Constructing `p` from the end:
  - `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`
  - `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
  - `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`
  - `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
  - `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`
  - `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
  - `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`
  - `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
  - `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`
- Result: `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`

This matches the expected output.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the permutation `p` for each test case by iterating from the end of `a` to the beginning and using the given formula. The approach and implementation are sound.

### Final: **True**
