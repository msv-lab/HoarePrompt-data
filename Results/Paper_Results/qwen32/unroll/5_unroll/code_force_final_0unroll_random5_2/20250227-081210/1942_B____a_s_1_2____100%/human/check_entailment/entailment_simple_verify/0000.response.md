### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness.

**Program Code:**
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)
```

**Annotations:**
- `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is a reasonable starting point.
- The program iterates from the end of `a` to the beginning.
- For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]` and updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

**Original Assessment:**
- The assessment suggests that the program incorrectly updates `mex` and does not ensure that `p` is a valid permutation.
- It provides an example that demonstrates the incorrectness of the program.

**Re-evaluation:**

Let's re-examine the logic and correctness of the program using the annotations and the problem description.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is a valid starting point because the MEX of an empty array is `0` and it can only increase as elements are added.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The program iterates from the end of `a` to the beginning.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

3. **Correctness of MEX Calculation**:
   - The program's logic for updating `mex` is flawed. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the constructed part of `p` up to that point. The current logic might incorrectly update `mex` to a value that is already present in `p`.

4. **Handling of Negative Values**:
   - The problem specifies that `a_i` can be negative, but the program does not handle this correctly. If `a[i]` is negative, `p[i]` could be greater than `mex`, which would not satisfy the MEX property.

5. **Ensuring Uniqueness**:
   - The program does not ensure that the constructed `p` is a valid permutation, i.e., all elements from `0` to `n-1` must be present exactly once.

**Example to Show Incorrectness:**
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
-1 0 1
```
The program will construct `p` as follows:
- For `i = 2`, `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 3 - 1 = 2` and `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`.
- For `i = 1`, `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 2 - 0 = 2` and `mex = min(2, 2) = 2`.
- For `i = 0`, `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 2 - (-1) = 3` and `mex = min(2, 3) = 2`.

The constructed `p` is `[3, 2, 2]`, which is not a valid permutation because it contains duplicate values and a value outside the range `[0, 2]`.

**Conclusion:**

The program does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and does not ensure that the constructed `p` is a valid permutation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
