### Reasoning:

The given Python program is intended to simulate a simplified version of the Quidditch game based on the provided problem description. However, there are several issues and logical errors in the code that need to be addressed to ensure its correctness.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Movement Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the movement of players on the field. However, the implementation is incorrect. The function incorrectly returns `(a + b, a + b)` instead of `(x + dx, y + dy)`. This would cause the player's position to be updated incorrectly, leading to wrong game states.

2. **Incorrect Assignment in Catching the Quaffle**:
   - In the line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]`, the assignment operator `==` is used instead of `=`. This will not assign the player to `quidditch[1]` but rather perform a comparison, which is a no-op in this context and does not update the state as intended.

3. **Incorrect Goal Scoring Logic**:
   - The logic for scoring goals is flawed. The program checks if a player is on a goal cell and then increments the score for the respective team. However, it does not correctly handle the case where a player scores in their own goal, which should result in a point for the opposing team. The code currently increments the score for the player's team in both cases.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Player Elimination**:
   - When a player is eliminated due to a Bludger, the program correctly prints the elimination event. However, it does not handle the case where multiple players are eliminated simultaneously (e.g., if two players are on the same cell as the Bludger). The code should ensure that eliminations are printed in alphabetical order.

5. **Incorrect Quaffle Reset Logic**:
   - When a goal is scored, the Quaffle is supposed to be reset to the middle of the field. The code correctly resets the Quaffle to the middle when a player scores in the opposing team's goal but does not reset it when a player scores in their own goal.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program is not correct as it stands. It contains logical errors that would lead to incorrect game simulations and outputs.

**Correctness: False**

### Corrected Code Snippets:

1. **Fixing the Movement Function (`func_1`)**:
   ```python
   def func_1(a, b):
       x, y = a
       dx, dy = b
       return x + dx, y + dy
   ```

2. **Fixing the Catching the Quaffle Logic**:
   ```python
   elif mo[1] == 'C':
       quidditch[1] = mo[0]
   ```

3. **Fixing the Goal Scoring Logic**:
   ```python
   elif mo[1] == 'T':
       quidditch[1] = ''
       if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
           if mo[0][0] == 'R':
               pointsb += 1
               print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
               quidditch[0] = middle
           else:
               pointsr += 1
               print(i, 'RED GOAL')
               quidditch[0] = middle
       elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
           if mo[0][0] == 'B':
               pointsr += 1
               print(i, 'RED GOAL')
               quidditch[0] = middle
           else:
               pointsb += 1
               print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
               quidditch[0] = middle
   ```

4. **Handling Multiple Player Eliminations**:
   - This requires sorting the players to be eliminated alphabetically before printing the elimination events.

5. **Resetting the Quaffle Correctly**:
   - The existing code already resets the Quaffle correctly when a goal is scored in the opposing team's goal. Ensure that this logic is maintained.

By addressing these issues, the program can be made to correctly simulate the Quidditch game as per the problem description.
