You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains two integers n and k where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}. There are t test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the output consists of `t` lines, each either `1` or `n`, depending on whether `k >= n - 1` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it outputs `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, otherwise it outputs `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is flawed. The current implementation incorrectly assumes that if `k >= n - 1`, Everule can only visit island 1, and if `k < n - 1`, Everule can visit all `n` islands. However, this is not always true.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `3 2`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Explanation: With `n = 3` islands and `k = 2` bridges to destroy, the optimal strategy for Dominater is to destroy the bridges between islands 1 and 2, and between islands 1 and 3. This leaves Everule with only island 1 and one other island (either 2 or 3), so the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is 2.

The current code would incorrectly output `3` for this case because `k < n - 1` (2 < 2 is false, so it would print `n` which is 3).

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the number of bridges that need to be destroyed to disconnect island 1 from the other islands. The optimal strategy is to disconnect island 1 from as many other islands as possible with the given `k` bridges. The correct logic involves calculating how many islands can be disconnected by destroying up to `k` bridges.

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the maximum number of islands that can be disconnected
        disconnected_islands = min(k, n - 1)
        # The number of islands Everule can visit is n - disconnected_islands
        print(n - disconnected_islands)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of islands Everule can visit is correctly calculated based on the number of bridges that can be destroyed.
