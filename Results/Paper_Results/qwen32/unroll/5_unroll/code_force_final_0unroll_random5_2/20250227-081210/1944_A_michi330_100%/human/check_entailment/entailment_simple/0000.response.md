### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of islands Everule can visit if Dominater destroys up to `k` bridges. Initially, all islands are connected, and Everule can visit all islands.

To minimize the number of islands Everule can visit, Dominater should try to disconnect as many islands as possible from island 1. The key observation is that if Dominater can disconnect all islands from island 1, Everule can only visit island 1. To disconnect all islands from island 1, Dominater needs to destroy at least `n - 1` bridges (one connecting island 1 to each of the other `n-1` islands).

- If `k >= n - 1`, Dominater can destroy enough bridges to disconnect all islands from island 1, so Everule can only visit island 1. The output should be `1`.
- If `k < n - 1`, Dominater cannot disconnect all islands from island 1, so Everule can still visit all `n` islands. The output should be `n`.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`. It then checks if `k >= n - 1` and prints `1` if true, otherwise it prints `n`.
