The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable used in `range(t)`. To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `t` is greater than 0 because the loop will iterate from 0 to `t-1`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, `y_i`) are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted in this context.

Given that `t` is already defined as an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it is guaranteed that `t` is greater than 0, and thus the loop will execute.

So, the state does not need to be adjusted further for the loop to execute. The state remains as provided.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
