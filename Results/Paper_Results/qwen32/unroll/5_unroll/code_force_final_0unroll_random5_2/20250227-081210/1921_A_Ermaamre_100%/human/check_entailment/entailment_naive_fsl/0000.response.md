Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program calculates the area of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`) and then squaring this difference (`dx * dx`). This approach does not correctly account for the side length of the square, which could be determined by either the difference in x-coordinates or y-coordinates, depending on how the points are oriented.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
1 2
2 1
2 2
1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

The given program will output:
```
1
```
which is correct for this specific case because the maximum and minimum x-coordinates are 2 and 1 respectively, and the same for y-coordinates.

However, consider another test case:

Input:
```
1
1 1
1 4
4 1
4 4
```

Expected Output:
```
9
```

The given program will output:
``
3
```
This is incorrect because the program only considers the difference in x-coordinates (or y-coordinates), which is 3, and squares it to get 9. However, in this case, the side length of the square is the distance between any two adjacent corners, which is 3, and the area is correctly 9.

A correct approach would be to calculate both the difference in x-coordinates and y-coordinates, and then use the larger of the two differences to calculate the area of the square. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        y = [p[1] for p in a]
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        dy = max(y) - min(y)
        side_length = max(dx, dy)
        print(side_length * side_length)
```

This corrected version considers both the x and y coordinates to determine the side length of the square, ensuring that the area is calculated correctly for all possible orientations of the square.
