### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the key points and the logic of the program. It also notes a potential flaw in the program's logic, which is that it only considers the x-coordinates to determine the side length of the square. While the problem guarantees that the corners form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, this means that the side length can indeed be determined by either the difference in x-coordinates or y-coordinates. Therefore, the program will work correctly for the given constraints and examples.

However, the original assessment suggests that the program could be improved to consider both x and y coordinates for robustness. This improvement would make the program more general and ensure correctness even if the input format or constraints were to change slightly in the future. Despite this, the program is correct for the problem as stated.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
