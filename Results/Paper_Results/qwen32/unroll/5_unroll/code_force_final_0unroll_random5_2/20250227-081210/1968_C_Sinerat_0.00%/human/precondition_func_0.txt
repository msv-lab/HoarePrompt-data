The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the input includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in array a, followed by n-1 integers x_2, x_3, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) representing the elements of array x. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
