Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap
- We need to find an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that:
  - `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `1 <= i <= n`.
  - `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`.

- The input consists of multiple test cases, each with:
  - An integer `n` (the length of the array `a`).
  - `n-1` integers `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program reads the input and constructs an array `a` as follows:
- `a[0]` is set to 500.
- For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is set to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

### Checking the Correctness
Let's check if the program satisfies the conditions of the problem description for all potential cases:

1. **Condition 1: `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`**
   - `a[0]` is set to 500, which is within the range.
   - For `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, since `x[i-1]` is at most 500 and `a[i-1]` is at most `500 + 500 * (i-1)`, `a[i]` will not exceed `500 + 500 * (n-1)`, which is at most `500 + 500 * 500 = 250250`, which is well within the range of `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`.

2. **Condition 2: `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`**
   - According to the program, `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.
   - Therefore, `a[i] % a[i-1] = (a[i-1] + x[i-1]) % a[i-1] = x[i-1]`.
   - This means `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` is satisfied for all `2 <= i <= n`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies both conditions for all potential cases we can think of.

### Verification Against Function Summary
The function summary states:
- The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and `n-1` integers.
- For each test case, it constructs and prints an array `a` of size `n` where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in the input array `x`.

This matches exactly with what the program does, so the summary is accurate.

### Final Answer
The program correctly constructs an array `a` that meets the problem description for all given constraints and examples.

Final: **True**
