You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.

    #State: For each test case, the output is an array `a` of size `n` where `a[0] = 500` and `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- We need to find an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that:
  - `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `1 <= i <= n`.
  - `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`.

- The input consists of multiple test cases, each with:
  - An integer `n` (the length of the array `a`).
  - `n-1` integers `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program reads the input and constructs an array `a` as follows:
- `a[0]` is set to 500.
- For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is set to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

### Checking the Correctness
Let's check if the program satisfies the conditions of the problem description for all potential cases:

1. **Condition 1: `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`**
   - `a[0]` is set to 500, which is within the range.
   - For `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, since `x[i-1]` is at most 500 and `a[i-1]` is at most `500 + 500 * (i-1)`, `a[i]` will not exceed `500 + 500 * (n-1)`, which is at most `500 + 500 * 500 = 250250`, which is well within the range of `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`.

2. **Condition 2: `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`**
   - According to the program, `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.
   - Therefore, `a[i] % a[i-1] = (a[i-1] + x[i-1]) % a[i-1] = x[i-1]`.
   - This means `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` is satisfied for all `2 <= i <= n`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies both conditions for all potential cases we can think of.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**. The program correctly constructs an array `a` that meets the problem description for all given constraints and examples.
