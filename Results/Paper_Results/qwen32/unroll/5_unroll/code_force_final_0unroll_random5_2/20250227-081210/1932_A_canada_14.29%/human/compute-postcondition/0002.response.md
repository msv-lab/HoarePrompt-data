The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `n` for each test case, and `path` which is a string. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 1000). For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the length of the path (1 <= n <= 50), and `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', with the first character guaranteed to be '.'.

The function processes each test case individually. For each test case, the function evaluates the `path` string and returns an output based on the following cases:
- **Case_1:** If the path contains the character '*', the function returns the index (0-based) of the first occurrence of '*' in the path.
- **Case_2:** If the path does not contain the character '*', the function returns the index (0-based) of the last occurrence of '@' in the path. If there is no '@' in the path, it returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a string `path`. It then returns the index of the first occurrence of '*' in the path if it exists, otherwise, it returns the index of the last occurrence of '@' in the path, or -1 if neither '*' nor '@' is present.

It returns the index of the first occurrence of '*' in the path if it exists; otherwise, it returns the index of the last occurrence of '@' in the path, or -1 if neither '*' nor '@' is present.**
