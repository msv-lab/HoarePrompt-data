You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)

    #State: After processing all test cases, the maximum factors for each test case have been printed, and the values of `x` and `n` are as per the last test case processed. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n` (where `1 <= n <= x`). For each test case, it calculates and prints the largest factor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

The program is supposed to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a problemset of `n` sub-problems such that the sum of their difficulties is `x` and each difficulty is a positive integer.

Here is the provided code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)
```

Let's break down the logic:
1. For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
2. It calculates `k = x // n`, which is the integer division of `x` by `n`.
3. If `k == 1`, it directly prints `1` because the smallest possible difficulty is `1`, and the balance cannot be greater than `1` when `k` is `1`.
4. Otherwise, it initializes `ans` to `1` and iterates through possible divisors of `x` starting from `2` (or `3` if `x` is odd) up to the square root of `x`.
5. For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` and `x // i` are less than or equal to `k` and updates `ans` to the maximum value.
6. Finally, it prints the maximum balance found.

Let's consider some edge cases:
- If `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than `1`, the only possible difficulty for each sub-problem is `1`, and the balance will be `1`.
- If `x` is a composite number and `n` is `1`, the balance will be `x` itself.
- If `x` is divisible by `n` and `n` is greater than `1`, the balance can be `x // n` if `x // n` is a divisor of `x`.

Now, let's test the code with some edge cases:
1. For `x = 10` and `n = 3`:
   - The divisors of `10` are `1, 2, 5, 10`.
   - The possible balances are `1, 2` (since `5` and `10` are greater than `k = 3`).
   - The maximum balance is `2`, which is correct.

2. For `x = 5` and `n = 5`:
   - The only possible difficulty is `1`.
   - The balance is `1`, which is correct.

3. For `x = 420` and `n = 69`:
   - `k = 420 // 69 = 5`.
   - The divisors of `420` are `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420`.
   - The possible balances are `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` (since `6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420` are greater than `k = 5`).
   - The maximum balance is `5`, which is correct.

After analyzing the code and testing it with some edge cases, it seems to work correctly for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum balance by iterating through the divisors of `x` and checking if they can be the difficulties of the sub-problems such that their sum is `x` and each difficulty is a positive integer. The program handles all edge cases, including when `x` is a prime number, when `x` is divisible by `n`, and when `n` is `1`.
