Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves two players, you and Nene, who each receive `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards. Each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the deck. The players take turns placing cards on the table. You get a point if the card you play already exists on the table. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The task is to determine the maximum score you can achieve if you play optimally.

### Key Observations:
1. Each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the deck.
2. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
3. You need to determine the maximum score you can achieve.

### Strategy:
1. **Count Occurrences**: Count how many times each number appears in your hand.
2. **Maximize Points**: To maximize your points, you should aim to play pairs of cards (since you get a point for the second card in a pair).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the input, counts the occurrences of each number in your hand, and then calculates the maximum score by counting the number of pairs you have.

### Code Explanation:
- **Counting Occurrences**: The program uses a dictionary `count_a` to count how many times each number appears in your hand.
- **Calculating Maximum Score**: It then iterates through the numbers from 1 to n and checks if a number appears twice in your hand. If it does, it increments the `max_score` by 1.

### Correctness of the Program:
The program correctly counts the number of pairs in your hand and returns the number of pairs as the maximum score you can achieve. This is because:
- Each pair contributes exactly one point to your score.
- Since Nene plays optimally to minimize your score, the best strategy for you is to maximize the number of pairs you can play.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum score you can achieve, given the constraints and the optimal play of Nene.

Correctness: **True**
