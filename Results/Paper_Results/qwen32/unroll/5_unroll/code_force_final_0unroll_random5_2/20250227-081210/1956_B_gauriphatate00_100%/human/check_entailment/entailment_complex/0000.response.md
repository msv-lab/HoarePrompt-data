### Reasoning:

The program's logic is flawed in determining the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. The function `func_1` calculates the number of unique integers in the player's hand that appear exactly twice. However, this does not necessarily reflect the maximum score the player can achieve.

To understand why the program is incorrect, let's revisit the game rules and optimal strategies:

1. **Game Rules Recap:**
   - Each player has `n` cards.
   - The game consists of `2n` turns, with each player taking `n` turns.
   - A player scores a point if they place a card on the table and there is already a card with the same number on the table.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The optimal strategy involves considering the sequence of plays and the state of the table.
   - The function `func_1` simply counts pairs in your hand, but it does not account for how Nene will play or the sequence of plays that would maximize your score.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the first test case:
     ```
     n = 4
     a = [1, 1, 2, 3]
     ```
     Here, the optimal play sequence would be:
     - You play `1` (no point).
     - Nene plays `4` (no point).
     - You play `1` (1 point, since `1` is already on the table).
     - Nene plays `4` (1 point, since `4` is already on the table).
     - You play `2` (no point).
     - Nene plays `2` (1 point, since `2` is already on the table).
     - You play `3` (no point).
     - Nene plays `3` (1 point, since `3` is already on the table).
     - You score 1 point in total.

   - The function `func_1` would return `1` because there is one pair (`1`), but it does not simulate the game to determine the maximum score you can achieve given Nene's optimal play.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` does not simulate the game and does not account for Nene's optimal strategy. Therefore, it does not correctly determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.

**Correctness: False**
