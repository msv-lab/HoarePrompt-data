You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to minimize the number of cards in a hand by repeatedly exchanging any k cards with the same number for k-1 cards with any numbers of our choice. The goal is to determine the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing any number of such operations.

### Key Points:
1. **Operations**: We can repeatedly choose k cards with the same number and exchange them for k-1 cards.
2. **Objective**: Minimize the number of cards left.
3. **Constraints**: 
   - 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 (number of test cases)
   - 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 (number of cards in each test case)
   - 2 ≤ k ≤ 100 (number of cards to exchange)
   - 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 (value on each card)

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
Let's break down the program and identify any potential issues.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the list of `n` card values.

2. **Logic to Determine Minimum Cards**:
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to create a frequency table of the card values, but it caps the frequency at `k`.
   - The logic then checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k-1` if true, otherwise it prints `n`.

3. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The use of `func_1` to cap the frequency at `k` is not appropriate. The frequency table should correctly count the occurrences of each card value without capping.
   - The condition `if k in freq.values():` is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of cards left. It does not consider the optimal strategy for reducing the number of cards.
   - The program does not implement any strategy for minimizing the number of cards based on the frequencies of card values.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Count the frequency of each card value.
- Use the frequencies to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.

The optimal strategy is to repeatedly exchange the most frequent cards until no more exchanges can be made. The number of cards left will be the sum of the remainders when each frequency is divided by `k`.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not implement the correct logic to determine the minimum number of cards left. It incorrectly caps the frequency at `k` and uses an insufficient condition to determine the result.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
