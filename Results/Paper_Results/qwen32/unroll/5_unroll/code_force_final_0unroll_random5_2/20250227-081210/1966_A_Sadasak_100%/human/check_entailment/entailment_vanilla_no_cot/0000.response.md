Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the allowed operations. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Frequencies**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the frequency of each card number in the hand, but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results because the frequency should reflect the actual count of each card number.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Minimum Number of Cards**:
   - The logic in the main part of the program is flawed. It checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k-1` if true, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of cards.
   - The program should repeatedly simulate the operations by reducing the counts of card numbers that have a frequency of at least `k` by `k-1` and increase the count of new cards by `k-1`, possibly with different numbers. However, the provided code does not implement this logic.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cards(n, k, nums):
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Count the frequency of each card number
    freq = Counter(nums)
    
    # Sort frequencies in descending order
    freq_values = sorted(freq.values(), reverse=True)
    
    # Initialize the number of cards
    remaining_cards = n
    
    # Process each frequency
    for count in freq_values:
        while count >= k:
            count -= (k - 1)
            remaining_cards -= (k - 1)
    
    return remaining_cards

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(min_cards(n, k, nums))
```

This corrected program uses a `Counter` to determine the frequency of each card number, sorts these frequencies, and then simulates the operations to reduce the number of cards as much as possible.
