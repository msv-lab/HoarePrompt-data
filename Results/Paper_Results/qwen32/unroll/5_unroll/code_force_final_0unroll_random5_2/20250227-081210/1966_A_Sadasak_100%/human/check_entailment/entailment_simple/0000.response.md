Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the described operations. Let's break down why:

1. **Logic in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` creates a frequency table where the count of each number is capped at `k`. This is not helpful for determining the minimum number of cards left because it does not account for the actual reduction in the number of cards due to the operations.

2. **Logic in the main loop**: After calling `func_1`, the program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table. If it is, the program incorrectly prints `k - 1`. This check is not logically sound for determining the minimum number of cards left. Instead, we need to consider the total reduction in the number of cards based on how many full sets of `k` cards can be exchanged for `k-1` cards.

3. **Calculation of minimum cards**: The correct approach involves calculating the total number of cards that can be reduced by repeatedly exchanging `k` cards for `k-1` cards. This can be done by summing up the integer division of each frequency by `k` and then subtracting this total from the original number of cards, taking into account the remainder for each number.

Here's an example of a correct approach:
- For each unique number, determine how many full sets of `k` cards can be formed.
- For each full set, reduce the total count of cards by `1` (since `k` cards are replaced by `k-1` cards).
- The final count of cards will be the original count minus the total number of reductions, plus the remainders of the divisions.

Given these points, the program as written is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
