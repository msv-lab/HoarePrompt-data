Reasoning:  
The provided program contains a logical flaw in its approach to solving the problem. The function `func_1` is supposed to help in determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the described operations. However, the logic within `func_1` and the main part of the program is not correctly addressing the problem requirements.

- `func_1` is supposed to calculate how many cards of each number are in the hand, but it incorrectly limits the count of each card to `k`, which is not the correct approach. The count should reflect the actual frequency of each card in the input.
- After calculating the frequencies, the program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table, which is not a correct condition to determine the minimum number of cards left. The correct approach involves calculating the remainder of the division of the frequency of each card by `k` and summing these remainders.
- The condition `if k > n` is also incorrect. The number of operations that can be performed is determined by the frequency of the cards, not by the comparison between `k` and `n`.

Therefore, the current program will not correctly compute the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
