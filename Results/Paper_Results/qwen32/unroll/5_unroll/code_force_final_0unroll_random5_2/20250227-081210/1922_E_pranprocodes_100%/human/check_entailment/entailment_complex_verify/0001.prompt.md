You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

            else:

                min += 1

    #State: For each of the t test cases, the number of operations required to reduce x to 1, followed by the sequence of operations (either max or min values) in the order they were applied.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a number of test cases, each consisting of a long integer `X`. For each test case, it calculates the number of operations required to reduce `X` to 1 using a specific set of rules, and outputs this count followed by the sequence of operations applied.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to construct an array of integers such that the number of its increasing subsequences equals a given number \( X \). The key is to understand how the number of increasing subsequences is generated by the structure of the array.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses a greedy approach to generate an array based on the binary representation of \( X \). Here is a detailed step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `max` and `min` to large positive and negative values, respectively.
   - It also initializes an empty list `ans` to store the array and a counter `t` to keep track of the length of the array.

2. **While Loop**:
   - The loop continues until \( X \) becomes 1.
   - If \( X \) is even, it appends `max` to the array, decrements `max`, and divides \( X \) by 2.
   - If \( X \) is odd, it appends `min` to the array, increments `min`, and subtracts 1 from \( X \).
   - This process effectively converts \( X \) into a binary representation, where each bit corresponds to an element in the array.

3. **Reversing the Array**:
   - After the loop, the array `ans` is reversed. This step is crucial because the binary representation is constructed in reverse order.

4. **Output**:
   - The length of the array `t` is printed.
   - The elements of the array `ans` are printed.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program attempts to generate an array based on the binary representation of \( X \), but it does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly \( X \).
- The key issue is that the program does not correctly map the binary representation to the number of increasing subsequences. Specifically, the binary representation does not inherently correspond to the number of increasing subsequences in a way that guarantees the correct count.
- For example, if \( X = 5 \), the binary representation is `101`. The program would generate an array like `[min, max, min]` (or similar), but this does not necessarily result in exactly 5 increasing subsequences.
- The problem requires a more sophisticated approach to construct the array, such as using a combination of elements that generate the correct number of increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It attempts to use a binary representation to generate the array, but this approach does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
