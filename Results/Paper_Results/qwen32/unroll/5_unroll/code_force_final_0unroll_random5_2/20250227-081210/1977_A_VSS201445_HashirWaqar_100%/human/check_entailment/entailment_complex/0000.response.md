### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube. The key observation here is that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` must be even for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes. This is because each pair of "add a cube" and "remove a cube" operations results in no net change, and if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, the remaining moves (after potentially reaching `m` cubes) must be able to cancel each other out in pairs.

The given program correctly implements this logic. For each test case, it checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
