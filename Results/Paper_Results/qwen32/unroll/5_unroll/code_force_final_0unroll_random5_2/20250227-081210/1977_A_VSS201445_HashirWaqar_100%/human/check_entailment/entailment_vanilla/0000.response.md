Reasoning:
To determine if it is possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to consider the nature of the operations he can perform. Each move can either add or remove exactly one cube from the tower.

1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Operations**: Each move can either increase or decrease the number of cubes in the tower by 1.
3. **Final State**: We need to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Given these points, let's analyze the conditions under which it is possible to end up with `m` cubes:

- **Total Change**: The total change in the number of cubes after `n` moves can be any even number between -n and n (inclusive). This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and thus, the net effect after an even number of moves can be zero, and after an odd number of moves, the net effect can be any odd number.
- **Specific Condition**: To end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference between the number of add operations and the number of remove operations must be `m`. This difference must be achievable within `n` moves, which means `m` must be within the range of possible net changes, i.e., -n to n.
- **Parity Check**: Since each move changes the number of cubes by 1, the parity (odd or even nature) of the final number of cubes (`m`) must match the parity of the number of moves (`n`). This is because an even number of moves can only result in an even net change, and an odd number of moves can only result in an odd net change.

Given these points, the condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` in the provided program is not entirely correct. The correct condition should be `n >= abs(m) and (n - abs(m)) % 2 == 0` to account for the possibility of `m` being negative (which is not the case here as per the problem statement, but we should consider the absolute value for completeness).

However, the given program works correctly for the problem as stated because `m` is always non-negative, and the condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` correctly checks if the final number of cubes can be achieved with the given number of moves.

Thus, the program is correct based on the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
