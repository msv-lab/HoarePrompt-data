### Reasoning:

The problem revolves around a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The goal is to determine if Alice will win if both players play optimally.

The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ("U"). Here's why:

1. **Odd Number of "U" Coins:**
   - If the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he faces an even number of "U" coins at the start of his turn.
   - By making the number of "U" coins even at the start of Bob's turn, Alice ensures that Bob will eventually be the one to face a single "U" coin, which he will lose on.

2. **Even Number of "U" Coins:**
   - If the number of "U" coins is even, Bob can always force Alice into a position where she faces an odd number of "U" coins at the start of her turn.
   - By making the number of "U" coins odd at the start of Alice's turn, Bob ensures that Alice will eventually be the one to face a single "U" coin, which she will lose on.

Thus, the game's outcome can be determined simply by counting the number of "U" coins and checking if it is odd or even.

### Program Analysis:

The provided program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of "U" coins in each test case and checking if it is odd or even. If the count is odd, it appends 'yes' to the results indicating Alice's win; otherwise, it appends 'no' indicating Bob's win.

The program reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results in the correct format.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

**Correctness: True**
