### Reasoning:

To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules. Let's break down the logic used in the provided program:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price).

2. **Determine `k`**: The variable `k` is calculated as `min(n, b - a)`. This represents the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price. If `b - a` is less than `n`, then `k` will be `b - a` because selling more than `b - a` buns at the modified price would not make sense (since the price would drop below `a` and it's better to sell them at `a`).

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, then it's always better to sell all buns at the usual price `a`, since the modified price would not be beneficial. The profit in this case is `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, the program calculates the profit using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \left(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2}\right) * k + (n - k) * a
     \]
     This formula calculates the sum of the arithmetic series for the first `k` buns sold at the modified price and adds the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

Let's verify the provided program with the example cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
  - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
  - Since `b > a`, use the formula:
    \[
    \text{Profit} = \left(\frac{(5 + (5 - 1 + 1))}{2}\right) * 1 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17
    \]
  - The output matches the expected result.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 4`
  - Since `b > a`, use the formula:
    \[
    \text{Profit} = \left(\frac{(9 + (9 - 4 + 1))}{2}\right) * 4 + (5 - 4) * 5 = 20 + 5 = 35
    \]
  - The output matches the expected result.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
  - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
  - Since `b <= a`, the profit is `10 * 10 = 100`.
  - The output matches the expected result.

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
  - Since `b > a`, use the formula:
    \[
    \text{Profit} = \left(\frac{(11 + (11 - 5 + 1))}{2}\right) * 5 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45
    \]
  - The output matches the expected result.

- **Test Case 5**: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
  - `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0`
  - Since `b <= a`, the profit is `1000000000 * 1000000000`.
  - The output matches the expected result.

- **Test Case 6**: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1`
  - `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = 0`
  - Since `b <= a`, the profit is `1000000000 * 1000000000`.
  - The output matches the expected result.

- **Test Case 7**: `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
  - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
  - Since `b > a`, use the formula:
    \[
    \text{Profit} = \left(\frac{(1000 + (1000 - 999 + 1))}{2}\right) * 999 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 500500
    \]
  - The output matches the expected result.

The program handles all the test cases correctly and efficiently, adhering to the problem constraints.
