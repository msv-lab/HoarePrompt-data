You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers, and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of list.
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: The list will have modified values with many elements potentially reduced to 0, and some elements adjusted based on the reductions. The exact state depends on the initial values of the list.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list will have modified values with many elements potentially reduced to 0, and some elements adjusted based on the reductions. The exact state depends on the initial values of the list. The function `func_1(list, n)` is evaluated, and it can either return True or False.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `list`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and `n`, which is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of `list`. The function returns a specific value or performs a specific operation based on the elements of the list and its length.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
