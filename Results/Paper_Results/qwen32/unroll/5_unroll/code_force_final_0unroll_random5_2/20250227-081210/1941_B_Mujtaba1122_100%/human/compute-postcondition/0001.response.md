To determine the output state, let's analyze the given loop and its effects on the list.

The loop iterates over the list from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive). For each element at index `i`, it enters a `while` loop that continues as long as:
- The element at index `i` is greater than 1.
- The element at index `i-1` is greater than 0.
- The element at index `i+1` is greater than 0.

Inside the `while` loop:
- The element at index `i+1` is decremented by the value of the element at index `i-1`.
- The element at index `i` is decremented by twice the value of the element at index `i-1`.
- The element at index `i-1` is decremented by its own value (i.e., set to 0).

After the `while` loop, if the element at index `i-1` is not 0, the function prints 'no' and returns, indicating that the loop terminates early.

Given these operations, the loop aims to reduce the values in the list, particularly focusing on reducing the value at `i-1` to 0 while adjusting the values at `i` and `i+1` accordingly. If at any point, `i-1` is not reduced to 0, the function terminates early by printing 'no'.

### Key Observations:
1. **Early Termination**: The loop can terminate early if any `list[i-1]` is not reduced to 0 after the `while` loop. This means the output state can be influenced by the values in the list and their interactions.
2. **Reduction of Elements**: The primary reduction happens at `i-1`, with corresponding adjustments at `i` and `i+1`.

### Output State Analysis:
- If the loop completes all iterations without printing 'no', it means every `list[i-1]` was successfully reduced to 0 during the `while` loop.
- The final state of the list will depend on the initial values and how they interact during the reductions.

Since the exact initial values of the list are not provided, we can't determine the exact final values of the list. However, we can describe the general state:

- **All `list[i-1]` values are 0**: This is a necessary condition for the loop to complete without printing 'no'.
- **Values at `i` and `i+1` are adjusted based on the reductions**: The exact values depend on the initial values and the interactions during the loop.

Given the nature of the operations, the list will have a modified form where many elements might be reduced, and some might remain unchanged if they were not involved in the reductions.

### Final Output State:
Since we don't have specific initial values, we can't provide exact numbers, but we can describe the state in a general form.

Output State: **The list will have modified values with many elements potentially reduced to 0, and some elements adjusted based on the reductions. The exact state depends on the initial values of the list.**
