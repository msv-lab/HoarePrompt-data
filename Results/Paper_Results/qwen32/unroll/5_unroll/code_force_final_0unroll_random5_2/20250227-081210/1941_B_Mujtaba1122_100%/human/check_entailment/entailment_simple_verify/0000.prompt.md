You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 3 5 5 2
    
    5
    
    2 4 4 5 1
    
    5
    
    0 1 3 3 1
    
    6
    
    5 6 0 2 3 0
    
    4
    
    1 2 7 2
    
    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`:**
   - The loop in `func_2` iterates over the array from index 1 to `n-2` (inclusive).
   - Inside the loop, the while condition checks if `list[i] > 1` and `list[i - 1] > 0` and `list[i + 1] > 0`. This condition is too restrictive. The operation can be performed as long as `list[i] >= 2` and `list[i - 1] >= 1` and `list[i + 1] >= 1`.
   - The operation inside the while loop is incorrect. It should decrement `list[i + 1]` by 1, `list[i]` by 2, and `list[i - 1]` by 1, not by `list[i - 1]`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array cannot be made zero using the described operations. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 7, 2]`, the program will incorrectly return "NO" because it does not correctly simulate the operations.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The program prints "NO" as soon as it finds a non-zero element in the array after the loop, which is incorrect. It should only print "NO" after checking the entire array.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:

Consider the test case:
```
4
1 2 7 2
```

The correct output should be "NO" because it is impossible to make all elements zero using the described operations. However, the provided program will incorrectly return "YES" or "NO" based on its flawed logic.

### Correct Implementation:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_zero(arr, n):
    if n < 3:
        return False
    
    # Normalize the array by performing the operation as much as possible
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while arr[i] >= 2 and arr[i - 1] >= 1 and arr[i + 1] >= 1:
            arr[i + 1] -= 1
            arr[i] -= 2
            arr[i - 1] -= 1
    
    # Check if all elements are zero
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, input[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        if can_make_zero(arr, n):
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# main()
```

This corrected implementation correctly simulates the operations and checks if all elements can be made zero.
