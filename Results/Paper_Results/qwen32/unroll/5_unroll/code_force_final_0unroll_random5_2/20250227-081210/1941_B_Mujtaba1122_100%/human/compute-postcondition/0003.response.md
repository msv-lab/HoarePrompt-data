The provided initial state and the Python code snippet do not contain any variables, objects, or conditions that affect the output of the `print` statement. The code simply prints the string 'YES'. 

Given that `func_1(list, n)` evaluates to True, it suggests that some condition or operation within the function `func_1` is satisfied, but this does not influence the output of the `print` statement in any way.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be exactly the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
