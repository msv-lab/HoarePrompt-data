You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list).
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: list is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list).
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function checks if the first `n` elements of the input list are all zeros. If any of these elements is not zero, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers, and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of list.
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: The list will have modified values with many elements potentially reduced to 0, and some elements adjusted based on the reductions. The exact state depends on the initial values of the list.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list will have modified values with many elements potentially reduced to 0, and some elements adjusted based on the reductions. The exact state depends on the initial values of the list. The function `func_1(list, n)` is evaluated, and it can either return True or False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` modifies a list of non-negative integers by reducing certain elements based on specific conditions. It prints 'no' if any element at position `i-1` is not zero after a series of adjustments. If all elements at position `i-1` are zero, it calls another function `func_1` to determine if the final state of the list meets a certain condition, printing 'YES' if true and 'NO' if false. The final state of the program depends on the initial values of the list and the outcome of `func_1`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - It iterates through the array and returns `False` if any element is not zero. Otherwise, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correctly implemented to check if all elements are zero.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to make all elements of the array zero by applying the described operation.
   - The loop iterates through the array from the second element to the second last element (i.e., `for i in range(1, n - 1)`).
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `list[i]` is greater than 1 and if the adjacent elements `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - If the conditions are met, it performs the operation: 
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - However, there is a logical flaw in the operation logic. The operation should decrement `list[i+1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i-1]` by 1, 2, and 1, respectively, not by multiples of `list[i-1]`.
   - After the loop, it checks if all elements are zero using `func_1`. If they are, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

3. **Flaw in the Operation Logic**:
   - The operation logic in `func_2` is incorrect. It should decrement the elements by fixed values (1, 2, 1) rather than by multiples of `list[i-1]`. This means the current implementation does not correctly simulate the operation described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the operation simulation within `func_2`.
