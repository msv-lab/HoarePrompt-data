Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to compute the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n` for multiple test cases. The input consists of `t` test cases, each containing a single integer `n`. For each `n`, the program should output the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`.

### Program Analysis
Here's the provided Python code:

```python
soma = 0
N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))
```

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Initialization of `soma`**:
   - The variable `soma` is initialized only once before the loop over test cases. This means that the sum from all test cases will be accumulated in the same variable, leading to incorrect results for multiple test cases.

2. **Incorrect Range in the Inner Loop**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` should iterate from 1 to `n` inclusive, but it currently iterates from 0 to `n-1`. This means that the digit sum of `n` is not included in the sum.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final `soma` after all test cases, but it should print the result for each test case separately.

### Corrected Approach
To fix the program, we need to:
- Reset `soma` for each test case.
- Adjust the range to include `n`.
- Print the result for each test case separately.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0  # Reset soma for each test case
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Include n in the range
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)  # Print the result for each test case
```

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
