You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if total % n != 0:
        return 'NO'
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists `nums`, where each inner list contains integers representing the amounts of water in containers for different test cases. It checks if it is possible to redistribute the water in each test case such that all containers have the same amount of water. If redistribution is possible for all test cases, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` containers with water, each containing `a_i` units of water.
- The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
- We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
- The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

### Key Observations:
1. **Equal Distribution Requirement**:
   - For the containers to have the same amount of water, each container should have `mean = total_sum / n` units of water.
   
2. **Operation Constraint**:
   - We can only pour water from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index. This implies that once water is poured into a container, it cannot be poured back out to a container with a lower index.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. **Calculate the Mean**:
   - The mean amount of water each container should have is `total_sum / n`.

2. **Check Balance**:
   - It then iterates through the list of containers, maintaining a running total (`curr`) of the difference between the current container's water and the mean.
   - If at any point the running total `curr` becomes negative, it returns "NO". This suggests that the program is checking if it's possible to balance the water without ever needing to pour water "backwards" (i.e., from a higher index to a lower index).

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Positive Running Total (`curr`)**:
  - The program ensures that the running total `curr` never goes negative. This means that by the time we reach any container `j`, we should have enough water in the previously considered containers (from `1` to `j-1`) to balance the water up to container `j`.
  
- **Final Check**:
  - If the running total `curr` is never negative, it means we can pour water from lower-indexed containers to higher-indexed containers in such a way that all containers end up with the mean amount of water.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If all containers already have the mean amount of water, the program will return "YES".
  - If the sum of water in the first `k` containers is less than `k * mean` at any point, the program will return "NO", which is correct because it means we can't balance the water without violating the operation constraint.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water under the given constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
