Let's carefully analyze the problem, the provided code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Analysis

The problem states that we need to determine if it is possible to redistribute water among containers such that each container ends up with the same amount of water. The key points are:
1. The total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers.
2. Water can only be poured from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.

### Provided Code Analysis

The code reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calls the function `func_1` with the list of container amounts. The function `func_1` checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (which is already guaranteed by the problem statement). Then, it calculates the mean amount of water each container should have and iterates through the list to check if it is possible to redistribute the water as per the given constraints.

Here is the function `func_1` again for reference:
```python
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if total % n != 0:
        return 'NO'
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

### Function Summary Analysis

The function summary is slightly inaccurate as it mentions that `func_1` accepts a list of lists, but the code actually passes a single list for each test case. The summary correctly states the purpose of the function, which is to determine if it is possible to redistribute the water such that all containers have the same amount of water.

### Original Assessment Analysis

The original assessment claims that the provided program is incorrect due to the `if curr < 0` check. Let's analyze this in detail:

1. **Mean Calculation**: The mean amount of water each container should have is calculated correctly as `total // n`.
2. **Cumulative Difference (`curr`)**: The variable `curr` keeps track of the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target mean. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that the current container has less water than the target mean and there is not enough water in the previous containers to compensate for this deficit, making it impossible to redistribute the water as required.

The check `if curr < 0` is indeed correct. If `curr` becomes negative, it signifies that we cannot redistribute the water such that all containers have the same amount of water because there is a deficit that cannot be filled by the subsequent containers.

### Counterexample Analysis

Let's revisit the counterexample provided in the original assessment:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The total amount of water is 6, and the mean is 2.
- We can redistribute the water as follows:
  - Pour 1 unit from the third container to the first container: [2, 2, 2].

However, the original assessment incorrectly claims that the provided program returns 'NO' for this input. Let's verify:

- `total = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`
- `mean = total // 3 = 2`
- Iteration:
  - `i = 0`: `curr = 1 - 2 = -1` → `curr < 0` → Return 'NO'

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program would return 'NO' for this input, which is indeed incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying a flaw in the program.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis above, the provided program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the `if curr < 0` check. The program does not correctly handle the redistribution logic, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

Final: **False**
