### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to redistribute the water in such a way that all containers have the same amount of water. Given the constraints and the operation allowed (pouring water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`), we need to check if the water can be evenly distributed.

The logic in the function `func_1` is as follows:
1. **Calculate the mean**: The mean amount of water per container is calculated by dividing the total amount of water by the number of containers.
2. **Check the cumulative difference**: As we iterate through the containers, we keep a running total (`curr`) of the difference between the current container's water and the mean. If at any point this running total becomes negative, it means that the current container cannot be balanced out by the previous containers, and we return 'NO'.
3. **Return 'YES' if no negative cumulative difference is found**: If we finish iterating through all containers without the running total going negative, it means that the water can be redistributed evenly, and we return 'YES'.

The key insight here is that if the cumulative difference (`curr`) ever goes negative, it indicates that the water in the current container is not enough to balance out the previous containers, given the allowed operation (pouring water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`). If the cumulative difference never goes negative, it means that the water can be redistributed such that all containers end up with the mean amount of water.

### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_1` correctly implements this logic. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotated states.
