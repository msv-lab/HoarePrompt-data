You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, and `i` will be equal to `t`. The state of `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum of the three integers, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly handles the case where `a == b` or `b == c` but not both, which should still be classified as either "STAIR" or "PEAK" based on the given conditions.

Here is a specific case that demonstrates the issue:

**Input:**
```
2
1 1 2
2 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NONE
NONE
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NONE
PEAK
```

In the first test case, `a == b` (1 == 1) and `b < c` (1 < 2), but the program incorrectly prints "NONE" instead of "STAIR" because of the condition `elif a == b == c:` which does not cover the scenario where only `a == b` or `b == c`.

In the second test case, `a < b` (2 < 3) and `b == c` (3 == 3), but the program incorrectly prints "PEAK" instead of "NONE" because it only checks if `max(a, b, c) == b` without considering the equality conditions properly.

To fix this, the conditions should be adjusted to correctly handle these cases. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a > b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This version correctly checks for the "STAIR" and "PEAK" conditions without incorrectly handling cases where two numbers are equal.
