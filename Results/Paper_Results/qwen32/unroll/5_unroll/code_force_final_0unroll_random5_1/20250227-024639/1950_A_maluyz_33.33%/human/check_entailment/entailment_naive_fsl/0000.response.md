Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly handles the case where `a == b` or `b == c` but not both, which should still be classified as either "STAIR" or "PEAK" based on the given conditions.

Here is a specific case that demonstrates the issue:

**Input:**
```
2
1 1 2
2 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NONE
NONE
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NONE
PEAK
```

In the first test case, `a == b` (1 == 1) and `b < c` (1 < 2), but the program incorrectly prints "NONE" instead of "STAIR" because of the condition `elif a == b == c:` which does not cover the scenario where only `a == b` or `b == c`.

In the second test case, `a < b` (2 < 3) and `b == c` (3 == 3), but the program incorrectly prints "PEAK" instead of "NONE" because it only checks if `max(a, b, c) == b` without considering the equality conditions properly.

To fix this, the conditions should be adjusted to correctly handle these cases. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a > b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This version correctly checks for the "STAIR" and "PEAK" conditions without incorrectly handling cases where two numbers are equal.
