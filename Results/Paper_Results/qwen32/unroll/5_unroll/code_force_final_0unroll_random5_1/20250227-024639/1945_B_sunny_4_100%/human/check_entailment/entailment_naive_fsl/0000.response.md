Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The current implementation simply adds the number of fireworks from each installation plus 2, which is not the correct logic to solve the problem.

Let's analyze the logic required:

1. **Fireworks from the first installation**: These are launched every `a` minutes, and each lasts for `m + 1` minutes.
2. **Fireworks from the second installation**: These are launched every `b` minutes, and each lasts for `m + 1` minutes.
3. **Overlap**: We need to consider the overlap of fireworks from both installations to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

The provided code does not account for the overlap between the fireworks from the two installations. It simply adds the number of fireworks from each installation and adds 2, which is incorrect.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate why the code is incorrect:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2 3
```
**Expected Output:**
```
4
```
**Explanation:**
- Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times 0, 2, 4, 6, ...
- Fireworks from the second installation are launched at times 0, 2, 4, 6, ...
- Each firework lasts for 4 minutes (3 + 1).

At time 0, both fireworks are visible.
At time 2, both fireworks are visible.
At time 4, both fireworks are visible.
At time 6, both fireworks are visible.

So, at any given time from 0 to 6, there are 4 fireworks visible (two from each installation).

However, the provided code will output `4 // 2 + 4 // 2 + 2 = 6`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program is incorrect due to not handling the overlap of fireworks correctly.
