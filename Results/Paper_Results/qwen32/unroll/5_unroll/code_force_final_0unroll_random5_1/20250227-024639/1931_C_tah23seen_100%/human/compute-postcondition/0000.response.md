Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`. The function is called once for each test case, and the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `i` is 0.**

In simple terms, the list `arr` remains unchanged, and a new variable `i` is initialized to 0. All other conditions and constraints remain the same.
