Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description. The main issue is that the program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. The program reads the number of test cases but then incorrectly sums up the results of all test cases into a single variable `soma` and prints it only once after processing all test cases. This means the output will not be separated for each test case as required by the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. The program initializes `soma` outside the loop over test cases, which means it accumulates results from all test cases into one sum.
2. The program prints the final `soma` only once after processing all test cases, instead of printing the result for each test case separately.

To fix the program, you should initialize `soma` inside the loop for each test case and print the result for each test case immediately after processing it.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Start from 1 instead of 0
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

This corrected version initializes `soma` to 0 for each test case, processes the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and prints the result for each test case separately.
