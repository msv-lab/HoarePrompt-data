### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and then through each number from 1 to `n` in that test case, summing the digits of each number, and accumulating this sum. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given integer `n`.

However, there is a critical issue in the program's structure. The variable `soma` is not being reset between test cases. This means that the sum from previous test cases will carry over into the next test case, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, `soma` should be initialized inside the loop that processes each test case, ensuring that it starts at 0 for each new test case.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program will produce incorrect results due to the accumulation of `soma` across multiple test cases. It should be modified to reset `soma` for each test case. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
N = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    results.append(soma)

for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
```

This version ensures that `soma` is reset to 0 for each test case and the results are stored and printed correctly.
