Output State: **The program returns the sum of the digits of the integer `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.**

This means the program converts the integer `n` to a string, iterates over each character in the string (which represents a digit), converts each character back to an integer, and then sums these integers. The result is the sum of the digits of `n`.
