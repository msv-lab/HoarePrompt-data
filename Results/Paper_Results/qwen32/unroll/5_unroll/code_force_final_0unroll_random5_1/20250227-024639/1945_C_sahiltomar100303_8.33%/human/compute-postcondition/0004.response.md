Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` containing only '0's and '1's. For each test case, it determines the optimal position to place a dividing line such that the number of '0's on the left side and '1's on the right side are maximized, according to the given conditions. The function outputs the position of this dividing line for each test case.**
