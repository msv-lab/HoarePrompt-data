Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses. The next line contains a string a of length n, consisting only of 0s and 1s, where a_j = 0 if the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side of the street, and a_j = 1 if they want to live on the right side. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**

In natural language: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The other conditions and constraints of the input remain unchanged.
