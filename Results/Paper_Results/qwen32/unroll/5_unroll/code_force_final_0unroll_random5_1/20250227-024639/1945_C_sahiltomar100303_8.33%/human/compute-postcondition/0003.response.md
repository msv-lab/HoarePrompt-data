Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s. In the string `a`, a value of 0 indicates that the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side of the street, and a value of 1 indicates a preference for the right side. The function returns the number of residents who want to live on the left side and the number of residents who want to live on the right side for each test case.**
