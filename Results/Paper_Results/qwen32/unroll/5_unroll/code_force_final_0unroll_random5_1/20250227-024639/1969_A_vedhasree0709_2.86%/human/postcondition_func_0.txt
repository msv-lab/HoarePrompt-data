The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it prints either `2` if there exists a pair of consecutive elements in the list that are in reverse order (i.e., `p[i] == i + 2` and `p[i + 1] == i + 1`), or `3` if no such pair exists. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.
