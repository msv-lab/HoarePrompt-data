Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `N` is the integer value read from input, `vals` is a list of integers read from the input, `prod` is the product of all integers in `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`, `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`, and the current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.**
