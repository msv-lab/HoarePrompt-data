You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    -1

Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
cases = int(input())
for n in range(cases):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    prod = 1
    for r in vals:
        prod *= r
    vprod = [prod // r for r in vals]
    den = prod - sum(vprod)
    if den <= 0:
        print(-1)
        return
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `vals` from the input, calculates the product of all integers in `vals`, and then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the product divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. It then calculates a denominator `den` as the product minus the sum of `vprod`. If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string. The function returns `None`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the coins received back for any winning outcome. The coins received back for a winning outcome `i` is the bet on that outcome multiplied by a given multiplier `k_i`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.
   
2. **Calculation of Product:**
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers `prod = k_1 * k_2 * ... * k_n`.
   
3. **Calculation of `vprod`:**
   - For each multiplier `k_i`, the program calculates `vprod[i] = prod / k_i`. This essentially computes the product of all multipliers except `k_i`.
   
4. **Check for Valid Distribution:**
   - The program calculates `den = prod - sum(vprod)`. This is intended to ensure that the total bet (`sum(vprod)`) is strictly less than the coins received back for any winning outcome.
   - If `den <= 0`, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the values in `vprod`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Logic of `vprod`:**
  - The values in `vprod` are calculated as the product of all multipliers except the current one. This ensures that if outcome `i` wins, the coins received back (`k_i * vprod[i]`) will be equal to `prod`.
  - Since `prod` is the product of all `k_i`, and `vprod[i]` is the product of all `k_j` where `j != i`, `k_i * vprod[i]` will indeed be `prod`.
  
- **Check for Valid Distribution:**
  - The program checks if `den = prod - sum(vprod) > 0`. This is intended to ensure that the total bet (`sum(vprod)`) is strictly less than `prod`.
  - However, the logic here is flawed. The condition `den > 0` is not sufficient to guarantee that the bet is strictly less than the coins received back for any winning outcome. The correct condition should be that for every `i`, `k_i * vprod[i] > sum(vprod)`. This condition is not checked by the program.
  
- **Example Case Analysis:**
  - Consider the first test case: `n = 3`, `k_1 = 3`, `k_2 = 2`, `k_3 = 7`.
    - `prod = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
    - `vprod = [42/3, 42/2, 42/7] = [14, 21, 6]`
    - `sum(vprod) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
    - `den = 42 - 41 = 1 > 0`, so the program prints `14 21 6`.
    - However, if the third outcome wins, the coins received back are `7 * 6 = 42`, which is not strictly greater than `41`.
  
- **Conclusion:**
  - The program does not correctly ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the coins received back for any winning outcome. It only checks if the total bet is less than the product of all multipliers, which is not sufficient.
