### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to construct an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, there are a few issues with the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Logic for Constructing the Array**:
   - The program tries to use a method of reducing `X` by half if it's even and subtracting 1 if it's odd, appending either a `max` or `min` value to the list `ans` respectively.
   - This logic does not directly translate into constructing an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The relationship between the operations performed and the number of increasing subsequences is not clearly defined.

2. **Number of Increasing Subsequences**:
   - The number of increasing subsequences in an array is not straightforwardly related to the operations described in the program. For example, if we append `max` values, we do not necessarily create new increasing subsequences in a controlled manner.
   - The program does not ensure that the array constructed will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

3. **Handling Large `X` Values**:
   - The problem specifies that `X` can be as large as `10^18`, which is a very large number. The current approach of repeatedly dividing by 2 or subtracting 1 will take a very large number of steps and may not be efficient or correct for such large values.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format seems to be correct in terms of printing the length of the array and the array itself, but the content of the array does not guarantee the desired number of increasing subsequences.

### Correctness:

Given the reasoning above, the program does not guarantee that the constructed array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect for the given problem.

**Correctness: False**
