The code snippet reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This does not affect the values of `n` or `a` as they are defined in subsequent test cases. The only change is the introduction of the variable `t`.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `n` is either 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'**.
