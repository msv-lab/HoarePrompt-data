To determine the state adjustments needed for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `while t:`. This loop will execute as long as `t` is truthy. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered truthy, and zero is considered falsy.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4

Since `t` is guaranteed to be in the range from 1 to 10,000, it will always be a non-zero integer and thus truthy. Therefore, the loop will execute at least once without any need to adjust the state of `t`.

No other variables (`n`, `x`, etc.) are part of the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state remains the same as provided.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
