The input consists of two integers N and M representing the dimensions of the field, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd. This is followed by N lines of M pairs of characters, each pair representing an entity on the field. Each pair can be ".." for an empty cell, "R0" to "R9" or "B0" to "B9" for players, "RG" or "BG" for goals, or ".Q" for the Quaffle. The next line contains an integer T representing the number of steps (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000). The following T lines each describe an action performed by an entity, which includes a pair of characters representing the entity and a character representing the action (U, D, L, R for movement, C for catching a ball followed by the ball's identifier, and T for throwing the Quaffle).
