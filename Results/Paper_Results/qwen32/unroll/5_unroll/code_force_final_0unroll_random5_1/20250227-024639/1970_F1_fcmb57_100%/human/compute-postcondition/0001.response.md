The code snippet assigns the value of `b` to both `dx` and `dy`. Therefore, the values of `dx` and `dy` will now be equal to the value of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer representing the number of lines in the field (3 ≤ a ≤ 99, and a is odd); `b` is an integer representing the number of columns in the field (3 ≤ b ≤ 99, and b is odd). The field is represented by a list of `a` strings, where each string contains `b` pairs of characters separated by spaces, representing the entities in the field. The next input is an integer T (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000), followed by T lines, each describing an action performed by an entity on the field. `x` is equal to `a`; `y` is equal to `a`; `dx` is equal to `b`; `dy` is equal to `b`.**
