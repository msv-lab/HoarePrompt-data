### Reasoning:

Let's carefully evaluate the provided program and its function `func_1` against the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password string itself.

2. **Function `func_1(n, password)`:**
   - **Initialization:** Two separate lists, `letters` and `digits`, are initialized to store the letters and digits from the password, respectively.
   - **Character Classification:**
     - The program iterates through each character in the password.
     - If the character is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it is appended to the `letters` list.
   - **Sorting Check:**
     - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
     - The program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
   - **Digit After Letter Check:**
     - The program iterates through each character in the password (except the last one).
     - If a letter is followed by a digit, it returns `'NO'`.
   - **Return 'YES':**
     - If none of the above conditions are violated, the password is considered strong, and the program returns `'YES'`.

### Verification Against the Problem Description:

- **Condition 1:** The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The problem description states that the input is valid, so the program does not need to explicitly check this condition. It assumes valid inputs as per the problem statement.
- **Condition 2:** There should be no digit that comes after a letter. This is correctly checked by iterating through the password and ensuring that no letter is followed by a digit.
- **Condition 3:** All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is correctly checked by comparing the `digits` list to its sorted version.
- **Condition 4:** All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is correctly checked by comparing the `letters` list to its sorted version.

### Function Summary Validation:

The function summary accurately describes what the function `func_1` does:
- It checks if the letters in the password are sorted.
- It checks if the digits in the password are sorted.
- It checks if there is no digit immediately following a letter.
- It returns 'NO' if any of these conditions are violated, otherwise 'YES'.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to verify whether a given password meets Monocarp's criteria for being strong. The function summary is accurate, and the program adheres to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
