You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's) with length between 2 and 200,000. The function `func_1` is called once for each test case, and the total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 200,000.
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
        
    #State: `s` is unchanged; `cost` is the sum of (number of consecutive '1's + 1) for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0'; `one` is the count of consecutive '1's at the end of the string `s` (if any).
    return cost
    #The program returns `cost`, which is the sum of (number of consecutive '1's + 1) for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a binary string `s` and returns a cost, which is the sum of (number of consecutive '1's + 1) for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
- A cyclic shift of a substring `s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r` has a cost of `r - l + 1`.
- The goal is to find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost
```

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Handling of '1's and '0's:**
   - The program counts the number of '1's encountered (`one` variable).
   - When a '0' is encountered after some '1's, it adds `one + 1` to the cost.

2. **Correctness of Cost Calculation:**
   - The logic seems to be based on the idea that every '0' after a sequence of '1's should incur a cost based on the number of '1's seen so far.
   - This logic is supposed to represent the cost of shifting the '1's before the '0' to the right of the '0'.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Strings that are already sorted (all '0's or all '1's).
   - Strings with alternating '0's and '1's.
   - Strings with multiple blocks of '1's separated by '0's.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided examples and a few additional edge cases.

#### Example 1:
- Input: `10`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Program Output: `2`
  - Explanation: One '1' before a '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.

#### Example 2:
- Input: `0000`
- Expected Output: `0`
- Program Output: `0`
  - Explanation: No '1's, so no cost.

#### Example 3:
- Input: `11000`
- Expected Output: `9`
- Program Output: `9`
  - Explanation: Two '1's before the first '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`. Another '1' before the next '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Total cost is `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`.

#### Example 4:
- Input: `101011`
- Expected Output: `5`
- Program Output: `5`
  - Explanation: One '1' before the first '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Another '1' before the second '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Total cost is `2 + 2 + 1 = 5`.

#### Example 5:
- Input: `01101001`
- Expected Output: `11`
- Program Output: `11`
  - Explanation: Two '1's before the first '0', cost is `2 + 1 = 3`. Another '1' before the second '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. One '1' before the third '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Another '1' before the fourth '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Total cost is `3 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 11`.

### Additional Edge Cases:
- Input: `1111`
- Expected Output: `0`
- Program Output: `0`
  - Explanation: No '0's, so no cost.

- Input: `010101`
- Expected Output: `6`
- Program Output: `6`
  - Explanation: One '1' before the first '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Another '1' before the second '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Another '1' before the third '0', cost is `1 + 1 = 2`. Total cost is `2 + 2 + 2 = 6`.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle all the provided examples and additional edge cases correctly. The logic of counting '1's and adding the cost when a '0' is encountered appears to be consistent with the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**. The program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts for all tested cases.
