The code snippet provided initializes a variable `cost` to 0. This action does not affect the string `s` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change in the state is the introduction of the variable `cost` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`s` is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's) with length between 2 and 200,000; `cost` is 0.**
