Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Specifically, it does not properly check all possible positions for the road and does not ensure that the road is placed as close to the middle as possible when multiple valid positions exist. 

Here are some issues with the code:
1. The initial split of the list into left and right parts is done at the midpoint, which may not be valid.
2. The loops for adjusting the road position (`leftMove` is unused) do not correctly handle all edge cases.
3. The final comparison to determine the best position does not account for the possibility of multiple valid positions that are equally close to the middle.

The logic needs to be revised to ensure that the road is placed such that the conditions are met and it is as close to the middle as possible. A more thorough and correct approach would involve iterating through all possible positions for the road and checking the conditions for each position.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        best_i = -1
        min_diff = float('inf')
        left_zero = 0
        right_one = s.count('1')
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i > 0:
                if s[i - 1] == '0':
                    left_zero += 1
                else:
                    right_one -= 1
            
            left_size = i
            right_size = n - i
            
            if left_zero >= (left_size + 1) // 2 and right_one >= (right_size + 1) // 2:
                diff = abs(n // 2 - i)
                if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and i < best_i):
                    min_diff = diff
                    best_i = i
        
        print(best_i)

func()
```

This version of the program iterates through all possible positions for the road, checks if the conditions are met, and keeps track of the position that is closest to the middle.
