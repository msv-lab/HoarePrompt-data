Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `l` is 'YES'.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from the initial state. The variable `l` is newly assigned the value 'YES'.
