Reasoning: 
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task requires finding the minimum possible penalty after optimally splitting the array formed by the string into subarrays, where the penalty for each subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The goal is to minimize the total penalty.

However, the given program only counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string and prints their difference, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements. The program does not perform any splitting or penalty calculation as required by the problem description.

The annotations also confirm that the program is simply calculating the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters and printing that value. This is consistent with the original assessment.

Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
