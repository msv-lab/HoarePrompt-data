Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the strategy for the game as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` simply counts the number of pairs of cards in the player's hand and returns that count as the maximum score. However, this does not account for Nene's optimal play, which is to maximize her score and minimize the player's score.

Let's consider an example to show why the program is incorrect:

**Example:**

Input:
```
1
4
1 2 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Explanation:
- The player's cards are 1, 2, 2, 3.
- Nene's cards are 1, 3, 4, 4.
- The game could proceed as follows:
  1. Player plays 1 (no point, table: {1}).
  2. Nene plays 3 (no point, table: {1, 3}).
  3. Player plays 2 (no point, table: {1, 2, 3}).
  4. Nene plays 4 (no point, table: {1, 2, 3, 4}).
  5. Player plays 2 (1 point, table: {1, 2, 2, 3, 4}).
  6. Nene plays 4 (1 point, table: {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4}).
  7. Player plays 3 (no point, table: {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4}).
  8. Nene plays 1 (no point, table: {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4}).

In this case, the player scores 1 point, and Nene scores 2 points. The program, however, would output 2 because there are two pairs in the player's hand (two 2s).

Thus, the program does not correctly simulate the game or account for Nene's optimal strategy. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
