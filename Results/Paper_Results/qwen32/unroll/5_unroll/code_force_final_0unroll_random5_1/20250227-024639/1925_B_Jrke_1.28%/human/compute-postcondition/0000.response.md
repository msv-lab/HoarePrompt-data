The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which represents the loop variable that is not used in the loop body. The loop iterates `int(input())` times. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input to the `input()` function, which determines the number of iterations.

For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be at least 1. The state before the loop starts includes the value of `t`, `x`, and `n`, but only `t` is relevant to the loop's execution since it dictates the number of test cases, and each test case will execute the loop `int(input())` times.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted so that `t` is at least 1, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3**
