Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a sequence of positions and associated values. For each test case, it determines the winner between two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on the maximum possible accumulated score after a specified number of moves. The result for each test case is either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw', indicating the winner or if the game is a tie.**
