### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its logic, using the annotations and the problem description to verify its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case independently.
   - It reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a` as specified.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program correctly checks if the scores at the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are equal to the maximum score in the array `a`.
     - If both have the maximum score, it immediately prints "Draw".
     - If Bodya has the maximum score, it prints "Bodya".
     - If Sasha has the maximum score, it prints "Sasha".
   - This logic is correct and handles the scenarios where one or both players start at the maximum score.

3. **Simulating the Game:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns, updating the scores and positions of both players.
   - It uses two lists `b` and `s` to keep track of the scores for Bodya and Sasha respectively.
   - It uses two flags `foundb` and `founds` to determine if either player has reached the maximum score.
   - If a player reaches the maximum score, they stay at that position and their score is updated accordingly for the remaining turns.
   - The simulation logic is correct and follows the rules of the game.

4. **Calculating Total Scores:**
   - The program calculates the total scores for both players by summing up the scores from each turn.
   - It also calculates the potential maximum scores for both players if they were to stay at their current positions for the remaining turns.
   - This is done by appending the remaining turns multiplied by the maximum score to the respective lists `b` and `s` once a player reaches the maximum score.

5. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The program compares the maximum potential scores of both players.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's potential score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's potential score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.
   - The logic for determining the winner is correct.

### Analysis:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" as per the problem description. It handles all edge cases and simulates the game accurately.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" as per the problem description. It handles all edge cases and simulates the game accurately.

### Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
