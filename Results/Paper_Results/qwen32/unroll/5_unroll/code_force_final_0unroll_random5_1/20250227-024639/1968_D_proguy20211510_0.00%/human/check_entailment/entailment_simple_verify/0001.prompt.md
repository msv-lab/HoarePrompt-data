You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the given rules. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program and its logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It also reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program first checks if the scores at the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are equal to the maximum score in the array `a`.
     - If both have the maximum score, it immediately prints "Draw".
     - If Bodya has the maximum score, it prints "Bodya".
     - If Sasha has the maximum score, it prints "Sasha".

3. **Simulating the Game:**
   - If neither player starts at the maximum score, the program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - It keeps track of the scores for both players (`b` for Bodya and `s` for Sasha) and whether they have reached the maximum score (`foundb` and `founds`).
   - For each turn, it updates the scores and positions of both players unless they have already found the maximum score.

4. **Calculating Total Scores:**
   - The program calculates the total scores for both players by summing up the scores from each turn.
   - It also calculates the potential maximum scores for both players if they were to stay at their current positions for the remaining turns.

5. **Determining the Winner:**
   - Finally, the program compares the maximum potential scores of both players.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's potential score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's potential score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Analysis:

The program's logic is correct in the sense that it follows the rules of the game and determines the winner based on the scores accumulated over `k` turns. However, there are a few points to consider:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where both players start at the maximum score correctly.
  - It also handles the case where one player starts at the maximum score.

- **Simulation:**
  - The simulation for `k` turns is done correctly, considering the movement based on the permutation and the score accumulation based on the array `a`.

- **Potential Scores:**
  - The calculation of potential maximum scores is correct, taking into account the remaining turns after reaching the maximum score.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" as per the problem description. It handles all edge cases and simulates the game accurately.

### Correctness: **True**
