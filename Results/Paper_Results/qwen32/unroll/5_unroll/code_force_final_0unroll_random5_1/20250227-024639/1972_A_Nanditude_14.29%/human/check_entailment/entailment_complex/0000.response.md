Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The program is intended to determine the minimum number of new problems to propose such that the difficulty of each proposed problem (in list `a`) is less than or equal to the expected maximum difficulty (in list `b`). However, the logic in the program is flawed.

Here is a detailed breakdown of what the program does and why it is incorrect:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n`, the list `a`, and the list `b`.

2. **Logic to Determine Minimum New Problems:**
   - The program uses two pointers `i` and `j` to iterate through `a` and `b` respectively.
   - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current problem in `a` is more difficult than expected, so the program tries to replace `a[i]` with `b[j]` and increments the count of new problems (`cnt`). However, this approach is flawed because:
     - It does not insert a new problem with difficulty `b[j]` and then sort the list `a`.
     - Instead of sorting the list `a` after each insertion, it directly replaces `a[i]` with `b[j]`, which does not guarantee that the list `a` remains sorted.
     - The logic of removing the last element and inserting `b[j]` at position `i` is incorrect because it does not simulate the process of adding a new problem and then removing the most difficult one.

3. **Sorting Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined but never used in the program. This function sorts the input list in descending order, which is not relevant to solving the problem.

To fix the program, we need to:
- Insert a new problem with difficulty `b[j]` into the list `a`.
- Sort the list `a` after each insertion.
- Remove the last element from the list `a` (the most difficult problem).
- Repeat the process until all problems in `a` are less than or equal to the corresponding problems in `b`.

Given the incorrect logic, the program does not produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
