Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. The program attempts to insert elements from `b` into `a` and then sort `a`, but this approach is incorrect. The problem specifies that when a new problem with difficulty `w` is proposed, it is inserted into the array `a`, and then `a` is sorted, and the most difficult problem (the last element) is removed. The program does not follow this logic.

2. The program uses a two-pointer approach, but it incorrectly tries to insert elements from `b` into `a` at the current position of `i` and then increments both `i` and `j`. This does not simulate the process of inserting a new problem and removing the most difficult one.

3. The function `func_1(arr)` is defined but never used in the program.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < n and j < n:
        if a[i] > b[j]:
            # Insert a new problem with difficulty b[j]
            a.pop()  # Remove the most difficult problem
            a.append(b[j])  # Add the new problem
            a.sort()  # Sort the array
            cnt += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            j += 1
    print(cnt)
```

In this corrected version, when `a[i]` is greater than `b[j]`, we simulate the insertion of a new problem with difficulty `b[j]`, remove the most difficult problem from `a`, sort `a`, and increment the count `cnt`.
