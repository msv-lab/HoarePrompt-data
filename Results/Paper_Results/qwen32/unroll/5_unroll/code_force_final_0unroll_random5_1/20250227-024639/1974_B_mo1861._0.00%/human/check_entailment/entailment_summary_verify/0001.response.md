### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Recap:
1. **Encoding Process:**
   - A new string `r` is created from the distinct characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in the original string `s` is replaced by its symmetric character from `r`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - Given an encoded string `b`, we need to restore the original string `s`.
   - This involves reversing the encoding process.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Logic (`func_1` function):**
   - **Creating the Character Map:**
     - `char_map` is a dictionary that maps each character in the sorted set of `b` to its symmetric character.
     - The symmetric character is calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, which is incorrect.
     - The correct symmetric character should be the character at the mirrored position in the sorted set of `b`, not a character based on the length of `b`.
   - **Building the Decoded String `s`:**
     - The decoded string `s` is constructed by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding value from `char_map`.

#### Errors in the Program:
- The calculation for the symmetric character in `char_map` is incorrect. Instead of using `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, it should map each character in the sorted set of `b` to its symmetric counterpart in the same set.
- The provided program does not correctly map the characters to their symmetric counterparts in the context of the distinct characters of `b`.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Creating the Character Map:**
   - Sort the distinct characters of `b` to get `r`.
   - Map each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

2. **Building the Decoded String:**
   - Replace each character in `b` with its mapped value from the character map.

### Correct Implementation:
The correct implementation should map each character in the sorted set of `b` to its symmetric counterpart in the same set. Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    sorted_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {sorted_chars[i]: sorted_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(sorted_chars))}
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    return s
```

#### Evaluation:
The original program incorrectly calculates the symmetric character by mapping to characters in the alphabet starting from 'a', which is not aligned with the problem's requirements. The correct approach is to map each character in the sorted set of `b` to its symmetric counterpart within the same set.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the errors in the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
