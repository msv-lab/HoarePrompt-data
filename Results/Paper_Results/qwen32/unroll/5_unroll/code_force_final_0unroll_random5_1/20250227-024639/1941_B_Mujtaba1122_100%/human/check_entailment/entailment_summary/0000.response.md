### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and their behavior to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

**Function `func_1`**:
- **Purpose**: Check if all elements in the list from index 0 to n-1 are zero.
- **Logic**: Iterates through the list and returns `False` if it finds any non-zero element. Otherwise, it returns `True`.
- **Correctness**: This function correctly checks if the entire list is zero, which is a necessary condition for the solution.

**Function `func_2`**:
- **Purpose**: Modify the list based on the given operation and determine if it's possible to make all elements zero.
- **Logic**:
  - Iterates through the list from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive).
  - For each index `i`, it repeatedly applies the operation as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`.
  - The operation updates the list elements as follows:
    - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
    - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
    - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
  - If `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the modifications, it prints 'no' and returns.
  - If all elements are zero after the loop, it checks using `func_1` and prints 'YES' if true, otherwise 'NO'.

**Issues in `func_2`**:
- The operation logic in `func_2` is incorrect. Specifically, the decrement operations:
  - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
  - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
  - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
  - These operations should decrement by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, not by multiples of `list[i - 1]`. The correct operations should be:
    - `list[i + 1] -= 1`
    - `list[i] -= 2`
    - `list[i - 1] -= 1`
- The condition `list[i] > 1` is also problematic. The correct condition should be `list[i] >= 2` because we need at least 2 in `list[i]` to perform the operation.

### Conclusion:
Given the incorrect operation logic in `func_2`, the program does not correctly determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.

**Correctness: False**
