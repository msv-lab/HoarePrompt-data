Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains logical errors in the `func_2` function that prevent it from correctly determining whether the array can be made all zeros using the described operations. Here are the main issues:

1. **Incorrect Decrement Logic**: The program attempts to decrement elements in the array but does so incorrectly. Specifically, the lines:
   ```python
   list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
   list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
   list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
   ```
   imply that the decrement should be based on the value of `list[i - 1]`, but this is not the intended operation. The operation should decrement `a_{i-1}` by 1, `a_i` by 2, and `a_{i+1}` by 1, not by multiples of `list[i - 1]`.

2. **Premature Termination**: The program incorrectly prints 'no' and exits the function if `list[i - 1]` is not zero after processing an index `i`. This is incorrect because the algorithm should continue processing the array even if some elements are not zero after processing a particular index.

3. **Inefficient and Incomplete Check**: The function `func_1` is used to check if all elements are zero, but the main logic in `func_2` does not correctly ensure that all elements can be made zero. The logic should ensure that the array can be processed in such a way that all elements become zero, which is not guaranteed by the current implementation.

Here is a corrected version of the logic to determine if the array can be made all zeros:

```python
def can_make_all_zeros(a, n):
    # The sum of the array should be even because each operation reduces the sum by 4
    if sum(a) % 4 != 0:
        return "NO"
    
    # Try to reduce the array to zeros
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while a[i] >= 2 and a[i - 1] >= 1 and a[i + 1] >= 1:
            a[i - 1] -= 1
            a[i] -= 2
            a[i + 1] -= 1
    
    # Check if all elements are zero
    if all(x == 0 for x in a):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, input[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(can_make_all_zeros(a, n))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version ensures that the sum of the array is checked for evenness (since each operation reduces the sum by 4) and correctly processes the array to see if it can be made all zeros.
