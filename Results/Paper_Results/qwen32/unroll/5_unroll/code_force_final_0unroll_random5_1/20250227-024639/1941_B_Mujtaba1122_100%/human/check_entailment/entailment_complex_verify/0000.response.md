### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation.
- The operation involves choosing an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) and updating the array elements as follows:
  - `a[i - 1] = a[i - 1] - 1`
  - `a[i] = a[i] - 2`
  - `a[i + 1] = a[i + 1] - 1`
- We need to check if this can be done for each test case.

#### Provided Program:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Checks if all elements in the list from index `0` to `n-1` are zero.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Attempts to modify the array using the specified operation and checks if all elements can be made zero.

#### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The operation in the problem statement is to subtract 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]`.
   - The provided code incorrectly modifies the array elements as:
     ```python
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     This does not match the described operation and can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect Check in `func_2`**:
   - The code checks `if list[i - 1] != 0` after the while loop, but this doesn't ensure that the entire array can be made zero. It should ensure that all elements in the array are zero after the operations are applied.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the array cannot be made zero due to the constraints of the operations.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The code prints "YES" or "NO" directly within the function, which is not ideal if the function is intended to return these values for further processing or testing.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program before and after key operations, but they do not reflect the correct logic for modifying the array as per the problem statement.

#### Correctness Assessment:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The annotations confirm that the logic in `func_2` is incorrect and does not match the problem's operation.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Ensure that the sum of the array elements is divisible by 3.
2. Simulate the operations to check if all elements can be made zero.

The original assessment correctly identifies these issues and provides a corrected version of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
