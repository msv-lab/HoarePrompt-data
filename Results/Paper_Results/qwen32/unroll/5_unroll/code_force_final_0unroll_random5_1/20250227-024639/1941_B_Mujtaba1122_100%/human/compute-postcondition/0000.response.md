To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head: `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if the range `(1, n - 1)` is non-empty, which means `n - 1` must be greater than 1, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than 2.

Given the condition `3 <= n <= len(list)`, we already know that `n` is within a valid range that allows the loop to execute. However, we need to ensure that the initial state of `i` is consistent with the loop's starting point.

Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Range Condition**: The loop will iterate over `i` in the range from 1 to `n - 2` (inclusive). For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 1, which means `n > 2`. Since `n` is already constrained to be `3 <= n <= len(list)`, this condition is already satisfied.

2. **Initialization of `i`**: The loop variable `i` is initialized to 1 at the start of the first iteration. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `i` before the loop starts, as the loop itself will handle this initialization.

3. **List Constraint**: The state of the `list` does not need to be adjusted because the loop's execution does not depend on the elements of the list, only on the length of the list and the value of `n`.

Given these considerations, the state before the loop starts should be such that `n` is within the specified range, and `i` does not need to be explicitly set since the loop will initialize it.

Thus, the adjusted state is:

State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= len(list)**
