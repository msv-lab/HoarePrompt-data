Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation. The operation can be applied multiple times, and it involves decrementing three consecutive elements in a specific manner.

### Program Analysis
Let's look at the provided code:

#### Function 1: `func_1`
```python
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True
```
`func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero. If any element is not zero, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

#### Function 2: `func_2`
```python
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```
`func_2` attempts to apply the operation to make all elements zero. It iterates through the array from the second element to the second last element. For each element `i`, it tries to apply the operation as long as the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0` are met. The operation is supposed to decrement `list[i + 1]` by `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]` by `2 * list[i - 1]`, and `list[i - 1]` by `list[i - 1]`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Operation Logic**: The operation logic inside the `while` loop is incorrect. The program is supposed to decrement `list[i + 1]` by `1`, `list[i]` by `2`, and `list[i - 1]` by `1`, not by `list[i - 1]`. This is a critical issue that affects the correctness of the solution.
2. **Early Termination**: The program checks if `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the `while` loop and immediately prints 'no' and returns if it is not zero. This is incorrect because the operation might still be applicable to other elements, and the program should continue checking the rest of the array.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: The problem statement allows for any case in the output ('YES' or 'NO'). The program prints 'no' in lowercase, which is not compliant with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect due to the incorrect operation logic, early termination, and non-compliance with case sensitivity in the output.

Correctness: **False**
