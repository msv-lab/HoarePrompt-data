To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to carefully analyze the behavior of the provided loop and the conditions under which it operates.

Let's break down the loop and its conditions:

1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 2` (inclusive). This means it will check and potentially modify elements from the second to the `n-1`th positions in the list.

2. **While Loop Condition**: Inside the loop, a `while` loop runs as long as:
   - `list[i] > 1`
   - `list[i - 1] > 0`
   - `list[i + 1] > 0`

3. **Operations Inside the While Loop**:
   - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`: Decrease the value at position `i + 1` by the value at position `i - 1`.
   - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`: Decrease the value at position `i` by twice the value at position `i - 1`.
   - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`: Set the value at position `i - 1` to 0 (since it's being decreased by itself).

4. **If Condition After While Loop**:
   - After the `while` loop, if `list[i - 1] != 0`, it prints 'no' and exits the function. This means that if any element at position `i - 1` is not zero after the `while` loop, the function terminates early and does not proceed to further iterations of the main loop.

Given these conditions, the loop is designed to reduce the values in the list in a specific way, and the function terminates if it encounters a non-zero value at position `i - 1` after the `while` loop. 

However, based on the operations inside the `while` loop, the value at position `i - 1` is always set to 0 when the `while` loop runs. This means the `if` condition after the `while` loop will never be true unless there's some initial condition that causes the `while` loop to not run for some `i`.

Since the problem does not specify any initial conditions that would cause the `while` loop to not run, we can assume the `while` loop will run as long as the conditions are met, and the `if` condition will not be triggered.

Thus, the loop will reduce the values in the list according to the specified rules until the conditions for the `while` loop are no longer met.

**Output State**: The output state will be a modified version of the initial list where certain elements have been reduced according to the rules specified in the loop. The exact values depend on the initial values in the list, but the general form will be a list with some elements reduced, particularly around the positions `i - 1`, `i`, and `i + 1` for each iteration of the loop.

Given the constraints and the nature of the operations, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **the list with elements at positions `i - 1`, `i`, and `i + 1` reduced according to the loop operations, with no early termination due to the `if` condition.**
