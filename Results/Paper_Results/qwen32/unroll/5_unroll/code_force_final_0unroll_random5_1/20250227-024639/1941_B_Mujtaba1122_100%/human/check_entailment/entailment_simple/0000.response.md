### Reasoning:

The program is supposed to determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation. The operation allows us to choose an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq n-1 \)) and modify the elements at indices \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) as follows:
- \( a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1 \)
- \( a_i = a_i - 2 \)
- \( a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1 \)

The program uses two functions:
- `func_1(list, n)`: Checks if all elements in the list up to index \( n-1 \) are zero.
- `func_2(list, n)`: Iteratively applies the operation to reduce the elements of the list and then checks if all elements are zero using `func_1`.

However, there are several issues with the implementation of `func_2`:

1. **Incorrect Operation Application**:
   - The operation is applied incorrectly. The lines:
     ```python
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     should be:
     ```python
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     ```
     The current implementation subtracts the entire value of `list[i - 1]` from `list[i + 1]` and `list[i - 1]`, and `2 * list[i - 1]` from `list[i]`, which is not what the problem specifies.

2. **Early Termination Condition**:
   - The program incorrectly terminates and prints 'no' if `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the loop. This is not a valid condition for termination because the operation can still be applied to other elements, and `list[i - 1]` can be zeroed out in subsequent operations.

3. **Final Check**:
   - The final check using `func_1` is correct, but it is only reached if the loop does not terminate early, which is not guaranteed to be the correct behavior given the incorrect operation application.

### Correctness:
Given the issues described, the program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
