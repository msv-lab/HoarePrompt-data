Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to determine if Rudolf can make all elements of the array equal to zero using the specified operation. Let's analyze the provided functions and their logic to see if they correctly solve the problem.

### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: Check if all elements in the list from index 0 to n-1 are zero.
- **Implementation**: Iterates through the list up to index `n-1` and returns `False` if any element is not zero. If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
- **Correctness**: This function correctly checks if the first `n` elements of the list are zero.

### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: Determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the given operation.
- **Implementation**:
  - Iterates through the list from index 1 to `n-2` (inclusive).
  - For each index `i`, it repeatedly applies the operation as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0`.
  - The operation subtracts `list[i - 1]` from `list[i + 1]`, `2 * list[i - 1]` from `list[i]`, and `list[i - 1]` from `list[i - 1]`.
  - After the loop, if any element at position `i - 1` is not zero, it immediately prints 'no' and exits.
  - Finally, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements in the list are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
- **Correctness**:
  - The operation logic is flawed. The operation should subtract 1 from `list[i - 1]`, 2 from `list[i]`, and 1 from `list[i + 1]`, not `list[i - 1]` times these values.
  - The condition `list[i] > 1` is too restrictive. The operation can be applied as long as `list[i] >= 2`.
  - The immediate exit upon finding a non-zero `list[i - 1]` is incorrect. The operation might still be applicable to other indices.
  - The logic does not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero; it only checks if the first `n` elements are zero after partial operations.

### Conclusion:
The logic in `func_2` is incorrect due to the flawed operation implementation and the incorrect handling of conditions. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
