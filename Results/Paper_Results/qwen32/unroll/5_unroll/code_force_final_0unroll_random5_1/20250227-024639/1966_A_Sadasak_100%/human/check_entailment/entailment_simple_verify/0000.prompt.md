You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)

    return frequency_table

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the numbers written on the cards, and k is an integer representing the number of cards you exchange during each operation, where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 2 <= k <= 100.

    return frequency_table
    #The program returns `frequency_table`, which is a dictionary where each key is a unique number from the list `arr` and its value is the minimum of the number of times that number appears in `arr` and `k`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the described operations. There are several issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Frequencies**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the frequency of each card number, but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This is not what the problem requires. The frequency should not be capped; it should be the actual count of each card number.
   
2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Minimum Cards**:
   - The code checks if `k` is in the frequency table values and then prints `k - 1` if it is. This is not a correct way to determine the minimum number of cards left. The correct approach involves using the frequencies to determine how many cards can be reduced based on the operations allowed.

3. **No Proper Reduction Logic**:
   - The code does not properly perform the reduction of cards based on the operations described. For example, if there are `x` cards with the same number, and `x >= k`, you can reduce `x` to `x - k + 1` by performing the operation. This logic is not implemented.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def min_cards_left(n, k, nums):
    # Calculate the frequency of each card number
    from collections import Counter
    freq = Counter(nums)
    
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        # For each card number, reduce the count based on the operations
        min_cards += count % (k - 1) if count % (k - 1) != 0 else k - 1
    
    # Ensure that the minimum number of cards is at least 1
    return max(min_cards, 1)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(min_cards_left(n, k, nums))
```

This corrected version calculates the frequency of each card number and then determines the minimum number of cards left by reducing the counts based on the allowed operations. It ensures that the minimum number of cards is at least 1, as no operations can reduce the count to 0.
