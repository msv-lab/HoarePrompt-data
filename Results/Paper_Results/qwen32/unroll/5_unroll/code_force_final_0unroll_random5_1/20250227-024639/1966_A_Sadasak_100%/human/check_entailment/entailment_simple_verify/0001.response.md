### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cards) and `k` (number of cards to exchange).
   - It then reads the list of card numbers.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, so the program correctly prints `n`.

3. **Core Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to create a frequency table of the card numbers but limits the frequency of each card to `k`. This is not the correct approach for minimizing the number of cards.
   - The main logic after calling `func_1` checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k-1` if true. This logic is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal way to minimize the number of cards.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to use the frequencies of each card number and apply the operation to reduce the count of cards optimally.
   - The correct approach would be to use the formula `(count_of_card % (k-1))` for each card and sum these results, adding 1 if the sum is 0 (to handle the case where all cards can be completely removed).

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:

- **State before function call**:
  - `arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers written on the cards.
  - `k` is an integer representing the number of cards you exchange during each operation.
  
- **Inside `func_1`**:
  - `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is a unique number from `arr` and its value is the minimum of the number of times that number appears in `arr` and `k`.
  
- **After `func_1`**:
  - The frequency table is returned, and the program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table.
  - If `k` is found, it prints `k-1`, which is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal reduction.
  - If `k` is not found, it prints `n`, which is also incorrect in many cases.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. The core logic is flawed, and the function `func_1` does not serve the purpose intended. The original assessment is accurate in identifying these issues.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
