You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    #State: `encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin letters present in the strings of `encoded`; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to the corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` in reverse order; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`.`
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns a string `decoded` which is formed by mapping each character in each string of `encoded` using `char_map`. Each character in the original strings of `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` in reverse order as defined in `char_map`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of strings `encoded`, where each string consists of lowercase Latin letters, and returns a single string `decoded`. Each character in the original strings is replaced by its corresponding character from the reversed list of unique characters found in `encoded`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem of decoding the encoded string back to the original string.

The problem requires reversing the encoding process:
1. **Construct the string `r`**: This string consists of all distinct characters from the encoded string `b`, sorted in alphabetical order.
2. **Create a mapping**: Each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r` (i.e., the first character is mapped to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
3. **Decode the string `b`**: Using the mapping created in step 2, replace each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping to get the original string `s`.

The given program follows these steps correctly:
1. **Construct the string `r`**: `unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))` creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string.
2. **Create a mapping**: The loop `for i in range(len_unique): char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]` creates a dictionary that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart.
3. **Decode the string `b`**: `''.join((char_map[ch] for ch in encoded))` constructs the original string by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped character.

Let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided examples:

1. For the input `serofedsoc`, the unique characters are `cdefors`, and the mapping is `{'c': 's', 'd': 'r', 'e': 'o', 'f': 'f', 'o': 'e', 'r': 'd', 's': 'c'}`. Applying this mapping to `serofedsoc` gives `codeforces`.
2. For the input `ttf`, the unique characters are `ft`, and the mapping is `{'f': 't', 't': 'f'}`. Applying this mapping to `ttf` gives `fft`.
3. For the input `tlrhgmaoi`, the unique characters are `aghimortl`, and the mapping is `{'a': 'l', 'g': 'r', 'h': 'o', 'i': 'm', 'l': 'a', 'm': 'i', 'o': 'h', 'r': 'g', 't': 't'}`. Applying this mapping to `tlrhgmaoi` gives `algorithm`.
4. For the input `w`, the unique characters are `w`, and the mapping is `{'w': 'w'}`. Applying this mapping to `w` gives `w`.
5. For the input `hnndledmnhlttin`, the unique characters are `dehilmnnt`, and the mapping is `{'d': 't', 'e': 'n', 'h': 'l', 'i': 'm', 'l': 'h', 'm': 'i', 'n': 'e', 't': 'd'}`. Applying this mapping to `hnndledmnhlttin` gives `meetinthemiddle`.

Since the program correctly decodes all the provided examples, we can conclude that the program is correct.
