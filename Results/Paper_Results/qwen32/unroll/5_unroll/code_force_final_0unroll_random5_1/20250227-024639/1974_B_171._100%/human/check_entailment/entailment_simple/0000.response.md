### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to decode a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves creating an auxiliary string `r` consisting of distinct characters from the original string `s` in alphabetical order. Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric character from `r`.

The task is to reverse this process. The program does this by:
1. Extracting the unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorting them to form `r`.
2. Creating a mapping `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character (i.e., the character at the mirrored position in `r`).
3. Using this mapping to decode the string `b` by replacing each character with its mapped value.

Let's break down the provided code:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    b = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(b))
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
```

- **Input Handling**: The program reads the input and processes each test case by extracting the length of the encoded string and the string itself.
- **Unique Characters and Mapping**: For each encoded string, it calculates the unique characters, sorts them, and creates a mapping from each character to its symmetric counterpart.
- **Decoding**: It then decodes the string by replacing each character according to the mapping.

The program correctly implements the decoding process as described. It ensures that each character in the encoded string is correctly mapped to its original character in the input string `s`.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly performs the decoding task as per the problem statement and the provided examples.

**Correctness: True**
