Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `encoded`, which is a list of strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a string `decoded` formed by mapping each character in each string of `encoded` to its corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` in reverse order as defined in `char_map`.**
