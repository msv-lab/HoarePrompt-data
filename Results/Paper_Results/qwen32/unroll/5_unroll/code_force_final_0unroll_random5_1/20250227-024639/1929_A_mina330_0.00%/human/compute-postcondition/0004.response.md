Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, after sorting the list. It then prints this sum for each test case.**
