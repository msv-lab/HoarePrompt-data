Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The approach taken in the program is incorrect for achieving the maximum beauty. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order. The program sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing up the differences between the largest and smallest elements, which is not the correct approach.

The correct approach is to sort the array in either increasing or decreasing order and then calculate the beauty as the sum of consecutive differences. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()  # or a.sort(reverse=True) both will give the same result for beauty calculation
        kq = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            kq += a[i] - a[i - 1]
        print(kq)

func()
```

This version of the program sorts the array and then calculates the beauty correctly by summing up the differences between consecutive elements.
