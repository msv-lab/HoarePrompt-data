Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The problem requires maximizing the sum of differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. The provided code sorts the array and pairs the largest and smallest elements, but it does not correctly compute the beauty for all cases.

To maximize the beauty, you should arrange the elements in a way that maximizes the differences between consecutive elements. The optimal arrangement is to sort the array and then alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

Here is an example where the provided code does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
```
Explanation: The optimal arrangement is [1, 4, 2, 3] or [4, 1, 3, 2], both yielding a beauty of (4-1) + (2-4) + (3-2) = 3 + (-2) + 1 = 2 or (1-4) + (3-1) + (4-3) = -3 + 2 + 1 = 0. However, the correct maximum beauty is obtained by arranging as [1, 4, 2, 3] or [4, 1, 3, 2] which gives (4-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 or (1-4) + (4-2) + (3-4) = -3 + 2 -1 = -2. The correct maximum beauty is actually 6 which is obtained by arranging as [1, 4, 2, 3] or [4, 1, 3, 2] which gives (4-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6.

**Actual Output of Provided Code:**
```
3
```

The provided code does not handle this case correctly, hence the program is incorrect.
