### Reasoning:
The program aims to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).

To maximize this beauty, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. The optimal way to achieve this is by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the beauty as the sum of the differences between adjacent elements.

However, the provided program does not directly compute the beauty in this manner. Instead, it calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. This approach does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty because it does not consider the order of elements in a way that maximizes the sum of consecutive differences.

For example, consider the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`. The program will sort it to `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` and then compute the sum as follows:
- \(100 - 43 = 57\)
- \(90 - 54 = 36\)
- \(80 - 80 = 0\) (since there's no middle element to pair in this case)

The sum would be \(57 + 36 + 0 = 93\), which is incorrect. The correct maximum beauty is obtained by arranging the array to maximize the sum of consecutive differences, such as `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` which results in:
- \(54 - 43 = 11\)
- \(80 - 54 = 26\)
- \(90 - 80 = 10\)
- \(100 - 90 = 10\)

The sum is \(11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\), which is correct but not the optimal arrangement. The optimal arrangement is `[43, 80, 90, 100, 54]` or similar, which yields a beauty of \(37 + 10 + 10 + (-46) + 49 = 57\).

Therefore, the provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array.

### Correctness: **False**
