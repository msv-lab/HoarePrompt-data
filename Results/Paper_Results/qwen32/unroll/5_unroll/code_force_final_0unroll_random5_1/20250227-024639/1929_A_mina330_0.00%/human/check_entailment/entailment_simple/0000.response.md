Reasoning:

The program is designed to compute the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n.

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements. It then sorts the array. To maximize the beauty, the program pairs the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. The beauty is calculated as the sum of the differences between these pairs.

Let's verify the correctness of the program by analyzing the given examples:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: 3, [2, 1, 3]
   - Sorted array: [1, 2, 3]
   - Pairing: (3 - 1) + (2 - 2) = 2
   - Output: 2

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: 3, [69, 69, 69]
   - Sorted array: [69, 69, 69]
   - Pairing: (69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0
   - Output: 0

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: 5, [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]
   - Sorted array: [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]
   - Pairing: (100 - 43) + (90 - 54) = 57
   - Output: 57

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: 4, [3, 4, 3, 3]
   - Sorted array: [3, 3, 3, 4]
   - Pairing: (4 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1
   - Output: 1

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: 2, [2, 1]
   - Sorted array: [1, 2]
   - Pairing: (2 - 1) = 1
   - Output: 1

The program correctly computes the maximum beauty for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
