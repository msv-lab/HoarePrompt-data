You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        kq = 0
        
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        
        print(kq)
        
    #State: A series of integers, each representing the sum of differences between paired elements of the sorted list for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The problem requires maximizing the sum of differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. The provided code sorts the array and pairs the largest and smallest elements, but it does not correctly compute the beauty for all cases.

To maximize the beauty, you should arrange the elements in a way that maximizes the differences between consecutive elements. The optimal arrangement is to sort the array and then alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

Here is an example where the provided code does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
```
Explanation: The optimal arrangement is [1, 4, 2, 3] or [4, 1, 3, 2], both yielding a beauty of (4-1) + (2-4) + (3-2) = 3 + (-2) + 1 = 2 or (1-4) + (3-1) + (4-3) = -3 + 2 + 1 = 0. However, the correct maximum beauty is obtained by arranging as [1, 4, 2, 3] or [4, 1, 3, 2] which gives (4-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 or (1-4) + (4-2) + (3-4) = -3 + 2 -1 = -2. The correct maximum beauty is actually 6 which is obtained by arranging as [1, 4, 2, 3] or [4, 1, 3, 2] which gives (4-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6.

**Actual Output of Provided Code:**
```
3
```

The provided code does not handle this case correctly, hence the program is incorrect.
