### Reasoning:
The problem requires maximizing the beauty of an array defined as the sum of differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The provided code sorts the array and then sums up the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.

Let's break down the code:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because we want to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.
2. **Calculating the Beauty**: The code calculates the beauty by summing up the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. This is done by iterating through the first half of the sorted array and adding the difference between the corresponding elements from the end and the start of the array.

For example, if the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the beauty is calculated as `(5 - 1) + (4 - 2) = 4 + 2 = 6`. However, the given code calculates the beauty as `(5 - 1) + (4 - 2) = 4 + 2 = 6` only for the first half of the array. For an even number of elements, this is correct. For an odd number of elements, the middle element is not paired and hence does not contribute to the beauty.

The code correctly implements this logic, and the provided example outputs match the expected results based on this logic.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.
