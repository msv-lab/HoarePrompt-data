### Reasoning:

To solve the problem of maximizing the beauty of the array, we need to understand how the beauty is calculated: it is the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\). This can be simplified to \(a_n - a_1 + a_{n-1} - a_2 + \ldots\), which means the beauty is maximized when the largest elements are placed in the odd positions and the smallest elements in the even positions.

The given program sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing up the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest, and so on. This approach works because it ensures that the largest possible differences are used to contribute to the beauty of the array.

Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array is sorted in ascending order.

3. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `kq` (which represents the beauty) to 0.
   - It then iterates over the first half of the sorted array, adding the difference between the corresponding largest and smallest elements to `kq`.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the calculated beauty.

The logic behind the program is correct because it pairs the largest available element with the smallest available element, which maximizes the sum of differences.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array as described in the problem statement.
