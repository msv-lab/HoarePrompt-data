The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `ntest`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`ntest` is an integer such that 1 <= `ntest` <= 500; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
