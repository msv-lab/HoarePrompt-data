Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program simply checks if `n >= m` and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise "No". This logic is flawed because it does not consider whether the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which is a crucial requirement for determining if it's possible to reach exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because:
- If the difference is even, it means that the total number of moves `n` can be split into an even number of additions and removals (or just additions if `n >= m` or just removals if `n < m`), which allows Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes.
- If the difference is odd, it is impossible to reach exactly `m` cubes in `n` moves because every addition or removal is a single move, and an odd difference cannot be balanced with an even number of moves.

For example:
- If `n = 5` and `m = 3`, the difference is `5 - 3 = 2`, which is even. Nikita can remove 2 cubes (2 moves) and then add 3 cubes (3 moves), totaling 5 moves.
- If `n = 3` and `m = 4`, the difference is `4 - 3 = 1`, which is odd. It's not possible to reach exactly 4 cubes in 3 moves.

The provided program does not account for this requirement and will incorrectly output "Yes" for cases where `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, but the difference is odd.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
