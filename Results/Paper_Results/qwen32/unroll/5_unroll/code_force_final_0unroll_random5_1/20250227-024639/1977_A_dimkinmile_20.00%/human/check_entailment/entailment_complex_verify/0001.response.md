Reasoning: 
The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the provided program. The logic in the program is indeed incorrect because it does not account for the requirement that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` must be even for it to be possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - To achieve this, the number of moves `n` must be sufficient to cover the necessary additions and removals to reach `m` cubes.
   - The key insight is that the total number of moves `n` must be able to cover both additions and removals, meaning the difference between `n` and `m` must be even. This is because each addition or removal counts as one move, and to balance out additions and removals, the difference must be even.

2. **Program Logic:**
   - The provided program checks if `n >= m` and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise "No".
   - This logic is flawed because it does not consider the parity (evenness or oddness) of the difference between `n` and `m`.
   - For example, if `n = 3` and `m = 1`, the program would print "Yes" because `3 >= 1`. However, it is not possible to have exactly 1 cube after 3 moves if we start with 0 cubes (we could end up with 0, 1, 2, or 3 cubes, but not exactly 1 cube with all moves used).

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - The correct logic should check if the absolute difference `abs(n - m)` is even.
   - If `abs(n - m)` is even, then it is possible to reach exactly `m` cubes in `n` moves.
   - If `abs(n - m)` is odd, then it is not possible.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the provided program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
