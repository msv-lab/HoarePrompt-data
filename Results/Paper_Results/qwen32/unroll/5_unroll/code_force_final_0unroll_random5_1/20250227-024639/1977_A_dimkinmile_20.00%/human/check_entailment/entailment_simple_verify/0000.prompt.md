You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n >= m) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, then `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. Otherwise, `n` is less than `m`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases correctly. Specifically, the logic `if n >= m: print('Yes')` is flawed. This logic assumes that if the number of moves `n` is greater than or equal to the desired number of cubes `m`, it is always possible to build a tower with `m` cubes. However, this is not true in all cases.

Consider the following counterexample:
- **Input:** `n = 2`, `m = 1`
- **Expected Output:** `Yes` (Nikita can add one cube in the first move and remove one cube in the second move, or add two cubes in the first two moves, or add one cube in the first move and keep it in the second move)
- **Actual Output:** `Yes` (This is correct, but let's consider another case)

Another counterexample:
- **Input:** `n = 1`, `m = 2`
- **Expected Output:** `No` (Nikita can only add one cube in one move, so it's impossible to have 2 cubes)
- **Actual Output:** `No` (This is correct, but let's consider yet another case)

However, the main issue arises when `n` is odd:
- **Input:** `n = 3`, `m = 0`
- **Expected Output:** `Yes` (Nikita can add one cube in the first move, remove it in the second move, and do nothing in the third move)
- **Actual Output:** `No` (This is incorrect because `n` (3) is greater than `m` (0), but the program incorrectly outputs "No")

The correct logic should consider whether `n - m` is non-negative and even, because each "add-then-remove" pair uses up two moves, and if `m` is achievable, the remaining moves after reaching `m` cubes must be even (since they can only be used in pairs of "add-then-remove" or "remove-then-add").

Here is the corrected logic:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This logic ensures that the number of moves `n` is sufficient and that the remaining moves after reaching `m` cubes can be used in pairs.
