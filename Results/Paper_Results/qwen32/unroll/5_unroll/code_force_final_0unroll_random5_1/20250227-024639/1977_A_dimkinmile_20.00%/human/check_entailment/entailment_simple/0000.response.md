Reasoning:  
The program is incorrect based on the problem description. The key aspect of the problem is whether, after `n` moves, Nikita can end up with exactly `m` cubes. The moves can either add or remove one cube at a time. Therefore, the number of cubes `m` can be achieved if and only if `m` is reachable through a sequence of `n` additions and subtractions starting from 0.

The given program only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. This condition is not sufficient to determine if `m` cubes can be achieved after `n` moves. For example, if `n = 2` and `m = 4`, it is impossible to have 4 cubes after 2 moves because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is 2. Similarly, if `n = 5` and `m = 3`, it is possible to achieve 3 cubes after 5 moves (e.g., add 3 cubes and then remove 2 cubes).

The correct condition should be that `m` must be within the range `[0, n]` and `m` must have the same parity (odd or even) as `n` because each move changes the parity of the number of cubes.

Correctness: **False**
