Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases correctly. Specifically, the logic `if n >= m: print('Yes')` is flawed. This logic assumes that if the number of moves `n` is greater than or equal to the desired number of cubes `m`, it is always possible to build a tower with `m` cubes. However, this is not true in all cases.

Consider the following counterexample:
- **Input:** `n = 2`, `m = 1`
- **Expected Output:** `Yes` (Nikita can add one cube in the first move and remove one cube in the second move, or add two cubes in the first two moves, or add one cube in the first move and keep it in the second move)
- **Actual Output:** `Yes` (This is correct, but let's consider another case)

Another counterexample:
- **Input:** `n = 1`, `m = 2`
- **Expected Output:** `No` (Nikita can only add one cube in one move, so it's impossible to have 2 cubes)
- **Actual Output:** `No` (This is correct, but let's consider yet another case)

However, the main issue arises when `n` is odd:
- **Input:** `n = 3`, `m = 0`
- **Expected Output:** `Yes` (Nikita can add one cube in the first move, remove it in the second move, and do nothing in the third move)
- **Actual Output:** `No` (This is incorrect because `n` (3) is greater than `m` (0), but the program incorrectly outputs "No")

The correct logic should consider whether `n - m` is non-negative and even, because each "add-then-remove" pair uses up two moves, and if `m` is achievable, the remaining moves after reaching `m` cubes must be even (since they can only be used in pairs of "add-then-remove" or "remove-then-add").

Here is the corrected logic:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This logic ensures that the number of moves `n` is sufficient and that the remaining moves after reaching `m` cubes can be used in pairs.
