### Reasoning:

The given program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program and how it ensures correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program starts by reading the input string `s` and defining the function `func_1` to perform the balanced shuffle.
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result, and a dictionary `d` to store the cumulative balance of parentheses at each position.

2. **Calculating Cumulative Balance**:
   - The program iterates through the input string `s` and calculates the cumulative balance for each position:
     - If the current character is '(', it increments the balance by 1.
     - If the current character is ')', it decrements the balance by 1.
   - The cumulative balance at each position is stored in the dictionary `d` with the position as the key.

3. **Sorting Based on Balance**:
   - The program removes the last entry from the dictionary `d` (which corresponds to the overall balance of the string, which is 0 for a balanced sequence).
   - It then sorts the dictionary items based on the balance (in increasing order) and the position (in decreasing order for ties). This sorting ensures that characters with lower balance values come first, and for ties, characters that appear later in the original string come first.

4. **Constructing the Result**:
   - After sorting, the program constructs the result string `ans` by concatenating the characters from the original string `s` in the order specified by the sorted dictionary items.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, the program returns the constructed string `ans`.

### Verification with Example:

For the input `(()(()))`:
- The cumulative balance dictionary `d` after processing the string would be: `{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 1, 8: 0}`.
- After removing the last entry and sorting, the order of characters would be: `[(1, 1), (7, 1), (3, 1), (2, 2), (6, 2), (4, 2), (5, 3)]`.
- The resulting string `ans` would be `()(()())`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation and produces the correct output for the given example and any other valid balanced parentheses sequence.

**Correctness: True**
