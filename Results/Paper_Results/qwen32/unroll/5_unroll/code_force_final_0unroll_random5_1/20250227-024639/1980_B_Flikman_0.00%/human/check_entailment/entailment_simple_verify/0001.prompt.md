You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads:
     - `n`: The number of cubes.
     - `f`: The index of Dmitry's favorite cube (1-based).
     - `k`: The number of cubes to be removed.
     - `a`: A list of `n` integers representing the values on the cubes.

2. **Determine the Favorite Cube's Value:**
   - The program identifies the value of the favorite cube using `favorite_value = a[f - 1]`.

3. **Count Cubes with Values Greater and Equal to the Favorite Cube:**
   - It counts how many cubes have values greater than the favorite cube (`greater_count`).
   - It counts how many cubes have the same value as the favorite cube (`same_value_count`).

4. **Determine the Outcome:**
   - If the number of cubes with values greater than the favorite cube (`greater_count`) is at least `k`, the favorite cube will definitely be removed (`YES`).
   - If the sum of cubes with values greater than and equal to the favorite cube (`greater_count + same_value_count`) is less than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will definitely not be removed (`NO`).
   - Otherwise, the favorite cube might be removed or might not be removed (`MAYBE`).

### Correctness Verification:
- **Case 1: `greater_count >= k`**
  - If there are at least `k` cubes with values greater than the favorite cube, then even if all cubes with values equal to the favorite cube are placed after the `k` largest cubes, the favorite cube will still be removed. This is because the first `k` cubes will definitely include all cubes with values greater than the favorite cube, and thus, the favorite cube will be among the removed ones.
- **Case 2: `greater_count + same_value_count <= k`**
  - If the total number of cubes with values greater than or equal to the favorite cube is less than or equal to `k`, then even if all cubes with values greater than the favorite cube are placed before it, the favorite cube will still be among the first `k` cubes and thus will be removed. Since there are not enough cubes with values greater than the favorite cube to fill the first `k` positions, the favorite cube will be removed.
- **Case 3: Otherwise**
  - If the number of cubes with values greater than the favorite cube is less than `k`, and the total number of cubes with values greater than or equal to the favorite cube is more than `k`, then the fate of the favorite cube depends on the exact order of the cubes. It may be removed or it may not be removed, hence the answer is `MAYBE`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all three cases and produces the correct output based on the conditions described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
