Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of equal length. For each test case, it checks if string `c` can be formed by characters from the corresponding positions in strings `a` and `b`. It outputs "YES" if `c` can be formed in this manner, otherwise "NO". The final state of the program includes the processed values of `a`, `b`, and `c` from the last test case.**
