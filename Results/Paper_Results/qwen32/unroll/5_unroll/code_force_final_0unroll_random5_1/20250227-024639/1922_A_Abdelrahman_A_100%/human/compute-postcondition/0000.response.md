The code snippet `tests = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `tests`. This input represents the number of test cases, `t`, which was previously described as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; tests is the integer value of t; n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; a, b, and c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**
