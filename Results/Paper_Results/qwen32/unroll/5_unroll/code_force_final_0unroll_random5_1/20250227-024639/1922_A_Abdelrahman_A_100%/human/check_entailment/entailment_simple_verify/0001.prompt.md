You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')

    #State: - After all iterations, the only variables that are affected and need to be described in the output state are `tests`, `a`, `b`, and `c` (as these are the only variables that are modified inside the loop).
    #   - The variable `no` is a local variable within each iteration and does not affect the output state across iterations.
    #   - The variable `slength` is read but not stored or used after the current iteration, so it does not affect the output state.
    #
    #Given that the loop modifies `a`, `b`, and `c` in each iteration, the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the values from the last test case processed. The variable `tests` remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases and is not modified within the loop.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that:
- Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

### Template Matching Rules
- If the i-th letter of the template `t` is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string `s` must be the same as `t_i`.
- If the i-th letter of the template `t` is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string `s` must be different from the lowercase version of `t_i`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem with the following logic:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - It checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`. If true, it prints "NO" because if `c` is exactly the same as `a` or `b`, it is impossible for `c` to not match a template that `a` and `b` match.

3. **Template Matching Logic:**
   - If `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`, it iterates through each character of `c` and checks if the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are not the same as the character in `c`. If it finds such a character, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a character, it prints "NO".

### Flaws in the Program Logic
The main flaw in the program logic is in the template matching logic. The program only checks if the characters in `a` and `b` are different from the corresponding characters in `c`. This does not correctly implement the template matching rules:

- The program should check if there exists a template `t` such that:
  - For each position `i`, if `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[i]` should be different from `a[i]`.
  - If `a[i] != b[i]`, then the template `t[i]` can be either uppercase (different from `a[i]` and `b[i]`) or lowercase (same as `a[i]` or `b[i]`).

### Correctness
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the template matching rules, and thus it can produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
