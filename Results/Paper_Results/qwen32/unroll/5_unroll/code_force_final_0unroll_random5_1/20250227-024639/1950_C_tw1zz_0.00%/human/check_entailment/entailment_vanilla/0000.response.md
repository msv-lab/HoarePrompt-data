Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format by using a series of if-elif statements to map each hour from 00 to 23 to its corresponding hour in 12-hour format. However, there is a mistake in the mapping for the hour '00'. According to the problem description, '00' in 24-hour format should correspond to '12 AM' in 12-hour format, not '12 PM'. The program incorrectly maps '00' to '12 PM'.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:
- The program correctly maps hours from '01' to '11' to '01 AM' to '11 AM'.
- The program correctly maps hours from '13' to '23' to '01 PM' to '11 PM'.
- The program incorrectly maps '00' to '12 PM', when it should be '12 AM'.

To fix the program, the line:
```python
elif h == '00':
    h1 = '12'
    time = 'PM'
```
should be changed to:
```python
elif h == '00':
    h1 = '12'
    time = 'AM'
```

Correctness: **False**
