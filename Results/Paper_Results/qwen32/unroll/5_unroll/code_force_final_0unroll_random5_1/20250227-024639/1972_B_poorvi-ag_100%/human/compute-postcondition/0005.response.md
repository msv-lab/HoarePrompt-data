Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

Given the loop provided, the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list and prints it. Since the loop does not modify the `results` list or any other variables outside of its body, the state of `results` remains unchanged after the loop completes. The loop simply outputs each element of `results` to the console.

Therefore, the output state of `results` is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`results` is a list of length `t` containing 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in each string `s` is odd or even respectively.**
