Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins ('U'). The key insight is that if the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice will always win, and if it is even, Bob will always win. This is because each move reduces the number of 'U' coins by one, and the player who makes the last move (leaving no 'U' coins for the opponent) wins. The program efficiently checks this condition for each test case and outputs the correct result.
