### Reasoning:

The key insight to solving this problem is to determine the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the initial configuration. The game's outcome depends on this parity because:

- If the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he faces an even number of 'U' coins. This is because flipping two adjacent coins (which happens when a 'U' coin is removed) does not change the parity of the number of 'U' coins.
- Conversely, if the number of 'U' coins is even, Bob can always force Alice into a position where she faces an odd number of 'U' coins, following the same logic.

Since the game will end when there are no more 'U' coins left, the player who starts with an odd number of 'U' coins can always ensure that they are the one to make the last move and thus win the game. Hence, Alice wins if the initial number of 'U' coins is odd, and Bob wins if it is even.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the count of 'U' in the input string `s` for each test case and appending 'yes' to the results if the count is odd, and 'no' if it is even. This matches the expected behavior based on the problem description.
