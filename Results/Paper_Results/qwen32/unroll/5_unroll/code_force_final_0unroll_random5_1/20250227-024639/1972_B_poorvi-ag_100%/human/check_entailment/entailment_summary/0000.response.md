Reasoning:  
The problem hinges on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the initial configuration. The key insight is that Alice wins if and only if the number of 'U' coins is odd. This is because each player can only remove a 'U' coin, and flipping adjacent coins does not change the parity of the total number of 'U' coins. If there is an odd number of 'U' coins, Alice can always ensure that she is the one to remove the last 'U' coin, thus winning the game. Conversely, if the number of 'U' coins is even, Bob will be the one to remove the last 'U' coin, leading to his victory.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of 'U' coins in the string for each test case and checking if this count is odd. If it is, the program outputs 'yes' indicating that Alice will win; otherwise, it outputs 'no' indicating that Bob will win.

Execution Summary confirms that the program reads the input correctly, processes each test case by counting 'U' coins, and outputs the correct result based on the parity of the count.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
