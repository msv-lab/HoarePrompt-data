The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only 'U' and 'D'. It then determines if the count of 'U' in the string `s` is odd, appending 'yes' to the results if it is, and 'no' if it is not. Finally, it prints 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on this condition.
