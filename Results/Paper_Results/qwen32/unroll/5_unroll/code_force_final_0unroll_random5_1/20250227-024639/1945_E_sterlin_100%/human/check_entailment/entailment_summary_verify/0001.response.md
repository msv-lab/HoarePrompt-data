### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided code only defines input functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5`) and does not contain any logic to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the code does not implement any strategy to manipulate the permutation array `p` to ensure that after performing the binary search, `p[l]` is equal to `x`.

Here are the key points that support the original assessment:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The problem requires manipulating the permutation array `p` to ensure that after performing binary search, `p[l]` is equal to `x`. This involves performing at most 2 swaps.

2. **Binary Search Process**: The binary search process is clearly defined in the problem description, and the goal is to ensure that `p[l] = x` after the search.

3. **Strategy**: The strategy involves placing `x` in a position such that all elements before it are less than or equal to `x`, and all elements after it are greater than `x`.

4. **Provided Code Analysis**: The provided code only includes functions to read input data (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5`). There is no logic implemented to manipulate the array `p` or perform the binary search to ensure `p[l] = x`.

Since the provided code does not contain any logic to solve the problem, the original assessment is accurate.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct, and the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
