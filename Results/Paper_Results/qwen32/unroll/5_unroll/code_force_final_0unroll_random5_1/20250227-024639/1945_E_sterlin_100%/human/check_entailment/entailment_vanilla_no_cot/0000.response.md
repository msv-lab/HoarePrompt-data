Correctness: **False**

The provided code defines input reading functions but does not implement the logic to solve the problem. The task requires determining the number of swaps needed to make a permutation suitable for binary search to find a specific number, and then outputting the swaps. The given code snippet does not perform any operations to achieve this goal.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to implement logic to:

1. Identify the position of `x` in the permutation.
2. Determine the necessary swaps to ensure that after performing the binary search, `p_l` equals `x`.
3. Output the number of swaps and the swaps themselves.

Since the provided code does not contain this logic, it is incorrect for the given problem.
