Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to manipulate a permutation array `p` of length `n` so that after performing binary search, the element at index `l` is equal to `x`. We are allowed to perform at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

### Binary Search Process

The binary search process is defined as follows:
1. Initialize `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`.
2. While `r - l > 1`:
   - Compute `m = floor((r + l) / 2)`.
   - If `p[m] <= x`, set `l = m`.
   - Otherwise, set `r = m`.

The goal is to ensure that `p[l] = x` after the binary search process.

### Strategy

To ensure the binary search ends with `p[l] = x`:
- We need to place `x` at a position that will be the final `l` after the binary search.
- This typically means placing `x` in a position such that all elements before it are less than or equal to `x`, and all elements after it are greater than `x`.

### Provided Program Analysis

The provided code only defines input functions and does not implement any logic to solve the problem. The code does not contain any logic to manipulate the array `p` or perform the binary search to ensure `p[l] = x`.

### Conclusion

Since the provided program does not contain any logic to solve the problem as described, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
