### Reasoning:
Let's break down the logic of the program step-by-step to verify if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1()` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_2()` reads the values `n` (length of the permutation) and `x` (the number to be found) for each test case.
   - `func_3()` reads the permutation `p` as a list of integers.

2. **Mapping and Initialization**:
   - A dictionary `num_indx` is created to map each number in the permutation to its index (1-based).
   - A list `seen` is initialized to keep track of which elements have been "seen" during the binary search.
   - Variables `left` and `right` are initialized to 0 and `n` respectively, representing the bounds of the binary search.

3. **Binary Search Simulation**:
   - The binary search is simulated using a while loop that continues until `right - left = 1`.
   - During each iteration, the middle index `mid` is calculated.
   - The element at `p[mid]` is marked as "seen" in the `seen` list.
   - Depending on whether `p[mid]` is less than or equal to `x`, either `left` or `right` is updated.

4. **Result Determination**:
   - If after the loop `p[left] == x`, it means the element `x` is already at the correct position, so no swaps are needed.
   - If `x` has not been seen during the binary search (`not seen[x - 1]`), it means `x` is not in the range `[p[left], p[mid-1]]` or `[p[mid+1], p[right-1]]`, so only one swap is needed to bring `x` into the correct position.
   - If `x` has been seen, it means `x` is within the range, but `p[left]` is not `x`. In this case, two swaps are needed to bring `x` into the correct position.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the binary search simulation and determines the necessary swaps based on the conditions described.
- It ensures that the number of swaps is at most 2, as required by the problem statement.
- The output format matches the problem's requirements, providing the number of swaps followed by the indices of the swaps if any.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem by simulating the binary search and determining the necessary swaps to ensure that `p[left]` is equal to `x` after the binary search is executed.

**Correctness: True**
