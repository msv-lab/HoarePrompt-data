### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to manipulate a permutation array `p` such that after performing a binary search, the element at index `l` is equal to `x`. We are allowed to perform at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

#### Binary Search Process:
The binary search process is defined as:
1. Initialize `l = 0` and `r = n`.
2. While `r - l > 1`:
   - Compute `m = floor((r + l) / 2)`.
   - If `p[m] <= x`, set `l = m`.
   - Otherwise, set `r = m`.

The goal is to ensure that `p[l] = x` after the binary search process.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided code includes input reading functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) and the main logic for solving the problem:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `t = func_1()`: Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `(n, x) = func_2()`: Reads `n` (length of permutation) and `x` (number to be found).
     - `p = func_3()`: Reads the permutation array `p`.

2. **Constructing Index Mapping:**
   - `num_indx = {num: indx + 1 for (indx, num) in enumerate(p)}`: Creates a dictionary mapping each number in `p` to its 1-based index.
   - `seen = [0] * n`: Initializes a list to keep track of which numbers have been seen during the binary search.

3. **Binary Search Simulation:**
   - `left = 0` and `right = n`: Initializes the binary search boundaries.
   - `while left + 1 < right`: Runs the binary search loop.
     - `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`: Computes the middle index.
     - `seen[p[mid] - 1] = 1`: Marks the number at the middle index as seen.
     - If `p[mid] <= x`, set `left = mid`; otherwise, set `right = mid`.

4. **Post-Binary Search Logic:**
   - If `p[left] == x`, print `0` (no swaps needed).
   - If `x` was not seen during the binary search (`not seen[x - 1]`), print `1` and the swap to place `x` at the correct position.
   - Otherwise, reset the seen status of `p[left]` and find the first unseen number to perform two swaps to place `x` at the correct position.

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- `num_indx` is correctly mapping each number to its 1-based index.
- `seen` is used to track which numbers have been encountered during the binary search.
- The binary search logic correctly updates `left` and `right` based on the comparison with `x`.
- The post-binary search logic correctly determines the number of swaps needed and prints the appropriate swaps.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to manipulate the permutation array `p` using at most 2 swaps so that after performing binary search, `p[l] = x`. The annotations confirm that the program's behavior aligns with the intended solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
