The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is the loop variable and it is initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so we do not need to adjust it before the loop starts.

The state of `n`, the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `buffer` does not affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, `buffer` is an empty list**
