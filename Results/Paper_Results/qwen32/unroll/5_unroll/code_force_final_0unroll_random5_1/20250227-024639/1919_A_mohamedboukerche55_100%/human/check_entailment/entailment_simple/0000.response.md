### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, given that both players play optimally.

The key insight here is that the game's outcome can be determined by the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets. Here's why:

1. **Game Dynamics**:
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or not, but the critical action is removing a coin from the current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., has no coins left in their wallet) loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, the player who starts (Alice) can always mirror the other player's moves, ensuring that Bob is left with the last coin and thus loses.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of coins for Bob, forcing Bob into a losing position.

3. **Parity Check**:
   - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, the total number of coins is even, and Bob wins.
   - If `(a + b) % 2 != 0`, the total number of coins is odd, and Alice wins.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` for each test case and printing "Alice" or "Bob" accordingly.

### Correctness:

The program accurately reflects the game's rules and the optimal strategy based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
