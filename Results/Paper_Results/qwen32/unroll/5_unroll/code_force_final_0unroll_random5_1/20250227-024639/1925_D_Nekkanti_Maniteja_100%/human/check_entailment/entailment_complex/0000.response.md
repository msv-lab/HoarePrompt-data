The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. Let's break down the program and the problem to understand why.

### Problem Breakdown

The task is to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions, and then compute this value modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

1. **Friendship Value Calculation**:
   - If a pair of children are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 each time they are chosen.
   - If they are not friends, their friendship value remains 0.

2. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - Each pair has an equal probability of being chosen in each excursion.
   - The expected value is the sum of the friendship values over all excursions.

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
   - It then reads \( m \) lines of input, each containing \( u \), \( v \), and \( f \).

2. **Calculations**:
   - The program calculates \( c \) as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \( M \). This is the probability of choosing any specific pair of children.
   - It initializes \( s \) (the sum of expected friendship values) and \( a \) (the sum of initial friendship values).
   - It sums up all initial friendship values \( f \) into \( a \).
   - It then iterates \( k \) times, updating \( s \) in each iteration. The update formula is incorrect.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final value of \( s \) modulo \( M \).

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Update Formula**:
   - The formula used to update \( s \) in the loop is incorrect. The expected value calculation involves the sum of an arithmetic series for each pair of friends, which is not correctly implemented.
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly account for the increasing friendship values over multiple excursions.

2. **Handling of Non-Friends**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the fact that non-friend pairs have a friendship value of 0 and do not change.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values should be calculated considering the probability of each pair being chosen and the increasing friendship values for friend pairs.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, you need to:

1. Calculate the expected contribution of each friend pair to the sum over \( k \) excursions.
2. Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to account for the increasing friendship values.
3. Sum the contributions of all friend pairs and calculate the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the required calculations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
