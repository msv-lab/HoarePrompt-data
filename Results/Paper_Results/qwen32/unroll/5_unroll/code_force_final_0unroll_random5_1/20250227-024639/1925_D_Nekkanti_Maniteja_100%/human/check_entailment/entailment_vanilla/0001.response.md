Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown:
The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions, where each pair's friendship value increases by 1 if they are chosen as friends. The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) and the answer should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of children \(n\), the number of friend pairs \(m\), and the number of excursions \(k\).
   - It then reads the friend pairs and their initial friendship values.

2. **Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - It computes the modular inverse of this total number of pairs modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It sums up the initial friendship values of all friend pairs.
   - For each excursion, it calculates the contribution to the sum of friendship values. The program seems to be trying to calculate the expected increase in friendship values over all excursions.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of the calculation modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
- The loop `for i in range(k):` is incorrectly implemented. The expected value calculation involves the probability of choosing a specific pair and the cumulative effect of friendship value increases over multiple excursions, which is not correctly captured by the current implementation.
- The formula used in the loop `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly represent the expected value calculation.

### Correct Approach:
- The expected value for each friend pair can be calculated using the probability of being chosen in each excursion and the cumulative increase in friendship values.
- The expected value for a non-friend pair is always 0.
- The final expected value is the sum of the expected values of all friend pairs, which needs to be expressed as a fraction and then converted to the required modular form.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
