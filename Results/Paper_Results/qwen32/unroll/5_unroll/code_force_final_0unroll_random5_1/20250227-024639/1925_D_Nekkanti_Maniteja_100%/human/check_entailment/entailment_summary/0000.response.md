Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The program calculates the expected value incorrectly. The expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions involves the probability of selecting a friend pair and the cumulative increase in their friendship value.
   - The correct approach involves calculating the expected contribution of each friend pair to the total sum over `k` excursions. For each friend pair `(u, v)` with initial friendship value `f`, the expected value contribution of this pair is `f + (k-1)/2` if the pair is selected at least once. The probability of selecting any specific pair in each excursion is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
   - The program does not correctly account for the cumulative increase in friendship values over multiple excursions.

2. **Incorrect Formula Application**:
   - The program uses a formula that seems to be an incorrect attempt to calculate the expected value. The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is not consistent with the problem's requirements.
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, but it does not use this correctly in the context of calculating the expected value.

3. **Summation Over k**:
   - The program incorrectly sums over `k` without properly accounting for the increase in friendship values over multiple selections of the same pair.
   - The program does not correctly handle the probability of selecting a specific pair and the cumulative effect of increasing friendship values.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.

Correctness: **False**
