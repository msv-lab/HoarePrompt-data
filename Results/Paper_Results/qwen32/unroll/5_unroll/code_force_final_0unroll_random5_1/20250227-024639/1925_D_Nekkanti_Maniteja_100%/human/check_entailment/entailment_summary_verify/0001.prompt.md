You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a graph with `n` nodes and `m` edges, and an additional parameter `k`. For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on the edges' feature values and outputs the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown:
The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions, where each pair's friendship value increases by 1 if they are chosen as friends. The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) and the answer should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of children \(n\), the number of friend pairs \(m\), and the number of excursions \(k\).
   - It then reads the friend pairs and their initial friendship values.

2. **Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - It computes the modular inverse of this total number of pairs modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It sums up the initial friendship values of all friend pairs.
   - For each excursion, it calculates the contribution to the sum of friendship values. The program seems to be trying to calculate the expected increase in friendship values over all excursions.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of the calculation modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
- The loop `for i in range(k):` is incorrectly implemented. The expected value calculation involves the probability of choosing a specific pair and the cumulative effect of friendship value increases over multiple excursions, which is not correctly captured by the current implementation.
- The formula used in the loop `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly represent the expected value calculation.

### Correct Approach:
- The expected value for each friend pair can be calculated using the probability of being chosen in each excursion and the cumulative increase in friendship values.
- The expected value for a non-friend pair is always 0.
- The final expected value is the sum of the expected values of all friend pairs, which needs to be expressed as a fraction and then converted to the required modular form.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
