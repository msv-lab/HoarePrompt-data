### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

#### Problem Breakdown:
The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions. Specifically:
- For each excursion, a pair of children is chosen equiprobably.
- If the chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
- We need to find the expected sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions and express it as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), then compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem but contains significant logical errors:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case (`n`, `m`, `k`).
   - It also reads the friend pairs and their initial friendship values.

2. **Calculation Logic:**
   - The program calculates the total number of possible pairs of children, \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), and its modular inverse modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It sums up the initial friendship values of all friend pairs.
   - The loop `for i in range(k):` is intended to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions. However, the formula used inside the loop `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect.

3. **Issues in the Calculation:**
   - The correct approach involves calculating the expected value for each friend pair and summing these values.
   - For a friend pair with initial friendship value `f`, the expected value contribution over `k` excursions is more complex than what the program implements. The probability of choosing a specific pair in any given excursion is \(\frac{1}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\), and the expected increase in friendship value over `k` excursions needs to be considered.
   - The program mistakenly adds terms that do not accurately reflect the expected value calculation.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each friend pair, the expected number of times it is chosen in `k` excursions is \(\frac{k}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\).
   - The expected sum of friendship values for this pair over `k` excursions is the sum of the initial friendship value and the expected increase in friendship values.
   - The expected increase in friendship values for a pair chosen `x` times is the sum of the first `x` natural numbers, which is \(\frac{x(x+1)}{2}\).
   - The expected value for a pair with initial friendship value `f` is \(f + \frac{k}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \cdot \left(\frac{k}{2} + \frac{k}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\right)\).

5. **Implementation of Correct Approach:**
   - The program should correctly calculate the expected value for each friend pair and sum these values.
   - The final result should be expressed as a fraction and then converted to the required modular form.

#### Conclusion:
Given the significant logical errors in the provided program, it does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
