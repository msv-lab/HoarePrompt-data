Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided code does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The expected value calculation is incorrect. The code does not account for the fact that the friendship values increase over time if a pair is chosen. The current logic simply adds the initial friendship values and a linear term, which is not the correct way to compute the expected value.

2. **Handling of Friendship Values:**
   - The code does not update the friendship values as pairs are chosen. Each time a pair is chosen, its friendship value should increase by 1, and this should be reflected in the expected value calculation.

3. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The code uses `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` to represent the probability of choosing any specific pair. However, the way this probability is used in the loop is incorrect. The expected value should be computed by considering the probability of each pair being chosen and the updated friendship values.

4. **Loop Over k Excursions:**
   - The loop `for i in range(k):` is not correctly updating the expected value. The expected value should be computed by considering the cumulative effect of choosing pairs over k excursions, taking into account the updated friendship values.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

**Example:**

Input:
```
1
3 2 3
1 2 1
2 3 2
```

Expected Output:
```
14
```

Explanation:
- There are 3 children and 2 pairs of friends with initial friendship values.
- The pairs are (1, 2) with value 1 and (2, 3) with value 2.
- Over 3 excursions, the expected sum of friendship values can be calculated by considering the probability of choosing each pair and the updated friendship values.

The provided code does not correctly handle these updates and probability calculations, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
