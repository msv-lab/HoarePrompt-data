The provided code snippet is a function definition with a docstring, but it does not contain any executable code that modifies the variables `number` or `sequence`. Therefore, the values of `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged after the code is "executed."

Output State: **`number` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case.**
