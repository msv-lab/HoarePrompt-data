You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program seems to be attempting to generate a sequence that results in exactly `X` increasing subsequences, but there are a few issues that suggest it may not work correctly for all cases.

1. **Function `func_1` and its usage**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n - 1` as the argument, which seems to be an off-by-one error. The function should be called with `n` directly since the problem requires exactly `X` subsequences.
   
2. **Binary representation and sequence generation**:
   - The function `func_1` uses binary representation to generate the sequence. It calculates the number of increasing subsequences based on the binary representation of the number. However, the logic inside the function seems overly complex and might not handle all edge cases correctly, especially for very large values of `X` (up to \(10^{18}\)).

3. **Handling of large values of `X`**:
   - The function uses bit shifting operations to calculate the number of subsequences. While this is a common technique for such problems, the implementation details might not be robust enough to handle all edge cases, especially for very large values of `X`.

4. **Edge cases**:
   - The function `func_1` uses assertions and specific calculations based on the binary representation of the number, which might not cover all possible values of `X` correctly. For example, if `X` is a power of 2, the function might not generate the correct sequence.

5. **Output format**:
   - The program is supposed to output `-1` if it is impossible to find the required array. However, the provided code does not handle this case explicitly. It assumes that a valid sequence can always be generated for any `X` within the given range, which might not be true.

Given these points, it is likely that the program does not handle all edge cases correctly, especially for very large values of `X`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
