Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `number`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `sequence`, which is a list of integers where each integer X represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case. The function always returns the tuple (0, 0) regardless of the input values.**
