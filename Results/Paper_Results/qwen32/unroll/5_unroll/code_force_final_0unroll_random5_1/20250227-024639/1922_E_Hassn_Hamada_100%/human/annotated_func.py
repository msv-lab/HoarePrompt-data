#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `sequence`, a list of integers where each integer X represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case. The function modifies the `sequence` list by appending additional integers based on calculations involving `number` and the initial `sequence` values. However, the function always returns the tuple (0, 0) regardless of the input values.
