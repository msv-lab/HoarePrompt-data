The code provided calls a function `func_1` with the arguments `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` and `sequence`. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we cannot determine its internal behavior or the exact changes it makes to the variables. The only impact we can observe from the given code is the calculation of the first argument passed to `func_1`.

Given:
- `number` is a positive integer.
- `sequence` is a list of integers with an additional integer `2` appended to it.
- `size` is 3.
- `overlap` is 2.

The expression `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` can be simplified as:
- `1 << size` is equivalent to `1 << 3`, which is `8`.
- `1 << overlap` is equivalent to `1 << 2`, which is `4`.

Thus, the expression becomes `number - 8 + 4`, which simplifies to `number - 4`.

The variable `sequence` remains unchanged as it is passed to the function without any modifications in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers with an additional integer `2` appended to it, `size` is 3, `overlap` is 2, and `func_1` is called with the arguments `number - 4` and `sequence`.**
