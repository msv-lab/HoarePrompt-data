### Reasoning:
The given program is attempting to solve the problem by generating an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences. However, there are several issues with the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1` is not defined properly**:
    - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the sequence, but it incorrectly returns `0, 0` when `number == 0`. This return value is not used anywhere, and the function should be modifying the `sequence` list directly.
    - The function does not handle the case when `number` is not equal to 0 correctly. The loop that calculates `size` and `value` is flawed, and the logic for appending elements to the `sequence` list is incorrect.

2. **Incorrect logic for generating the sequence**:
    - The loop that calculates `size` and `value` is not correctly implemented. The condition `while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` is incorrect and will not work as intended.
    - The logic for appending elements to the `sequence` list is flawed. The loop `for i in range(size - overlap):` does not correctly append the required elements to the sequence.

3. **Recursive call to `func_1`**:
    - The recursive call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)` is not correctly updating the `number` value or the `sequence` list.

4. **Handling of input and output**:
    - The input is read correctly, but the function `func_1` is not being called with the correct parameters. The function should be called with the value of `n` (the number of increasing subsequences required) and an empty list to store the sequence.
    - The output is not being printed correctly. The function `func_1` should be modifying the `sequence` list, and the main loop should print the length and the elements of the `sequence` list.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to generate the required sequence. The function `func_1` is not defined correctly, and the logic for generating the sequence is flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
