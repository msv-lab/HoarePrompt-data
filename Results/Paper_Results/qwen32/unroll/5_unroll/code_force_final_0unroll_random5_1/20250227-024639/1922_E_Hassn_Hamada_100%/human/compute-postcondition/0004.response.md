The given code snippet initializes `size_overlap` with the tuple `(0, 0)`, but it does not modify `number` or `sequence`. Therefore, the values of `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`number` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case; `size_overlap` is `(0, 0)`**.
