In the given task, the `while` loop condition is simply `while b:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context, and a zero is considered `False`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `b` must be a non-zero integer.

Given the state right before the loop is that `a` and `b` are positive integers, `b` is already a non-zero integer, which means the loop can execute as is.

Thus, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers**
