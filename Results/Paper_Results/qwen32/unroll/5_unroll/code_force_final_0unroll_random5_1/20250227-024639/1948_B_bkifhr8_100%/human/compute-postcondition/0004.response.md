Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then checks if the list can be modified by repeatedly replacing a pair of adjacent elements with a new list formed by concatenating the digits of the larger element followed by the smaller element, such that the resulting list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If this condition can be met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".**
