The code snippet assigns the integer value of the user input to the variable `n`. The variables `t`, `l`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `n` and retains the initial values of `t`, `l`, and `s`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `l` and `s` are calculated for each test case and printed, `n` is an input integer.**
