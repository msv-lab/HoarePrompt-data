You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads multiple sets of integers from the standard input, processes each set by calling `func_1`, and prints the results of these calls, each on a new line.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the problem's requirement that the array can be split into two parts and the parts can be swapped to make the array non-decreasing. The code only checks if the array is already non-decreasing or if there is any pair of elements that are out of order. However, it does not consider if swapping any prefix and suffix can result in a non-decreasing array.

For example, consider the test case:
```
1
4
2 3 1 4
```
The array is not non-decreasing, but it can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into `x=[2, 3]` and `y=[1, 4]`, then swapping to get `y + x = [1, 4, 2, 3]`, which is still not non-decreasing. However, if we split it into `x=[2]` and `y=[3, 1, 4]`, then swapping gives `y + x = [3, 1, 4, 2]`, which is still not correct. But splitting into `x=[2, 3, 1]` and `y=[4]` then swapping gives `y + x = [4, 2, 3, 1]`, which is still incorrect. The correct split is actually `x=[2, 3]` and `y=[1, 4]` and then swapping gives `[1, 4, 2, 3]` which is incorrect, but the correct split is `x=[2]` and `y=[3, 1, 4]` and then swapping gives `[3, 1, 4, 2]` which is incorrect, but the correct split is `x=[2, 3, 1]` and `y=[4]` and then swapping gives `[4, 2, 3, 1]` which is incorrect, but the correct split is `x=[2, 3, 1, 4]` and `y=[]` and then swapping gives `[2, 3, 1, 4]` which is incorrect, but the correct split is `x=[2, 3]` and `y=[1, 4]` and then swapping gives `[1, 4, 2, 3]` which is incorrect, but the correct split is `x=[2]` and `y=[3, 1, 4]` and then swapping gives `[3, 1, 4, 2]` which is incorrect, but the correct split is `x=[2, 3, 1]` and `y=[4]` and then swapping gives `[4, 2, 3, 1]` which is incorrect, but the correct split is actually `x=[2, 3]` and `y=[1, 4]` and then swapping gives `[1, 4, 2, 3]` which is incorrect, but the correct split is `x=[2]` and `y=[3, 1, 4]` and then swapping gives `[3, 1, 4, 2]` which is incorrect, but the correct split is `x=[2, 3, 1]` and `y=[4]` and then swapping gives `[4, 2, 3, 1]` which is incorrect, but the correct split is actually `x=[2, 3, 1]` and `y=[4]` and then swapping gives `[4, 2, 3, 1]` which is incorrect, but the correct split is actually `x=[2, 3]` and `y=[1, 4]` and then swapping gives `[1, 4, 2, 3]` which is incorrect, but the correct split is actually `x=[2]` and `y=[3, 1, 4]` and then swapping gives `[3, 1, 4, 2]` which is incorrect, but the correct split is actually `x=[2]` and `y=[3, 1, 4]` and then swapping gives `[3, 1, 4, 2]` which is incorrect, but the correct split is actually `x=[2, 3]` and `y=[1, 4]` and then swapping gives `[1, 4, 2, 3]` which is incorrect, but the correct split is actually `x=[2]` and `y=[3, 1, 4]` and then swapping gives `[3, 1, 4, 2]` which is incorrect, but the correct split is actually `x=[2, 3, 1]` and `y=[4]` and then swapping gives `[4, 2, 3, 1]` which is incorrect, but the correct split is actually `x=[2, 3]` and `y=[1, 4]` and then swapping gives `[1, 4, 2, 3]` which is incorrect, but the correct split is actually `x=[2]` and `y=[3, 1, 4]` and then swapping gives `[3, 1, 4, 2]` which is incorrect.

The correct approach should involve checking if there is a point in the array where the array can be split into two parts such that the second part followed by the first part results in a non-decreasing array.

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        if all(arr[j] <= arr[j + 1] for j in range(i, n - 1)) and all(arr[j] <= arr[j + 1] for j in range(i - 1)):
            if i == 0 or arr[i - 1] <= arr[i]:
                return 'Yes'
    return 'No'
```

This function checks all possible split points to see if the array can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order by swapping the prefix and suffix.
