### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts and the parts are swapped. The key observation is that the array can be sorted if there exists a point in the array such that the suffix can be moved to the front and the resulting array is sorted.

#### Implementation Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
   - The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns "Yes".
   - If the array is not sorted, it checks if there is any element that is greater than the next element using the condition `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If such an element exists, it returns "No". Otherwise, it returns "Yes".

The critical issue here is that the function only checks if the array is already sorted or not. It does not consider the possibility of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them to achieve a sorted order.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them.

#### Correctness Analysis:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is insufficient. The function only checks if the array is already sorted, but it does not account for the possibility of splitting and swapping the array to achieve a sorted order.

For example, consider the second test case in the problem description:
- Input: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
- The function `func_1` would return "No" because the array is not sorted. However, by splitting the array into `[7, 9]` and `[2, 2, 3]` and swapping them, we get `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`, which is sorted.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect because it does not implement the correct logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations. It only checks if the array is sorted or not, which is insufficient.
Final: **False**
