Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks whether an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations that involve splitting the array into two parts and swapping those parts. The key observation here is that the only way the array can be sorted after such operations is if there is a point in the array where the sequence can be split such that the suffix is less than or equal to the prefix when swapped.

### Key Points:
1. If the array is already sorted, the answer is "Yes".
2. If there is a point in the array where the sequence can be split into two parts such that the suffix is less than or equal to the prefix when swapped, the answer is "Yes".
3. Otherwise, the answer is "No".

### Implementation Analysis:
Let's look at the provided code and see if it correctly implements the above logic.

#### Function `func_1(arr)`:
- This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
- If the array is sorted, it returns "Yes".
- If the array is not sorted, it checks if there is any element that is greater than the next element using the condition `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
- If such an element exists, it returns "No". Otherwise, it returns "Yes".

#### Function `func_2()`:
- This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case.
- It collects the results and prints them.

### Issues in the Implementation:
- The logic in `func_1` is incorrect. Just checking if there is any element greater than the next element is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations.
- The function does not check for the possibility of splitting the array into two parts such that swapping them results in a sorted array.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It only checks if the array is sorted or not, which is insufficient.

Thus, the Correctness is **False**.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations. It only checks if the array is sorted or not, which is insufficient.
Correctness: **False**
