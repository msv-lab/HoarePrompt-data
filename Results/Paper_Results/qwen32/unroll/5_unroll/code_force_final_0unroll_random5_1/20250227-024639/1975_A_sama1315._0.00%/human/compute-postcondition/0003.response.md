Output State: **`arr` is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 0; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**

Natural language: The variable `t` is assigned the integer value of the first element in the `data` list, which was obtained by splitting the input line. The values of `arr`, `data`, and `index` remain unchanged.
