You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads multiple sets of integers from the standard input, processes each set by calling `func_1`, and prints the results of these calls, each on a new line.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks whether an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations that involve splitting the array into two parts and swapping those parts. The key observation here is that the only way the array can be sorted after such operations is if there is a point in the array where the sequence can be split such that the suffix is less than or equal to the prefix when swapped.

### Key Points:
1. If the array is already sorted, the answer is "Yes".
2. If there is a point in the array where the sequence can be split into two parts such that the suffix is less than or equal to the prefix when swapped, the answer is "Yes".
3. Otherwise, the answer is "No".

### Implementation Analysis:
Let's look at the provided code and see if it correctly implements the above logic.

#### Function `func_1(arr)`:
- This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
- If the array is sorted, it returns "Yes".
- If the array is not sorted, it checks if there is any element that is greater than the next element using the condition `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
- If such an element exists, it returns "No". Otherwise, it returns "Yes".

#### Function `func_2()`:
- This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case.
- It collects the results and prints them.

### Issues in the Implementation:
- The logic in `func_1` is incorrect. Just checking if there is any element greater than the next element is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations.
- The function does not check for the possibility of splitting the array into two parts such that swapping them results in a sorted array.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It only checks if the array is sorted or not, which is insufficient.

Thus, the Correctness is **False**.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations. It only checks if the array is sorted or not, which is insufficient.
Correctness: **False**
