The provided code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of n positive integers, and `input` is `sys.stdin.read`. After executing the code, `data` is assigned the value of `input().split()`, which means `data` will be a list of strings, each string being a part of the input line separated by whitespace.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.**
