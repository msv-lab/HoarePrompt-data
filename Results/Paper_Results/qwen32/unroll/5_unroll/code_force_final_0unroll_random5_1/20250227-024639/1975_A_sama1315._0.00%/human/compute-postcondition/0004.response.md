Output State: **`arr` is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**

Natural language: The variable `index` has been incremented by 1, so its value is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
