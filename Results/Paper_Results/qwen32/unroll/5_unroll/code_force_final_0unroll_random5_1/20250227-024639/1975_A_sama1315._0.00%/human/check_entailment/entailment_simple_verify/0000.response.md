### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided code does not correctly handle the problem's requirement. The code only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order or if there is any pair of elements out of order. However, it does not consider the possibility of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them to achieve a non-decreasing order.

Let's break down the program and the annotations:

- **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
  - **Annotation**: The function checks if the array is in non-decreasing order using `all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`. If true, it returns 'Yes'.
  - **Annotation**: If the array is not in non-decreasing order, it checks if there is any pair of elements that are out of order using `any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`. If true, it returns 'No'.
  - **Annotation**: If the array is neither fully in non-decreasing order nor does it have any out-of-order pairs, it returns 'Yes'. This last condition is incorrect because it implies that the array can be sorted by swapping without any out-of-order pairs, which is not necessarily true.

- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - **Annotation**: This function reads input, processes each test case, and applies `func_1` to determine if the array can be sorted by swapping parts. It collects the results and prints them.

The annotations correctly highlight the issue with `func_1(arr)`. The function does not consider the possibility of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them to achieve a non-decreasing order. The original assessment provides a corrected version of `func_1(arr)` that checks all possible split points to see if the array can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order by swapping the prefix and suffix.

### Final Evaluation

Given the reasoning above, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
