Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining the maximum beauty of an array based on the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. To achieve the maximum beauty, the optimal strategy is to sort the array in ascending or descending order. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

Let's analyze the provided functions:

1. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
   - This function sorts the input array and calculates the beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The output hint for this function is misleading; it suggests that the function returns the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the sorted list, which is incorrect. The function actually returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - Given the problem's requirement, sorting the array and computing the sum of consecutive differences is the correct approach to find the maximum beauty.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of `n` integers.
   - It then calls `func_1(array)` to compute the maximum beauty for each test case and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The provided functions together correctly implement the solution to the problem. `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum beauty by sorting the array and summing the differences, and `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the results.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
