You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it processes the list of integers by calling `func_1`, presumably to compute some result, and then prints the result for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to ensure it meets the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Sasha wants to maximize the "beauty" of an array by rearranging its elements.
- The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} |a_i - a_{i-1}|\).

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(array)`**: This function sorts the array and then calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
2. **`func_2()`**: This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the array. Sorting the array in ascending or descending order will maximize the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The absolute differences will be maximized when the largest and smallest elements are adjacent in the sorted array, which is achieved by sorting.

2. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - The beauty is calculated by iterating through the sorted array and summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - Since the array is sorted, the absolute difference between consecutive elements is simply the difference, as the larger element will always come after the smaller one.

3. **Handling Input and Output**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the length of the array and the array elements, then calls `func_1` to compute the beauty and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- **All Elements Identical**: In the second example, all elements are 69. The beauty is correctly calculated as 0.
- **Two Elements**: In the last example, the array is [2, 1]. The beauty is correctly calculated as 1.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The function handles multiple test cases by iterating through the input data and processing each test case independently.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements. It also correctly handles multiple test cases and input/output operations.

Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program sorts the array to maximize the beauty and correctly calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. It also handles multiple test cases and input/output operations as required by the problem description.
