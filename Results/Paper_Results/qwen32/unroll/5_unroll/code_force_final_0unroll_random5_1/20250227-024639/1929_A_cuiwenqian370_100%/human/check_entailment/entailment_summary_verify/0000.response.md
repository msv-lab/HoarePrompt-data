### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its behavior against the problem description and function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Sasha wants to maximize the "beauty" of an array by rearranging its elements.
- The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} |a_i - a_{i-1}|\).

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(array)`**: This function sorts the array and then calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
2. **`func_2()`**: This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Function Summaries:
- **`func_1(array)`**: Sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
- **`func_2()`**: Reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results for each test case.

#### Correctness Check:

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order.
   - Sorting the array in ascending or descending order will indeed maximize the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements because the largest and smallest elements will be adjacent in the sorted array, maximizing the differences.

2. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - The beauty is calculated by iterating through the sorted array and summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - Since the array is sorted in ascending order, the absolute difference between consecutive elements is simply the difference, as the larger element will always come after the smaller one.

3. **Handling Input and Output**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the length of the array and the array elements, then calls `func_1` to compute the beauty and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

#### Edge Cases Considered:
- **All Elements Identical**: In the second example, all elements are 69. The beauty is correctly calculated as 0.
- **Two Elements**: In the last example, the array is [2, 1]. The beauty is correctly calculated as 1.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The function handles multiple test cases by iterating through the input data and processing each test case independently.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements. It also correctly handles multiple test cases and input/output operations as required by the problem description.

### Validation of Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the problem and the program:
- Sorting the array to maximize the beauty.
- Calculating the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
- Handling multiple test cases and input/output operations.

Since the original assessment accurately captures the correctness of the program and its behavior, we can maintain the original assessment.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
