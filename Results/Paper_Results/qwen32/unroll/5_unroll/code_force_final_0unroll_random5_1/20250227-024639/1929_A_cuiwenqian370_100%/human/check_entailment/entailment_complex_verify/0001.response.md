### Reasoning:
The original assessment is mostly accurate, but there is a subtle issue with the logic used in `func_1` to calculate the beauty of the array. The assessment claims that sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements will maximize the beauty, but this is not entirely correct.

To maximize the beauty, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, we should aim to maximize the sum of these absolute differences. Sorting the array in ascending or descending order indeed maximizes the differences between consecutive elements, but the calculation of beauty in `func_1` is incorrect. The beauty should be calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, not just the difference between the first and last elements.

Let's re-evaluate `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty
```

The annotations state:
- **State after sorting**: `array` is a sorted list of integers.
- **Beauty calculation**: The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

This is correct. The beauty should indeed be the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, not just the difference between the first and last elements.

### Correctness:
- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the beauty.
- **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty is correctly calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
- **Processing Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading input, processing each test case using `func_1`, and storing the results.
- **Output**: The results for each test case are printed in the correct order.

Given this corrected understanding, the logic and implementation of the program are correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.

Final: **True**
