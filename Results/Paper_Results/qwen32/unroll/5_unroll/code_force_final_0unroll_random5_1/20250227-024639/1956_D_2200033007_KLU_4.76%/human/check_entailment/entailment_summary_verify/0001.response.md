Reasoning:

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the program. Let's break down the reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input values but does not convert the string elements of `na` to integers. This is necessary for any calculations or comparisons involving the array elements. The array `a` should contain integers, not strings.

2. **Hardcoded Outputs**: The function `func_1` only handles a specific case where the length of the array is 2, printing a fixed output of `4 1` and `1 2`, which is only correct for the specific case of the array `[0, 1]`. For all other cases, it prints `13 0`, which is not a general solution and is only correct for the specific example `[1, 3, 9]`.

3. **Lack of MEX Calculation and Operations**: The program does not implement the logic to compute the MEX of any subarray or to perform the operations as described in the problem statement. It does not attempt to maximize the sum of the array based on the given rules.

4. **General Case Handling**: The program does not handle the general case where the length of the array can be any value between 1 and 18, and the elements can be any integer between 0 and 10^7. It fails to provide a solution for a wide range of input scenarios.

Given these issues, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible input cases.

Final: **False**
