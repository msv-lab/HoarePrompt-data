The given print statement is `print(f'13 0')`. This is a formatted string literal (f-string) that directly contains the values '13' and '0' separated by a space. The values '13' and '0' are explicitly provided in the string and do not depend on any variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the string '13 0'.

Output: **13 0**
