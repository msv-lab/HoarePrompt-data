**Reasoning:**

The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing the MEX operation. Instead, it only handles two specific cases based on the length of the array and outputs fixed results without considering the actual values in the array or performing any operations.

Here are the specific points of analysis based on the annotated code and the problem description:

1. **Handling of Input:**
   - The program reads the input and converts it into a list of strings, but it does not convert these strings into integers. This could lead to incorrect operations if the program were to perform any calculations.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the length of the list `a` instead of the list `a` itself. This is a significant issue because the program needs to access the actual values in the array to perform the MEX operation.

2. **Logic of the Program:**
   - The program only checks if the length of the array is 2. If it is, it outputs `4 1` and `1 2`. This is correct for the specific case where the array has two elements and the MEX operation can be used to maximize the sum.
   - For all other cases (length not equal to 2), the program outputs `13 0`. This is incorrect because it does not compute the MEX value for any subarray and does not consider the actual values in the array. The correct output varies based on the input array, and the program fails to provide the correct maximum sum and sequence of operations for these cases.

3. **Examples Analysis:**
   - **First Example:** The program correctly outputs `4 1\n1 2` for the input `2\n0 1`, which is the correct sequence of operations to maximize the sum.
   - **Second Example:** The program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect because the initial sum `1 + 3 + 9 = 13` is already the maximum sum, but the program does not handle this case correctly by outputting `0` operations.
   - **Third Example:** The program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect because the maximum sum is `105` with two operations.
   - **Fourth Example:** The program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect because the maximum sum is `1` with one operation.

Given these points, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

**Final: False** (The program is incorrect as it does not provide the correct output for all cases.)
