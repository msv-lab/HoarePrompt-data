### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing the MEX operation. The program only handles two specific cases (when the length of the array is 2 and when it is not 2) and outputs fixed results without considering the actual values in the array or performing any operations.

Let's break down the issues using the annotated code and the examples provided:

1. **First Example:**
   - Input: `2\n0 1`
   - Expected Output: `4 1\n1 2`
   - Actual Output: `4 1\n1 2`
   - The program correctly handles this case by outputting `4 1` and the operation `1 2`, which is correct as the MEX of `[0, 1]` is `2`, and setting the entire array to `2` results in `[2, 2]` with a sum of `4`.

2. **Second Example:**
   - Input: `3\n1 3 9`
   - Expected Output: `13 0`
   - Actual Output: `13 0`
   - The program correctly handles this case by outputting `13 0` since the initial sum of the array `[1, 3, 9]` is already `13`, and no operations are needed to maximize it.

3. **Third Example:**
   - Input: `4\n1 100 2 1`
   - Expected Output: `105 2\n3 3\n3 4`
   - Actual Output: `13 0`
   - The program incorrectly outputs `13 0` because it does not perform any operations on the array. The correct operations would be to set `a[3]` to `0` (MEX of `[2]` is `0`), resulting in `[1, 100, 0, 1]`, and then set `a[3]` and `a[4]` to `2` (MEX of `[0, 1]` is `2`), resulting in `[1, 100, 2, 2]` with a sum of `105`.

4. **Fourth Example:**
   - Input: `1\n0`
   - Expected Output: `1 1\n1 1`
   - Actual Output: `13 0`
   - The program incorrectly outputs `13 0` because it does not perform any operations on the array. The correct operation would be to set `a[1]` to `1` (MEX of `[0]` is `1`), resulting in `[1]` with a sum of `1`.

The program fails to compute the correct maximum sum and the sequence of operations for arrays of length other than 2. It simply outputs predefined results based on the length of the array, which is incorrect for all cases except the first example where the length is 2.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
