Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of finding the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The program counts combinations of sticks without checking the triangle inequality condition, which is essential for forming a non-degenerate triangle.

For three lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(a \leq b \leq c\)), they can form a non-degenerate triangle if and only if \(a + b > c\). The program does not implement this check, so it may incorrectly count combinations that do not satisfy the triangle inequality.

Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of the necessary steps to solve the problem correctly:
1. Read the input values.
2. For each test case, read the number of sticks and their corresponding powers of 2.
3. Sort the lengths of the sticks.
4. Use a triple nested loop or a more efficient method (like two pointers) to check all combinations of three sticks and count those that satisfy the triangle inequality.
5. Print the result for each test case.

A correct implementation would include the triangle inequality check to ensure the chosen sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.
