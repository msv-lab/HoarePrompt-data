Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `results` is an empty list.**

This means that the `test_cases` list remains unchanged, and a new empty list `results` has been initialized.
