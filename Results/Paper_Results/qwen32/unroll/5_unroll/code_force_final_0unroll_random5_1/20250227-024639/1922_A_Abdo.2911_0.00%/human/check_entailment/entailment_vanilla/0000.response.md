Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n`, and then the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction:**
   - For each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the program constructs a character of the template:
     - If `a[i]` is the same as `b[i]`, the character at position `i` in the template is set to `a[i]` (lowercase).
     - If `a[i]` is different from `b[i]`, the character at position `i` in the template is set to the uppercase version of `a[i]`.

3. **Matching Check for `a` and `b`:**
   - The program then checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template:
     - If the template character is lowercase, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are equal to the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.

4. **Mismatch Check for `c`:**
   - The program checks if `c` does not match the constructed template:
     - If the template character is lowercase, it checks if `c[i]` is equal to the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it checks if `c[i]` is different from the lowercase version of the template character.

5. **Output:**
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Evaluation:
- The logic for constructing the template and checking the conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c` appears to be correct based on the problem description.
- The program handles the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement accurately.
- The program correctly processes each test case independently and provides the appropriate output.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

**Correctness: True**
