### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem by following these steps:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program first reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Creation**: For each position `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the program creates a template character based on the characters at the same position in `a` and `b`:
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the template character at position `i` is set to `a[i]` (lowercase).
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, the template character at position `i` is set to the uppercase version of `a[i]`.

3. **Matching Check for `a` and `b`**: The program then checks if both `a` and `b` match the template:
   - If the template character is lowercase, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` must match the template character.
   - If the template character is uppercase, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` must not match the lowercase version of the template character.

4. **Matching Check for `c`**: The program checks if `c` does not match the template:
   - If the template character is lowercase, `c[i]` must match the template character.
   - If the template character is uppercase, `c[i]` must not match the lowercase version of the template character.

5. **Output**: Based on the results of the matching checks, the program prints 'YES' if both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly derives the template based on the comparison of `a` and `b` and then checks the matching conditions for both `a`, `b`, and `c`.
