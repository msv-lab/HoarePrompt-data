### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's correctness based on the provided problem description, code, and function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
- Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

The template `t` can have lowercase or uppercase letters:
- If the i-th letter of `t` is lowercase, the i-th letter of `a` and `b` must match `t`'s i-th letter.
- If the i-th letter of `t` is uppercase, the i-th letter of `a` and `b` must differ from the lowercase version of `t`'s i-th letter.
- For string `c`, at least one of these conditions must fail.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. For each character in strings `a` and `b`:
   - If the characters are the same, add the lowercase version of the character to the template.
   - If the characters are different, add the uppercase version of the character to the template.
2. Check if `a` and `b` match the template:
   - If the template character is lowercase, ensure `a` and `b` have the same character.
   - If the template character is uppercase, ensure `a` and `b` have different characters.
3. Check if `c` does not match the template:
   - If the template character is lowercase, ensure `c` has the same character.
   - If the template character is uppercase, ensure `c` has a different character.
4. Print "YES" if both conditions are satisfied for a test case, otherwise print "NO".

#### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it constructs a template based on the comparison of characters in `a` and `b`. It then checks if `a` and `b` match the template and if `c` does not match the template, printing "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

#### Edge Cases:
1. **All characters in `a` and `b` are the same**:
   - Template will be all lowercase.
   - If `c` has any character different from `a` and `b`, the condition will hold.
2. **All characters in `a` and `b` are different**:
   - Template will be all uppercase.
   - If `c` has any character the same as `a` or `b`, the condition will hold.
3. **Mixed characters in `a` and `b`**:
   - Template will have a mix of uppercase and lowercase.
   - The condition will hold if `c` violates the template for at least one character.

#### Testing the Program:
Let's consider the provided examples:

- **Example 1**:
  - `n = 1`, `a = "a"`, `b = "b"`, `c = "c"`
  - Template: "A"
  - `a` and `b` match the template.
  - `c` does not match the template.
  - Output: "YES" (Correct)

- **Example 2**:
  - `n = 2`, `a = "aa"`, `b = "bb"`, `c = "aa"`
  - Template: "AA"
  - `a` and `b` match the template.
  - `c` matches the template.
  - Output: "NO" (Correct)

- **Example 3**:
  - `n = 10`, `a = "mathforces"`, `b = "luckforces"`, `c = "adhoccoder"`
  - Template: "CODEforces"
  - `a` and `b` match the template.
  - `c` does not match the template.
  - Output: "YES" (Correct)

- **Example 4**:
  - `n = 3`, `a = "acc"`, `b = "abd"`, `c = "abc"`
  - Template: "aBd"
  - `a` and `b` match the template.
  - `c` matches the template.
  - Output: "NO" (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and produces the expected output for the provided examples. The function summary accurately describes the program's behavior, which aligns with the problem requirements.

**Final: True**
