To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given loop and its effect on the variables. The loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

Here, `t` is an input integer, and `func_1()` is a function call that is executed `t` times.

Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable (indicated by the underscore), it does not affect any state outside the loop. The function `func_1()` is called `t` times, but its effect on the state is not specified in the problem statement. Therefore, we can only make assumptions about the variables that are explicitly mentioned in the loop head and body.

Given that there are no other variables mentioned in the loop head and body that are being modified, and the function `func_1()` does not affect any variables outside its scope (unless specified, which it is not), the only variable that could potentially change is `t`. However, `t` is used as an input to the `range()` function and is not modified within the loop.

Thus, the state of `t` remains unchanged after the loop executes.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer.**
