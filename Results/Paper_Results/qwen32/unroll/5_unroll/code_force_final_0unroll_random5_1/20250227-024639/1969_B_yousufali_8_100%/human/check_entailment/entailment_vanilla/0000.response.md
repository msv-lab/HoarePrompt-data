Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift operation on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

### Key Observations:
1. **Sorting a Binary String**: A binary string is sorted in non-descending order if all `0`s are to the left of all `1`s.
2. **Cyclic Shifts**: Performing a cyclic shift on a substring can move `1`s to the left and `0`s to the right, but the key is to understand how the cost is associated with these shifts.

### Cost Calculation:
- **Counting `1`s**: When we encounter a `0` in the string after encountering a `1`, it implies that this `0` needs to be moved to the left of the `1`s. The cost to move this `0` is equivalent to the number of `1`s encountered so far plus one (to account for the shift operation).
- **Summing Costs**: The total cost is the sum of the costs of moving each `0` encountered after the first `1`.

### Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - It reads a binary string `s`.
  - It initializes `n` (count of `1`s encountered) and `ans` (total cost).
  - It iterates through the string:
    - If it encounters a `1`, it increments `n`.
    - If it encounters a `0` and `n` is not zero (meaning there have been `1`s before), it adds `n + 1` to `ans` (the cost to move this `0` to the left of the `1`s).
  - It prints the total cost `ans`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Correctness Verification:
The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string by counting the cost of moving each `0` encountered after the first `1`. This aligns with the problem's requirement to minimize the total cost of cyclic shifts.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts.

Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the minimum cost by summing up the costs of moving each `0` encountered after the first `1` in the string, which corresponds to the number of `1`s encountered so far plus one.

Correctness: **True**
