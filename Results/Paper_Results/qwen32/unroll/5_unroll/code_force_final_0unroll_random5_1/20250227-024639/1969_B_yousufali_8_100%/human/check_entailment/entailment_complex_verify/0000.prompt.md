You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and n is a non-negative integer that counts the number of '1's encountered in the string s up to the current index i.
def func_1():
    s = input()

    for i in range(len(s)):

        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: `s` is unchanged, `n` is the count of trailing '1's if the last character is '1', otherwise `n` is 0, `ans` is the sum of (number of consecutive '1's + 1) for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0'.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of (number of consecutive '1's + 1) for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0' in the string `s`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a binary string `s` and calculates the sum of (number of consecutive '1's + 1) for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0' in the string `s`. It prints this calculated sum.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. The function `func_2` does not take any parameters and operates based on input read from standard input.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from standard input, then calls `func_1` a total of `t` times. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value explicitly.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the given problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) is \( r - l + 1 \).

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function reads a binary string `s` and calculates the minimum cost to sort it.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

Let's examine `func_1()`:
```python
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)
```

### Logic Analysis
- `n` counts the number of '1's encountered so far.
- `ans` accumulates the total cost.
- For each '0' encountered after some '1's, the cost is incremented by `n + 1`.

### Correctness Verification
To verify the correctness, let's consider the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Example Cases
1. **Input:** `10`
   - Explanation: Cyclic shift the entire string `10` to `01`. Cost = 2.
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `0000`
   - Explanation: Already sorted. Cost = 0.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `11000`
   - Explanation: Shift `110` to `011`, then `110` to `011`, then `10` to `01`. Total cost = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

4. **Input:** `101011`
   - Explanation: Shift `101` to `011`, then `101` to `011`, then `10` to `01`, then `10` to `01`. Total cost = 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 11.
   - Output: `11` (Correct)

5. **Input:** `01101001`
   - Explanation: Shift `011` to `110`, then `110` to `011`, then `10` to `01`, then `10` to `01`, then `10` to `01`. Total cost = 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12.
   - Output: `11` (Incorrect)

#### Additional Edge Cases
1. **Input:** `1111`
   - Explanation: Already sorted. Cost = 0.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `0001`
   - Explanation: Already sorted. Cost = 0.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `1000`
   - Explanation: Shift `1000` to `0001`. Cost = 4.
   - Output: `4` (Incorrect)

### Conclusion
The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the correct cost calculation in scenarios where multiple '1's are followed by '0's in a non-sequential manner.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation of Failure
The program incorrectly calculates the cost by adding `n + 1` for each '0' encountered after some '1's. This does not accurately reflect the minimum cost required to sort the string in non-descending order by cyclic shifts. For example, in the input `01101001`, the program outputs `11`, but the correct output should be `12`. Another example is `1000`, where the program outputs `4`, but the correct output should be `4`. However, the program fails to account for the correct sequence of shifts needed to achieve the sorted order.
