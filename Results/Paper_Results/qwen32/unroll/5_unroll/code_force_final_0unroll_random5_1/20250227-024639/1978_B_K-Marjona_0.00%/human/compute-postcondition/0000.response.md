For the given task, the loop head consists of the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are defined inside the loop, so they cannot be adjusted in the state before the loop starts. 

The only state that needs to be adjusted is the input that will be provided to the `input()` function, which should ensure that the loop executes the correct number of times (`t` times).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `int(input())` times.
2. To ensure the loop executes `t` times, the input to `input()` should be `t`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the input to `input()` is `t`.

State: **`t` is the number of test cases and the input to `input()` should be `t`**.

Given the format, the state should be:

State: **`t` is the number of test cases, and the input to `input()` is `t`**.
