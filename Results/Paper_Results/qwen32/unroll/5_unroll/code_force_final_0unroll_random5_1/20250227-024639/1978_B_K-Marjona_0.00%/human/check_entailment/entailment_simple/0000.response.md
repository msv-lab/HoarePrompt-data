### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given promotion rules. The key is to find the optimal \( k \), the number of buns to sell at the modified price, to maximize the total revenue.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).

2. **Optimal \( k \) Calculation**:
   - The program calculates \( k \) as \( \min(n, b - a) \). This ensures that \( k \) does not exceed the number of buns \( n \) or the difference between the modified price of the first bun and the usual price \( a \).

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If \( b \le a \), it means the modified price is not beneficial, so all buns are sold at the usual price \( a \). The total profit is \( n \times a \).
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the profit from the first \( k \) buns sold at the modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns sold at the usual price. The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \left(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2}\right) \times k + (n - k) \times a
     \]
     This formula calculates the sum of the arithmetic series for the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and adds the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the calculated profit for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The logic and implementation of the program are correct. It handles all edge cases, including when \( b \le a \) and when \( k = 0 \). The arithmetic series sum formula is correctly applied to compute the profit from the first \( k \) buns.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
