Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description at all. The problem description asks for a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` that processes subfolders within the current directory, checks if the folder names are within a specified range, and then generates specific files for `.html` files found within those folders. 

However, the given program defines a function `func_1()` that reads input values and performs a completely different task. It does not implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
