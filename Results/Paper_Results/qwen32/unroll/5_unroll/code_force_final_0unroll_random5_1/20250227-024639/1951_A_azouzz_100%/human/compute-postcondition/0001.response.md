The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which determines the number of times the loop will execute. The variables `start` and `end` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted for the loop execution.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. The initial values of `start` and `end` do not affect the execution of the loop, as they are not used in the loop head.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
