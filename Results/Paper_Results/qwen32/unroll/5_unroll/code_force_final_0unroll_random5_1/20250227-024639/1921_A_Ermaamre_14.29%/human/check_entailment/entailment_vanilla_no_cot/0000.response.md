To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze it step by step.

The problem states that we need to find the area of a square given its four corners, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The area of a square can be calculated as the square of the side length. The side length can be found by taking the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners.

The provided program attempts to identify two pairs of equal x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) to determine the side length of the square. However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. The program only checks for three specific cases of x-coordinate equality, but it doesn't account for all possible configurations of the corners. For example, it doesn't check if `x1 == x4` and `x2 == x3` (which is a valid configuration).

2. The program uses `if y1 < y3` (or similar) to determine the side length, but this is unnecessary since the absolute difference `abs(y3 - y1)` (or `abs(y2 - y1)`) will always give the correct side length, regardless of the order of y-values.

3. The program doesn't handle all possible configurations of the square's corners, which could lead to incorrect results for some inputs.

To fix these issues, a more robust approach would be to sort the x and y coordinates and then calculate the side length based on the differences between the smallest and second smallest (or largest and second largest) values.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        points = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(4)]
        x_coords = sorted([point[0] for point in points])
        y_coords = sorted([point[1] for point in points])
        side_length = abs(x_coords[1] - x_coords[0])  # or abs(y_coords[1] - y_coords[0])
        print(side_length ** 2)

func()
```

Given these points, the original program does not cover all possible configurations and may produce incorrect results for some inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
