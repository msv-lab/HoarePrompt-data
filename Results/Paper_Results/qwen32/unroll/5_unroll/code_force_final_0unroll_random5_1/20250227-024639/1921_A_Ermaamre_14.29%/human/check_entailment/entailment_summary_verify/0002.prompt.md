You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It then calculates and prints the area of each square.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the area of the square based on the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers, representing the coordinates of the corners of the square.

2. **Logic to Determine Side Length:**
   - The program attempts to determine the side length of the square by checking different pairs of x-coordinates.
   - It checks three possible pairs of x-coordinates:
     - `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`
     - `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`
     - `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`
   - For each pair, it calculates the absolute difference in the y-coordinates to determine the side length.

3. **Calculation of Area:**
   - Once the side length is determined, it squares this value to get the area of the square and prints it.

### Correctness Check:

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic to determine the side length is based on the assumption that two of the x-coordinates will be the same for the vertical sides of the square, and the other two will be the same for the horizontal sides.
  - The program correctly identifies the side length by calculating the absolute difference in y-coordinates when two x-coordinates are the same.
  - The area is correctly calculated by squaring the side length.

- **Handling Different Test Cases:**
  - The program handles multiple test cases by iterating through the number of test cases specified by the input.
  - It processes each test case independently and prints the result for each.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program should correctly handle squares of different sizes and positions on the coordinate plane, including squares with negative coordinates.
  - The problem guarantees that the input will always form a valid square with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes, so the program does not need to handle invalid inputs.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the side length of the square and calculates the area based on the given coordinates. It handles multiple test cases and edge cases appropriately.
