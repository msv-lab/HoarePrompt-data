Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and deleting them.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
- The goal is to find the final score (MEX of `c`) if both play optimally.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `T` (number of test cases).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (size of the array) and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `a` is sorted. This is a good step as it helps in easily finding the smallest missing number.

3. **Tracking Elements:**
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences of each number in `a`.
   - A variable `cur` is used to track the current MEX.

4. **Finding MEX:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `a` and updates `cur` based on the smallest number not present in `a` up to that point.
   - If a number is greater than `cur + 1`, it means there's a gap, and `cur` is updated to `cur + 1`.
   - If the sum of counts in `M` equals `n`, it means all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present, so `cur` is incremented by 1.
   
5. **Handling Special Case:**
   - The program checks if there are at least two numbers in `M` with a count of 1. If so, it sets `cur` to the second smallest such number.

6. **Output:**
   - The final value of `cur` is printed as the MEX of `c`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The program does not explicitly handle the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob. It assumes that simply finding the MEX of the entire array `a` will give the correct answer, which is not necessarily true due to the turns and the objective of both players.

2. **Handling of Counts:**
   - The logic for handling counts and determining the MEX after each turn is not correctly implemented. For example, the part where `cur` is set to the second smallest number with a count of 1 is not a correct strategy for the game.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program might not handle edge cases correctly, such as when all elements are the same or when the array contains only zeros.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players and might not handle all edge cases correctly.

**Correctness: False**
