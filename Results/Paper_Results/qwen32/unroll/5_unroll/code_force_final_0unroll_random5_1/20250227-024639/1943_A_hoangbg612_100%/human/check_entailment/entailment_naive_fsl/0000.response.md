Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players and does not accurately determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

### Issues in the Code

1. **Sorting the Array**: The code sorts the array `N` which is not necessary and does not help in determining the optimal moves for Alice and Bob.
2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The code attempts to calculate the MEX of `c` but does so incorrectly. It does not correctly simulate the game where Alice tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it.
3. **Handling of Frequencies**: The code uses a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each number in `N`. However, it does not use this correctly to simulate the game.
4. **Logic for Determining the MEX**: The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. It does not correctly handle the scenario where Alice and Bob make optimal moves.

### Correct Approach

The correct approach involves simulating the game where Alice and Bob make optimal moves. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of the optimal strategy:

- **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should always try to add a number to `c` that will maximize the MEX. This means she should add the smallest number that is not already in `c` and has an odd count in `N`.
- **Bob's Strategy**: Bob should try to minimize the MEX. This means he should remove numbers that would prevent Alice from maximizing the MEX.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails

Consider the following test case:

```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```

The correct output should be `1` because:
- Alice can choose `0` first, making `c = [0]` and `a = [1, 2, 3]`.
- Bob can choose `1`, making `a = [2, 3]`.
- Alice can choose `2`, making `c = [0, 2]` and `a = [3]`.
- Bob can choose `3`, making `a = []`.

The final `c` is `[0, 2]`, and the MEX is `1`.

However, the provided code will output `2` for this case, which is incorrect.

### Correct Implementation

Here is a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        from collections import Counter
        count = Counter(N)
        mex = 0
        while count[mex] > 0:
            mex += 1
        print(mex)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This code correctly counts the occurrences of each number and determines the MEX by finding the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array `N`.

Since the provided code does not handle the game logic correctly and does not produce the correct MEX for all cases, the correctness is `False`.
