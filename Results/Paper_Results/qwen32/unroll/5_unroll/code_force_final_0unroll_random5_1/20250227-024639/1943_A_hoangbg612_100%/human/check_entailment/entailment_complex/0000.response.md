Let's carefully analyze the provided program to see if it correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob to play the game and determine the final score based on the MEX of the array `c`.

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to `c`.
2. Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
3. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
4. The program should handle multiple test cases efficiently.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the size of the array) and the array `a` itself.
   
2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `a` is sorted. This is a step that seems logical for analyzing the sequence of elements, but it may not be necessary for finding the optimal MEX directly.

3. **Counting Frequencies:**
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count the frequency of each number in the sorted array `N`.
   
4. **Determining the MEX:**
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to `-1`.
   - The program iterates through the sorted array to find the smallest number that is not present in the array, incrementing `cur` accordingly.
   - If the sum of unique elements equals `n`, it increments `cur` by 1. This step seems to handle the case where all elements from `0` to `n-1` appear at least once.
   - It then checks if there are at least two elements with a frequency of `1` in the dictionary `M`. If so, it sets `cur` to the second smallest such element. This part of the logic seems flawed and does not align with the optimal strategy for determining the MEX.

### Flaws in the Program:
- The logic for determining the MEX seems overly complicated and incorrect. Specifically, the part where it checks for elements with a frequency of `1` and sets `cur` to the second smallest such element does not align with the optimal strategy.
- The sorting step is unnecessary for determining the MEX directly. The MEX can be calculated by counting the presence of each integer from `0` to `n-1` and finding the smallest integer that is not present.

### Correct Approach:
- Count the frequency of each integer from `0` to `n-1`.
- Determine the smallest integer that is not present in the array.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for determining the MEX of the array `c`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
