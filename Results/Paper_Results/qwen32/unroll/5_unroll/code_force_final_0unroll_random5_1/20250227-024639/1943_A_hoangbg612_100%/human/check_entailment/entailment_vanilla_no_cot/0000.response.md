Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob to determine the MEX of the final array `c` after the game. Here are some reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Sorting the array `N`**: The program sorts the array `N`. However, the order in which elements are chosen by Alice and Bob does not need to follow the sorted order to achieve the optimal MEX. The optimal strategy involves considering the frequency of each element and the turns of the players, not the sorted order.

2. **Logic for determining `cur`**: The logic to determine `cur` (the MEX) seems flawed. It tries to find the smallest missing number in a way that doesn't account for the turns of Alice and Bob correctly. The program should consider the parity of the number of occurrences of each number and the players' turns to decide which numbers Alice should pick to maximize the MEX.

3. **Handling of `cnt`**: The program constructs a list `cnt` of numbers that appear exactly once in `N`. It then checks if the length of `cnt` is at least 2 and sets `cur` to `cnt[1]`. This logic does not align with the optimal strategy for determining the MEX.

4. **Final condition check**: The program checks if the sum of the values in the dictionary `M` equals `S` (the size of the array `N`). This check is not necessary for determining the MEX optimally.

Here is a more correct approach to solve the problem:

1. Count the frequency of each number in the array `N`.
2. Determine the smallest number `i` such that the frequency of `i` is less than 2. This is because Alice can pick one instance of each number that appears exactly once to maximize the MEX.
3. Alice should aim to pick numbers in such a way that she can force Bob to pick numbers that do not affect the MEX calculation optimally.
4. The final MEX can be determined by considering the parity of the number of occurrences and the players' turns.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        freq = [0] * S
        for num in N:
            if num < S:
                freq[num] += 1
        mex = 0
        for i in range(S):
            if freq[i] < 2:
                mex = i
                break
        print(mex)

func()
```

This corrected version counts the frequency of each number, then determines the smallest number `i` that appears less than twice, which is the MEX of the final array `c` after both players play optimally.
