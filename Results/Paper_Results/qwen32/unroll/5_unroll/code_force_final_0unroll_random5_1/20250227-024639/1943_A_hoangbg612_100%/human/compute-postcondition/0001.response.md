The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `T`. The loop will execute if `T` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable that is used to iterate `T` times, and it doesn't need to be adjusted manually before the loop starts. The value of `t` and the details of each test case (consisting of `n` and the list `a`) are not directly relevant to whether the loop can execute; they are details that will be handled inside the loop.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `T` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`T` is an integer read from input and must be greater than or equal to 1**
