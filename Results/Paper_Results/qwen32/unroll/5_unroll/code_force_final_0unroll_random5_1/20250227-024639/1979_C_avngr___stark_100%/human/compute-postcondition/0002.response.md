To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `func_1`. Since `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, I'll assume a common operation that might be applied in such a context, such as multiplication, which is a reasonable guess given that the initial `result` is set to `numbers[0]` and the loop iterates over the rest of the list.

Assuming `func_1(a, b)` performs multiplication, i.e., `func_1(a, b) = a * b`, the loop will multiply all the elements in the list `numbers` together, starting with the first element.

Let's walk through the process:

1. Initial State: `result` is set to `numbers[0]`.
2. Loop Iteration: For each `num` in `numbers[1:]`, `result` is updated to `result * num`.

After the loop finishes, `result` will be the product of all the integers in the list `numbers`.

Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose `numbers = [3, 4, 5]`:
- Initial State: `result = 3`
- Iteration 1: `result = 3 * 4 = 12`
- Iteration 2: `result = 12 * 5 = 60`

Thus, the final `result` would be `60`.

Output State: **result is the product of all integers in the list numbers.**
