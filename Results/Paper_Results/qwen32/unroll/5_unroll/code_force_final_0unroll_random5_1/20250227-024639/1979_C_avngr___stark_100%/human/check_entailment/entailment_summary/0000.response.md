Reasoning:
The provided program aims to solve the given problem by distributing the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Let's break down the program and the functions:

1. The main part of the program reads the input, which includes the number of test cases and for each test case, the number of outcomes and their respective multipliers.
2. For each test case, it calls `func_2` to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers. This is done to find a common base for the bets such that the condition of receiving more coins than the total bet is satisfied for each outcome.
3. It then calculates the bets by dividing the LCM by each multiplier. This ensures that the bet on each outcome is proportional to the inverse of its multiplier.
4. The program checks if the total sum of the bets is less than the LCM. If it is, the bets are printed; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

However, there is a mistake in the implementation of `func_2`. The function is named `func_2` but its description and code suggest that it should calculate the LCM of the list of numbers. But `func_2` actually calculates the product of the numbers, not the LCM. The LCM of a list of numbers is not the product of those numbers; it is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the numbers in the list.

The correct implementation of `func_2` should use the `func_1` function to calculate the LCM iteratively. The correct code for `func_2` should be:

```python
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
    return result
```

And `func_1` correctly calculates the LCM of two numbers:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
```

Given the current implementation of `func_2`, it calculates the product of the multipliers, which is not the LCM. This can lead to incorrect results because the bets will not necessarily satisfy the condition of receiving more coins than the total bet for each outcome.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect implementation of the LCM calculation.

Correctness: **False**
