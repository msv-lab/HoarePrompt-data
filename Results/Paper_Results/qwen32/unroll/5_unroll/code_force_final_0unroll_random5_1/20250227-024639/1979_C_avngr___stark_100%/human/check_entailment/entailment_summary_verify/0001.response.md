### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the provided code. The code includes functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) that compute the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of integers, but these functions do not directly address the problem of distributing the bets to ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The problem requires finding a distribution of bets such that for each outcome `i`, the bet `x_i` satisfies `k_i * x_i > total_bet`, where `total_bet` is the sum of all bets. The provided code does not implement this logic. Instead, it focuses on computing the LCM, which is not relevant to solving the problem as described.

The original assessment suggests a correct approach:
1. Start by setting all bets to 1.
2. Check if the total bet is less than the amount received for each winning outcome.
3. If not, incrementally increase the bets until the condition is satisfied.

This approach ensures that the bets meet the required constraints. The provided code does not implement this logic, making it incorrect for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation
