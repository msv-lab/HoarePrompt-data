To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether the program correctly solves the problem described. The program is supposed to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: number of test cases
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: number of outcomes
     - `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`: multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output `-1` if no valid distribution exists.
   - Otherwise, output `n` integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` representing the bets on the outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is less than the amount received for each winning outcome.

### Program Analysis
The provided code includes two functions:
- `func_1(a, b)`: Computes the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
- `func_2(numbers)`: Computes the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.

However, the provided code does not directly address the problem of distributing the bets. It calculates the LCM of the multipliers, which does not inherently help in determining the bets `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` that satisfy the problem constraints.

### Solution Approach
To solve the problem, we need to find a way to distribute the bets such that the total bet is less than the amount received for each winning outcome. One way to do this is to:
1. Calculate the total bet as the sum of `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n`.
2. Ensure that for each `i`, `k_i * x_i > total_bet`.

A simple approach is to set `x_i = 1` for all `i` and check if the condition holds. If not, we can incrementally increase the bets to ensure the condition is met.

### Correct Implementation Example
Here is a simple implementation that addresses the problem:

```python
def solve(n, k):
    # Try setting all bets to 1 initially
    bets = [1] * n
    total_bet = sum(bets)
    
    # Check if the initial bets satisfy the condition
    valid = True
    for i in range(n):
        if k[i] * bets[i] <= total_bet:
            valid = False
            break
    
    if valid:
        return bets
    
    # If not, incrementally increase the bets
    for i in range(n):
        while k[i] * bets[i] <= total_bet:
            bets[i] += 1
            total_bet = sum(bets)
    
    return bets

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        k = list(map(int, input[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        bets = solve(n, k)
        if bets == -1:
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, bets)))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it does not implement the logic to determine the bets `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` that satisfy the problem constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
