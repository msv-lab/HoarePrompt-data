Correctness: **False**

The provided program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but it does not contain any logic to solve the problem described. The functions seem to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers, but this is not directly related to the problem of distributing the bets on the outcomes.

To solve the problem, we need to find a way to distribute the bets such that the total amount bet is less than the amount received for any winning outcome. A straightforward solution is to bet 1 coin on the first outcome and 0 coins on the rest. This guarantees that for any winning outcome, the amount received will be at least twice the total amount bet (since the minimum multiplier is 2).

Here is a possible correct implementation of the solution:

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        k = list(map(int, input[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        if n == 1:
            results.append("1")
        else:
            results.append("1 " + " ".join("0" * (n - 1)))
    print("\n".join(results))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```

This implementation reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the bets as described. For each test case, it bets 1 coin on the first outcome and 0 coins on the rest, ensuring that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
