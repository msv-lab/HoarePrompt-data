To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem statement and the solution step by step:

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
   - There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
   - For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

2. **Constraints**:
   - `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`
   - `1 ≤ k ≤ n`
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `10^7`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - We need to ensure that the sum `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence of `a`.
   - For all other sums `v` (where `v ≠ k`), a subsequence should exist that sums to `v`.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided program generates the sequence as follows:
1. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes `nums` with the first 24 powers of 2 (`1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^23`). This is because the sum of the first `m` powers of 2 is `2^(m+1) - 1`, which means the first 24 powers of 2 can sum up to any number up to `2^24 - 1` (which is much larger than `n`).

2. **Adjusting for `k`**:
   - It finds the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - It then removes this power of 2 from `nums` and adds three new numbers:
     - `k - nums[idx]`
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`

3. **Output**:
   - It prints the length of `nums` and the elements of `nums`.

### Verification:
Let's verify if the solution meets the problem requirements:
1. **Sum of `k`**:
   - By removing a specific power of 2 and adding the new numbers, the sum `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence of `nums`. This is because the new numbers are carefully chosen to avoid forming `k`.

2. **Sum of `v` (where `v ≠ k`)**:
   - The original sequence of powers of 2 can form any sum up to `2^24 - 1`. By replacing a specific power of 2 and adding the new numbers, the sequence can still form most sums, except for `k`.
   - The new numbers added ensure that the sequence can form the sums around `k` without forming `k` itself.

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to correctly generate a sequence `a` that meets the problem requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums up to `n` (except `k`).

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
