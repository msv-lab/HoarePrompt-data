You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
        
        idx = 0
        
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        
        idx -= 1
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k`, and outputs the length of a modified list of numbers and the numbers themselves. The list is initially composed of powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\), modified by removing a specific power of 2 and adding three new numbers based on the value of `k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not guarantee that there is no subsequence of the sequence `a` with a sum of `k`, and it doesn't ensure that for all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`. Let's analyze why:

1. **Generating the Sequence:**
   - The program generates a sequence of numbers using powers of 2 (`nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]`).
   - It then tries to adjust this sequence to avoid a subsequence that sums to `k` and ensure all sums from `1` to `n` (except `k`) are possible.

2. **Adjustments:**
   - The program finds the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and removes it from the sequence.
   - It then appends `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the sequence.

3. **Issues:**
   - **Avoiding Subsequence Sum of `k`:** The adjustments made to the sequence do not guarantee that no subsequence sums to `k`. For example, if `k` is a sum of multiple elements in the original sequence, the removal of `nums[idx]` and addition of new elements might still allow a subsequence to sum to `k`.
   - **Ensuring All Sums from `1` to `n` (except `k`):** The adjustments also do not guarantee that all sums from `1` to `n` (except `k`) are possible. The new elements added might not cover all necessary sums.

4. **Example Case:**
   - Consider `n = 10` and `k = 7`.
   - The original sequence `nums` will be `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`.
   - The highest power of 2 less than or equal to `7` is `4` (i.e., `nums[2]`).
   - After removing `4` and adding `7 - 4 = 3`, `7 + 1 = 8`, and `7 + 4 + 1 = 12`, the new sequence is `[1, 2, 8, 12, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`.
   - However, this sequence does not guarantee that all sums from `1` to `10` (except `7`) are possible. For example, it is not possible to form the sum `6` with the new sequence.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
