Reasoning:

The provided code is intended to solve the problem described, but there are several issues and inconsistencies that need to be addressed to ensure its correctness:

1. **Function `func_3`**: The function `func_3` is supposed to calculate the initial sum of the best possible profit Alice can make. However, the function always returns a fixed value (94), which is incorrect. The function should correctly compute the sum based on the logic of the problem.

2. **Logic for calculating the profit**: The algorithm attempts to maximize Alice's profit by sorting the items based on Bob's price and then using a max-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the items that Alice should buy. However, the logic for updating the `sub_sum` and `max_value` seems flawed. Specifically, the way `sub_sum` is updated and the conditions under which `max_value` is updated do not align with the optimal strategy described in the problem.

3. **Handling edge cases**: The code does not explicitly handle cases where `k` is 0 or `k` is equal to `n`. In these cases, the logic should be simplified since either Bob gets all items for free or Bob gets exactly `k` items for free, and the rest are bought by Bob.

4. **Correctness of the sorting and heap usage**: The items are sorted based on Bob's price (`b_i`), but the logic for maintaining the heap and updating the `sub_sum` needs to be carefully verified to ensure that it correctly reflects the optimal strategy.

Given these points, the current implementation is not correct. The function `func_3` returning a fixed value is a significant issue, and the overall logic for calculating the profit needs to be re-evaluated.

Correctness: **False**
