### Reasoning:

The provided code and its annotated version show several issues that indicate the program is not correctly implementing the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The code uses `putin()` which is not defined in the provided code. It should use `sys.stdin.readline()` directly for reading input.

2. **Sorting Logic**:
   - The code sorts the items based on `b_i` in ascending order (`arr.sort(key=lambda y: y[1], reverse=False)`). This is incorrect because Alice should prioritize items with the highest `b_i - a_i` value to maximize her profit.

3. **Heap Usage**:
   - The code uses a heap to manage the `k` items Bob will take for free. However, the logic is flawed. The heap is supposed to keep track of the `k` items with the highest `b_i - a_i` values, but the current implementation does not ensure this.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The `func_3` function calculates the profit incorrectly. It sums the `a_i` values of `sec_arr` and adds the sum of `a_i + b_i` for items in `main_ar` where `a_i + b_i >= 0`. This does not account for Bob's strategy of taking `k` items for free.

5. **Overall Strategy**:
   - The code does not correctly implement the strategy where Alice buys items with the highest `b_i - a_i` values and Bob takes the `k` items with the highest `b_i - a_i` values for free.

### Correct Implementation:

Here is a correct implementation of the problem:

```python
import sys
import heapq

def main():
    import sys
    import heapq
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        
        b = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        
        items = [(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
        items.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] - x[0], reverse=True)
        
        alice_profit = 0
        bob_free_items = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i < k:
                heapq.heappush(bob_free_items, items[i][0])
            else:
                alice_profit += items[i][1]
                alice_profit -= items[i][0]
                if items[i][0] < bob_free_items[0]:
                    alice_profit += heapq.heappop(bob_free_items)
                    heapq.heappush(bob_free_items, items[i][0])
        
        results.append(alice_profit)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
