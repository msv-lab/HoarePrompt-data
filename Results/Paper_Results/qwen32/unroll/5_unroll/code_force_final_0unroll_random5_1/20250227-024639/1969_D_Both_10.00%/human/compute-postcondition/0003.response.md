To determine the state that ensures the for loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for val_b in main_ar:`. Therefore, the only variable we can adjust is `val_b`, and the list `main_ar` itself.

For the loop to execute, `main_ar` must contain at least one element. The variable `val_b` will take on the value of the first element in `main_ar` during the first iteration of the loop.

The state of `sub_summ` and `sec_arr` is not relevant to whether the loop can execute, so we do not need to adjust them.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers**.
