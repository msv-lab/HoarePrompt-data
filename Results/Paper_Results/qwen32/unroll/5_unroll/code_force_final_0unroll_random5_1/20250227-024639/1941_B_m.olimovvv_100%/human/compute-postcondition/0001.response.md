To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand how the given code processes each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case:
   - `a` is the number of integers in the list `b`.
   - `b` is a list of `a` integers.

2. **Inner Loop**: For each test case, the inner loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = a - 3` (inclusive). This loop modifies the elements of the list `b` as follows:
   - If `b[i]` is less than 0, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it subtracts `b[i] * 2` from `b[i + 1]` and `b[i]` from `b[i + 2]`, and sets `b[i]` to 0.
   
3. **Post Inner Loop**: If the inner loop completes without breaking (i.e., all `b[i]` values are non-negative), the code checks the last two elements of `b`:
   - If either `b[-1]` or `b[-2]` is not 0, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The output of each test case is either 'YES' or 'NO', which is printed to the console. The state of the list `b` and the variable `a` are modified during the execution of the inner loop, but they do not affect the subsequent test cases because `a` and `b` are re-initialized for each test case.

Given the format, the output state can be described as the sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' printed for each test case. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact sequence of outputs. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the results of the test cases.

Output State: **A sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' corresponding to the results of each test case.**
