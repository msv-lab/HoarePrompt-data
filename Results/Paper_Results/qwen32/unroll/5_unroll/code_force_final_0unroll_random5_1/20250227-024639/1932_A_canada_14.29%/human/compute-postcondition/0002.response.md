The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases (with the constraint 1 <= t <= 1000), and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) and a string `path` of length `n`. The string `path` consists of characters '.', '@', or '*', with the first character guaranteed to be '.'. 

The function processes each test case independently. For each test case, the function returns an output based on the characters in the `path` string.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a string `path` of length `n` consisting of '.', '@', or '*' characters, with the first character being '.'.
