### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary in detail to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis

The objective is to find the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` for one yogurt and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts.

#### Program Analysis

Here's the provided program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Misinterpretation of Input Variables**:
   - The program reads `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. However, `c` is not used correctly. According to the problem description, the input should be `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts.
   - The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`. This calculation is incorrect because `c` is not defined in the problem description. It seems like an attempt to calculate the average price per yogurt, but this is not relevant to the problem's logic.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The condition `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect. Here, `a * b` means the cost of buying `b` yogurts individually, which is not the intended logic. The condition should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts individually with the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotion.
   - The `else` block `print(round(a * d))` is also incorrect. It seems to be attempting to print the cost of buying `d` yogurts individually, which is not the intended logic.

#### Correct Implementation

Here is a correct implementation of the solution:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Cost if all yogurts are bought individually
        cost_individual = n * a
        # Cost if all yogurts are bought in pairs (with possible leftovers)
        number_of_pairs = n // 2
        number_of_leftovers = n % 2
        cost_pairs = number_of_pairs * b + number_of_leftovers * a
        # Minimum cost
        print(min(cost_individual, cost_pairs))

# Call the function to execute
func()
```

#### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect due to the misinterpretation of input variables and incorrect logic.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
