To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the provided loop:

The loop iterates over the string `inpstr` (which is the same as `s` in the initial state). It looks for the first occurrence of the character 'B'. As soon as it finds 'B', it updates `ind1` to the index of that 'B' and breaks out of the loop. The variables `ind2` and `outind` remain unchanged throughout the loop, and `t` and `n` are not affected by the loop.

Given that `s` contains at least one 'B', the loop will always find a 'B' and update `ind1` accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in `s`; `inpstr` is assigned the value of the input string; `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `s`; `ind2` is 0; `outind` is 0.**
