Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is 9; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string; `k` is an input integer; `x` is 9; `y` is 8; `c` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; `d` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; if `c` is equal to `d`, then `b` has an additional element `1` appended to its previous contents. Otherwise, `b` has an additional element `0` appended to it.**
