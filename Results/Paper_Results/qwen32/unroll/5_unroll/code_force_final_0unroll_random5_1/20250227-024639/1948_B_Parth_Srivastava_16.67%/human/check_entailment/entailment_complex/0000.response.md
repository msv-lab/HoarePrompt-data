### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the logic it follows to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The program consists of a main loop that processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_1()` which performs the following steps:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - Reads the number of elements `k` in the array.
   - Reads the array `a` of `k` integers.

2. **Transformation Logic:**
   - Iterates through the array `a`.
   - For each element `a[i]`:
     - If `a[i]` is greater than 10:
       - Splits `a[i]` into its digits `x` (units place) and `y` (tens place).
       - Checks whether the digits can be inserted in a way that maintains the non-decreasing order.
       - If `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of the current list `c` and `y` is less than or equal to `x`, it inserts `y` and `x` into `c`.
       - Otherwise, it inserts the original number `a[i]` into `c`.
     - If `a[i]` is not greater than 10, it simply inserts the number into `c`.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After processing all elements, it checks if the list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints "YES" for each test case where `b[i]` is `1` and "NO" where `b[i]` is `0`.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
The transformation logic in `func_1()` is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for inserting the digits are not correctly handling all cases where the array can be sorted by splitting elements. Here are some key issues:

- **Incorrect Handling of Insertion Conditions:**
  - The program does not correctly handle cases where splitting a number does not disrupt the order.
  - The condition `if y >= c[n - 1]` is too restrictive. It should consider the entire context of the array to determine if the split is valid.
  
- **Lack of Full Array Context:**
  - The program only checks the immediate previous element `c[n - 1]` to decide if the digits should be inserted. This is insufficient because the split might be valid only if the digits fit in the overall sorted order of the array.

### Example:
Consider the input `[12, 28, 5]`:

- For `12`, it splits into `1` and `2`. However, the program might incorrectly decide to keep `12` based on the condition.
- For `28`, it splits into `2` and `8`. Again, the decision might be incorrect based on the immediate previous element.
- For `5`, it remains `5`.

The program might output "NO" for this case because it does not fully consider the overall sorted order after each split.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting elements. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
