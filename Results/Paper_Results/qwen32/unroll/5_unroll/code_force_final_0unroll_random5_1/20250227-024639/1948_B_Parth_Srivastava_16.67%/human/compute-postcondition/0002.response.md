The code snippet converts the string `a` into a list of integers. Therefore, `a` will no longer be a string but a list of integers after the execution.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string; `k` is an input integer.**
