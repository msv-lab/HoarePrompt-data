The value of `n` is set to 0, which overrides its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; For each test case, `n` is 0, and `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string; `k` is an input integer; `x` is 0; `y` is 0.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is 0; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string; `k` is an input integer; `x` is 0; `y` is 0.**
