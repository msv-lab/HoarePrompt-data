You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a list of integers derived from the input, rearranges certain elements based on specific conditions, and appends either `1` or `0` to a list `b` depending on whether the rearranged list is sorted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`m`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`k`) and the array itself.
   - The array is converted into a list of integers.

2. **Splitting Logic:**
   - The program iterates over the array elements.
   - When it encounters a number greater than 10, it attempts to split it into two digits.
   - It then checks if the resulting digits can be inserted into the new array `c` while maintaining a non-decreasing order.
   - The logic for splitting and inserting is flawed. It does not correctly handle the insertion of digits in a way that ensures the array remains sorted.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After processing the array, the program checks if the modified array `c` is sorted.
   - If it is sorted, it appends `1` to the results list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`.

### Flaws in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Splitting and Insertion Logic:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the insertion of digits. For example, if a number like `28` is encountered, the program might incorrectly decide to keep `28` instead of splitting it into `2` and `8`.
   - The logic for comparing digits and deciding whether to split and insert them is flawed.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where multiple splits are needed or where the initial array is already sorted.

3. **General Correctness:**
   - The program does not guarantee that the array can be sorted by correctly applying the operation. It may incorrectly conclude that an array cannot be sorted when it actually can.

### Conclusion:
Given the flawed logic for splitting and inserting digits, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the allowed operations.

**Correctness:** **False**
