### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program given the problem description and the annotated version of the code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits.
- The operations can be performed any number of times (including zero times).

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `a`.
- It then processes the list `a` to check if it can be sorted by splitting elements greater than 10.
- The logic within `func_1` is designed to handle the splitting and checking process.

#### Annotations and Code Flow:
- The annotations indicate that the program is supposed to handle the splitting of numbers and checking if the resulting array can be sorted.
- However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed:
  - It only checks if the current number can be split and inserted in a sorted manner relative to the previous number.
  - It does not consider all possible ways to split numbers and check if the final array can be sorted.
  - Specifically, the logic for inserting digits and checking the overall sorted order is incorrect.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
  ```
  1
  3
  9 11 10
  ```
- The expected output is `YES` because the array can be transformed into a sorted array `[0, 1, 1, 1, 9]` by splitting `11` and `10`.
- However, the program outputs `NO` because it does not correctly handle the logic for splitting and checking the final sorted order.

#### Code Issues:
1. **Splitting Logic**: The code does not correctly handle the insertion of digits from numbers greater than 10.
2. **Checking Sorted Order**: The code does not check if the final array can be sorted after all possible splits.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. The logic for splitting numbers and checking if the resulting array can be sorted is flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
