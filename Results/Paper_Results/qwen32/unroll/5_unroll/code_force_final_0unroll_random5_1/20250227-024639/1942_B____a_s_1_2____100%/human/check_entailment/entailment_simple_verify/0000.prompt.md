You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Given an array `a` of length `n`, construct a permutation `p` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.
- There is at least one valid `p` for the given `a`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to construct the permutation `p` by iterating from the end of the array `a` to the beginning. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Length of the array `a`.
     - `a`: The input array.
     - `p`: An array initialized with `-1` of length `n`.
     - `mex`: Initialized to `n`.

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - Iterate from the end of `a` to the beginning (`for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1)`).
   - For each index `i`, compute `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - Update `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - Print the constructed permutation `p`.

### Potential Issues:
The main issue with the provided program is that it does not correctly compute the `MEX` at each step. The `MEX` should be computed based on the elements already placed in `p` up to the current index, not just using a single `mex` variable that is updated in a backward manner.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```
The program will output:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```
This output is correct, but let's consider another case:
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
The program will output:
```
5 -1 -2 -3 -4
```
This output is incorrect because `p` should be a permutation of numbers from `0` to `4`, and the output contains negative numbers and numbers greater than `4`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly compute the permutation `p`, we need to maintain a set of available numbers (initially all numbers from `0` to `n-1`) and update it as we construct `p`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        available = set(range(n))
        
        for i in range(n):
            mex = min(available)
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            available.remove(mex)
        
        print(*p)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle the computation of `MEX` and constructing the permutation `p`. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The original program incorrectly computes the `MEX` by using a single variable `mex` that is not dynamically updated based on the elements already placed in `p`. This leads to incorrect results, especially when the input array `a` contains values that require a correct dynamic computation of `MEX`.
