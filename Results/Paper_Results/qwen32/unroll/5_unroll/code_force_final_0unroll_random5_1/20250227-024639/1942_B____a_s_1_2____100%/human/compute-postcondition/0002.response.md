To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand what the loop does in each iteration. The loop processes each test case by reading an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then constructs a permutation `p` based on the values in `a` and a variable `mex` (minimum excluded value), which starts at `n`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's logic in a single iteration:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`.
   - `p` is initialized to a list of `-1` of length `n`.

2. **Loop through `a` in reverse**:
   - For each element `a[i]` in `a` starting from the last element to the first:
     - `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]`.
     - `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation `p` is printed.

After all test cases have been processed, the state of the variables `t`, `n`, and `a` will be as they were in the last test case processed, because these variables are overwritten in each iteration. The variable `p` will hold the permutation from the last test case, and `mex` will hold the final value of `mex` from the last test case.

The final state of the variables that are not affected by the loop head and body (like `t`, `n`, and `a` from the last iteration) will remain as they were at the end of the last iteration.

**Output State**: **`t` is the number of test cases processed, `n` is the length of the last test case's list `a`, `a` is the list of integers from the last test case, `p` is the permutation constructed for the last test case, and `mex` is the minimum excluded value from the last test case.**

However, since the question asks for the output state in terms of the values of the variables that are changed in the loop, and given that `p` and `mex` are the only variables that are modified within the loop, the final state we need to describe is:

Output State: **`p` is the permutation constructed for the last test case, and `mex` is the minimum excluded value from the last test case.**
