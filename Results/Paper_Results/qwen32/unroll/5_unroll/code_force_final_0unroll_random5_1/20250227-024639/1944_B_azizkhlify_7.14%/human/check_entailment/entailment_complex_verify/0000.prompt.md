You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: A sequence of integers printed based on the conditions described in the code.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an integer `k`, along with an array `a` of length `2n` containing each integer from 1 to `n` exactly twice. For each test case, it prints a sequence of integers based on specific conditions related to the counts of elements in the first and second halves of the array. The function ensures that exactly `k` pairs or single elements are printed from the first half, and then prints the remaining elements to balance the counts from the second half if necessary.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not always correctly find two subsets `l` and `r` of length `2k` such that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`. Let's examine why:

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incomplete Handling of XOR Equality**:
   - The code attempts to build the subsets `l` and `r` by first adding pairs of identical elements from the first and second halves of the array. However, it does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`. It only ensures that some elements are added based on the count of occurrences, which does not guarantee the XOR condition.

2. **Potential Misalignment of XOR Values**:
   - The code does not handle the XOR condition properly. It prints a pair of identical elements from the first half and the second half, but it does not ensure that the remaining elements selected (if any) will result in the same XOR value.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Handling Remaining Elements**:
   - After adding pairs of identical elements, the code attempts to add single elements from the first half to `l` and prints them in `r`. However, this does not ensure that the XOR of `l` and `r` will be equal.

4. **Potential Infinite Loop or Incorrect Termination**:
   - The code uses `ul` and `ur` to track the number of elements added to `l` and `r`, respectively. However, the logic for ensuring `ul == ur` is incorrect and may not terminate as expected.

### Example Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

The program might output:
```
1 2 1 2
1 2
```

Here, `l = [1, 2, 1, 2]` and `r = [1, 2]`. The bitwise XOR of `l` is `1 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 2 = 0`, and the bitwise XOR of `r` is `1 ^ 2 = 3`. Clearly, `0 != 3`, so the XOR condition is not satisfied.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve ensuring that the XOR of the selected elements in `l` and `r` is equal. This can be done by a more systematic selection of elements, possibly using a greedy or backtracking approach to ensure the XOR condition is met.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases and fails to ensure that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
