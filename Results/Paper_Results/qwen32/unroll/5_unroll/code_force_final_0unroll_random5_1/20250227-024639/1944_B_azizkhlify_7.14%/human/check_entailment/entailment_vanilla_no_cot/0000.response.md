Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Here are the issues with the code:

1. The program initializes `l` and `r` as arrays of length `n`, but it should be used as counters for the occurrences of each number in the first and second halves of the array `a`, respectively. The initialization of `l` and `r` should be dictionaries or arrays of length `n+1` because the numbers in `a` range from 1 to `n`.

2. The logic for selecting elements for `l` and `r` is flawed. The program tries to print elements directly without properly forming the `l` and `r` arrays or ensuring their XOR values are equal.

3. The program does not handle the XOR condition correctly. It simply prints elements without ensuring that the XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of the elements in `r`.

4. The program does not correctly manage the case where the XOR values of the elements in `l` and `r` need to be equal. It does not handle cases where additional elements need to be added to `r` to match the XOR value of `l`.

A correct solution would involve creating the `l` and `r` arrays by selecting elements from the first and second halves of `a` respectively, while ensuring that the XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of the elements in `r`. This can be done by carefully selecting pairs of elements or single elements to match the XOR values.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        left_half = a[:n]
        right_half = a[n:]
        
        from collections import Counter
        left_count = Counter(left_half)
        right_count = Counter(right_half)
        
        l = []
        r = []
        
        # First, try to add pairs of identical elements to l and r
        for num in range(1, n + 1):
            if left_count[num] == 2:
                l.extend([num, num])
                left_count[num] = 0
            if right_count[num] == 2:
                r.extend([num, num])
                right_count[num] = 0
            if len(l) == 2 * k and len(r) == 2 * k:
                break
        
        # If we don't have enough elements in l or r, add single elements
        if len(l) < 2 * k:
            for num in range(1, n + 1):
                if left_count[num] == 1:
                    l.append(num)
                    left_count[num] = 0
                if len(l) == 2 * k:
                    break
        if len(r) < 2 * k:
            for num in range(1, n + 1):
                if right_count[num] == 1:
                    r.append(num)
                    right_count[num] = 0
                if len(r) == 2 * k:
                    break
        
        # Ensure the XOR values of l and r are equal
        xor_l = 0
        for num in l:
            xor_l ^= num
        
        xor_r = 0
        for num in r:
            xor_r ^= num
        
        if xor_l != xor_r:
            # Find an element to swap to balance the XOR values
            for num in range(1, n + 1):
                if num in left_count and num in right_count and left_count[num] == 1 and right_count[num] == 1:
                    l.append(num)
                    r.append(num)
                    break
        
        print(' '.join(map(str, l)))
        print(' '.join(map(str, r)))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the XOR values of `l` and `r` are equal by carefully selecting elements from the left and right halves of the array.
