The code snippet provided updates the variable `arr` by assigning it the return value of the function `func_2()`. This means the original list `arr` is replaced with whatever list is returned by `func_2()`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the return values of `func_1()`, `arr` is the return value of `func_2()`, `pos` is an integer representing the position of `k` in `arr`, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search boundaries in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to keep track of the midpoints visited during the binary search.**
