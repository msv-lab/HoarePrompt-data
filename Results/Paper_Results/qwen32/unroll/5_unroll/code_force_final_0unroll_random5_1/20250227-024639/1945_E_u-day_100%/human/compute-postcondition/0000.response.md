The code snippet `n, k = func_1()` assigns the return values of `func_1()` to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state mentions that `n` and `k` are already defined, but their values are updated to whatever `func_1()` returns. The other variables (`arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the return values of `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of length `n`, `pos` is an integer representing the position of `k` in `arr`, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search boundaries in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to keep track of the midpoints visited during the binary search.**
