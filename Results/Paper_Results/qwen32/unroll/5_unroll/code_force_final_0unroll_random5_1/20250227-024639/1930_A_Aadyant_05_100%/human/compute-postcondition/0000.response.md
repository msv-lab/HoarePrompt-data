The code snippet `n = input()` assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `n`. Since `input()` typically takes a string input from the user, `n` will be a string representation of the number entered. However, based on the context provided, it is expected that `n` should be an integer. Therefore, the output state should reflect that `n` is now a string, and we should note that it is expected to be converted to an integer for further use.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 <= int(n) <= 50; `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^7.**
