The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `len(num) - 1`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `num`. If `num` has at least one test case, the loop can execute because `len(num) - 1` will be a valid starting index for the loop.

For the loop to execute, `num` must contain at least one test case. The variable `i` is initialized to `len(num) - 1` before the loop starts, and it will decrement in each iteration until it reaches `-1`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`num` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `counter` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`**
