The function `count_zero` is not correctly defined according to the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def game_winner(t, test_cases):` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two elements: the first element is a tuple `(n, m)` where `n` is the number of integers in the list (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `m` is the parameter determining when Sasha wins (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6), and the second element is a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the list that Sasha gave to Anna. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
