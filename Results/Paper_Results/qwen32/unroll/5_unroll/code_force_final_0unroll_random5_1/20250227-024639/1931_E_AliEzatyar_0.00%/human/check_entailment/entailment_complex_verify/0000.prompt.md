You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Output

    Sasha
    Anna
    Anna
    Sasha
    Sasha
    Anna
    Anna
    Anna
    Sasha
    
Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing two integers n and m, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Specifically, 1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in the list. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: num is [[1, 1, [0]]]; counter is 1.
    return counter
    #The program returns 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of `n` integers. However, the function only examines the last element of the `num` list and counts the number of trailing '0' strings in reverse order until a non-'0' element is encountered. The function returns the count of these trailing '0' strings. Given the provided return postcondition, the function always returns 1, indicating that there is exactly one trailing '0' string in the last element of the `num` list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Function Name and Typo**: The program uses `func_1` which is not defined anywhere in the provided code. It seems this function is supposed to count the trailing zeros of a number, but it is not defined correctly.

2. **Typo in Output**: The output for Sasha is incorrectly written as `'Sashah'` instead of `'Sasha'`.

3. **Logic Errors**:
   - The program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. It does not implement Anna's turn of reversing digits and Sasha's turn of concatenating two numbers.
   - The logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program calculates the total number of digits and subtracts the count of trailing zeros from every second number in the sorted list of trailing zeros, but this does not accurately simulate the game or determine the final number's length.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle several edge cases:
   - When the list has only one number, the game ends immediately, and the winner should be determined based on whether this number is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).
   - When the list has two numbers, the winner should be determined based on the concatenation of these two numbers in either order.
   - The program does not handle cases where Anna can reverse a number to make it larger or smaller, affecting the final concatenated number.

5. **No Game Simulation**: The program does not simulate the turns of Anna and Sasha. It only performs some calculations on the digits of the numbers, which is not sufficient to determine the winner based on the game rules.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and will not provide the correct winner for all possible test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
