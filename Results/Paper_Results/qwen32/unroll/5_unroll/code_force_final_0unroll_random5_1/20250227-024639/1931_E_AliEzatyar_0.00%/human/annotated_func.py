#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing two integers n and m, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Specifically, 1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in the list. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: num is [[1, 1, [0]]]; counter is 1.
    return counter
    #The program returns 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of `n` integers. However, the function only examines the last element of the `num` list and counts the number of trailing '0' strings in reverse order until a non-'0' element is encountered. The function returns the count of these trailing '0' strings. Given the provided return postcondition, the function always returns 1, indicating that there is exactly one trailing '0' string in the last element of the `num` list.
