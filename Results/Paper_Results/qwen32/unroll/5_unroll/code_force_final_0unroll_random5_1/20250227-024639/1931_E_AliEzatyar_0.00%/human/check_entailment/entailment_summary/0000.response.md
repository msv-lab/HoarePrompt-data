### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the rules described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Functionality of `func_1`:** The function `func_1` is supposed to count the number of trailing zeros in a given number, but it doesn't correctly handle the input as described in the execution summary. The function is applied to each number in the list, but the execution summary suggests it only examines the last element of the input list. This is incorrect because it should be applied to each number in the list to count the trailing zeros for each.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner:** The main logic in the loop that determines the winner is flawed. The program calculates `total_digits` as the sum of the lengths of all numbers in the list, and `subtract_zero` as the sum of the trailing zeros of every other number in the sorted list of trailing zeros. The condition to determine the winner uses `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1`. However, this does not correctly simulate the game's rules:
    - Anna's move reverses the digits of a number, which could increase or decrease the total number of digits.
    - Sasha's move concatenates two numbers, which increases the total number of digits.
    - The condition `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` does not account for the actual game mechanics where Anna and Sasha take turns optimally.

3. **Typographical Error:** The program mistakenly prints `'Sashah'` instead of `'Sasha'` when Sasha wins.

### Conclusion:

Given the above issues, the provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules and logic described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
