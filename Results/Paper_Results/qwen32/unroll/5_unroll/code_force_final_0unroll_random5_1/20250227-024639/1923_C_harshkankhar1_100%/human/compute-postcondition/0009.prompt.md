You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5. The array c is a list of n integers where each element c_i is an integer such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers read from the input where 1 <= `n`, `q` <= 3 * 10^5; the array `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `c_i` <= 10^9; for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1:]` contains the integers from `c`; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of 1 and 2 based on the condition `a[j] > 1` for `j` from 1 to `i`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: The output state consists of `t` test cases, each with `n` integers in array `c`, `q` queries defined by pairs `(l_i, r_i)`, and the lists `a` and `b` computed as described. After executing the loop, the output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each query, based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of integers `n` and `q`, a list `c` of `n` integers, and `q` queries where each query is defined by integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, the function returns the sum of the elements in the list `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` inclusive. The function handles up to 10,000 test cases, with the total number of elements in all lists `c` and the total number of queries not exceeding 300,000.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
