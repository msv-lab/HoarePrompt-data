The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and then creates a new list `a` where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are the integers read from the input. 

Given the initial state, `c` is the list of `n` integers, and `a` is not yet defined. After executing the code, `a` will be a new list with `0` as the first element and the integers from `c` as the subsequent elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers read from the input where 1 <= `n`, `q` <= 3 * 10^5; the array `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `c_i` <= 10^9; for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1:]` contains the integers from `c`.**
