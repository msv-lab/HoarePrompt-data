### Reasoning:

The program's goal is to determine the maximum final score achievable by performing the described moves optimally. For each test case, it reads the number of integers (2n) and the list of integers, then calculates the sum of the minimum values of n pairs of integers chosen optimally.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of pairs) and then reads the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The integers are stored in a list `list1`.
   - `list1` is sorted.
   - The program then picks every second element from the sorted list starting from the first element (index 0). This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements are at the beginning. By picking every second element, we ensure we are adding the smallest possible values to the score, which is optimal.
   - These selected elements are added to `list2`.
   - The sum of `list2` is computed and stored in the `out` list.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sums stored in `out` for each test case.

The approach taken by the program is correct because sorting the list and then picking every second element ensures that we are always adding the smallest possible values to the score. This strategy guarantees the maximum possible score under the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy to solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
