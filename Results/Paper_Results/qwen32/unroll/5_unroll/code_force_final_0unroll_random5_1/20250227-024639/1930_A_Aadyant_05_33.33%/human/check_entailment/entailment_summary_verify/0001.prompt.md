You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        list1 = []
        a = input()
        a = int(a)
        b = input('')
        list1 = b.split()
        list1.sort()
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        out.append(sum(list2))
        del list1[:]
        del list2[:]
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It then calculates the sum of every second element from the sorted list of integers for each test case and prints these sums.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the maximum score by repeatedly picking two numbers from a list of 2n integers, adding the smaller of the two to the score, and removing both from the list, for a total of n moves.

The optimal strategy to maximize the score is to always pair the smallest available numbers together. This is because adding the smaller number of each pair to the score will yield the highest possible score.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of pairs) and then reads the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list of integers is sorted in ascending order. This allows us to easily pick the smallest numbers first.

3. **Pairing and Summing:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first (i.e., `list1[0]`, `list1[2]`, ..., `list1[2*(n-1)]`), and adds these to a new list `list2`.
   - The sum of `list2` is then added to the output list `out`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results.

### Correctness Check
- **Sorting:** Sorting the list ensures that we are always picking the smallest numbers first, which aligns with the optimal strategy.
- **Pairing:** By taking every second element from the sorted list, we are effectively pairing the smallest numbers together.
- **Summing:** The sum of the chosen numbers (`list2`) is the maximum score we can achieve for each test case.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy to solve the problem. It handles the input, sorts the numbers, pairs the smallest numbers together, and sums them up to produce the correct maximum score for each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
