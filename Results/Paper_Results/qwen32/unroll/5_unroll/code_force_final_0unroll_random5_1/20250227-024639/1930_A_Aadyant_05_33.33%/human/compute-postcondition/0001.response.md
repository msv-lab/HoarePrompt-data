The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `out`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `num` are not modified by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `out` is now an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and the list of integers `a` contains 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7; `num` is a string input by the user; `out` is an empty list.**
