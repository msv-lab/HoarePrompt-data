Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. Let's analyze the program and find a potential case where it does not work as expected.

The provided program calculates the number of triangular pieces based on the number of consecutive vertices that are exactly one apart. However, this approach does not account for all possible ways to form triangles with the given vertices.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
6 4 0
1 3 4 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
We can form the following triangles: (1, 3, 4), (3, 4, 6), and (1, 4, 6). This gives us a total of 3 triangles.

**Program Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of the Program Output:**
The program only counts the number of consecutive vertices that are exactly one apart. In this case, it only counts the gap between vertices 3 and 4, and between vertices 4 and 6, resulting in a count of 2.

This example shows that the program does not correctly account for all possible ways to form triangles with the given vertices. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible sets of three vertices and check if they can form a triangle without intersecting with other diagonals. This is a more complex task and would require a different approach than the one implemented in the given program.
