Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed in a regular polygon with `n` sides, given `x` vertices that have already been chosen and no additional vertices can be chosen (`y = 0`). The triangles must be formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals between the chosen vertices.

### Key Points:
1. **Vertices and Triangles**: Triangles can be formed by connecting three vertices with non-intersecting diagonals.
2. **No Additional Vertices**: Since `y = 0`, we can only use the `x` vertices already chosen.
3. **Counting Triangles**: We need to count the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed with these `x` vertices.

### Approach in the Code:
The code attempts to count the number of triangles by:
1. Sorting the list of chosen vertices.
2. Checking the gaps between consecutive vertices.
3. Counting how many gaps have exactly one vertex between them, as these gaps can potentially form triangles.
4. Also checking the gap between the first and last vertex considering the circular nature of the polygon.
5. Finally, adding `x - 2` to the count, which seems to be an incorrect assumption since it does not correctly account for the formation of triangles.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Triangle Counting**: The code incorrectly assumes that counting gaps with exactly one vertex between them and adding `x - 2` will give the correct number of triangles. This is not correct because forming triangles involves more complex combinatorial logic.
2. **Circular Nature of Polygon**: While the code attempts to handle the circular nature by checking the gap between the first and last vertex, it does not correctly account for all possible triangles.
3. **No Consideration for Non-Intersecting Diagonals**: The code does not ensure that the diagonals drawn do not intersect, which is a crucial requirement for forming non-intersecting triangles.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed. The logic for counting triangles is flawed and does not correctly account for the constraints and requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
