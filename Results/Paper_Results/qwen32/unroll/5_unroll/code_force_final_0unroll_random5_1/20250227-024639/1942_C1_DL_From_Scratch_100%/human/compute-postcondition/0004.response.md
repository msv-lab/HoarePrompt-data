Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the gaps between the integers in the list and their positions relative to the range from 1 to `n`.**
