### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, with the constraint that water can only be poured from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.

The core logic of the program is flawed. The program calculates a variable `curr` which is supposed to capture some condition that would determine if the water can be evenly distributed. However, the logic `curr += i - last` is not correct for this problem. Specifically, `curr` is supposed to track the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target amount (which is the average amount of water per container). The program incorrectly subtracts `last` from each element, which does not correctly model the problem.

The correct approach would be to calculate the target amount of water per container (which is the sum of all water divided by the number of containers, `n`). Then, for each container, calculate the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. If this cumulative difference is zero by the end of the list, it means the water can be evenly distributed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        target = sum(nums) // n  # Calculate the target amount of water per container
        curr = 0
        
        for i in nums:
            curr += i - target  # Calculate the cumulative difference
        
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

Given the current logic in the provided program, it does not correctly determine if the water can be evenly distributed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
