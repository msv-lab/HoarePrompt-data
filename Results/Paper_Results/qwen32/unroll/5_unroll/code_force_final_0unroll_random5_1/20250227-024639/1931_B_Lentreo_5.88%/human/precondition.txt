test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n. The length of the test_cases list is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
