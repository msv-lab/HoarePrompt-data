### Reasoning:

The program provided aims to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. The operation allows pouring water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.

The core logic of the program is flawed. The program calculates `curr` by iterating over the list and summing up the differences between each element and the last element. If `curr` is zero, it prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to equalize the water levels. However, this approach doesn't correctly address the problem requirements.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Condition**: The condition `curr == 0` is not a valid check for whether the water levels can be equalized. The program does not ensure that the sum of water in the containers can be evenly distributed among all containers.
2. **Logic Flaw**: The program does not correctly simulate the operation of pouring water from one container to another. It only checks the difference between each element and the last element, which is not sufficient to determine if the water can be evenly distributed.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. A correct approach would involve checking if the sum of the water in all containers can be evenly divided among the containers, and then simulating the pouring operations to ensure that all containers can reach the same level. The current program does not do this correctly.
