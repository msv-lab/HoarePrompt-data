Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100), `ans` is 0, `cnt` is an empty dictionary.**

The variable `cnt` is initialized as an empty dictionary, while the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
