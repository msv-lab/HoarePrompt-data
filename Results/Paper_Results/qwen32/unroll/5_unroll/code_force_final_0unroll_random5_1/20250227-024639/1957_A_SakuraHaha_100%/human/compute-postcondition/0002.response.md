The code snippet initializes a variable `ans` to 0. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `t`, `n`, and `a`, except for the new variable `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100), `ans` is 0.**
