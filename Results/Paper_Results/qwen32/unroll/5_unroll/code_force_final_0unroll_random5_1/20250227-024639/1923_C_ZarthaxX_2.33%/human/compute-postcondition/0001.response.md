The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and the queries are already defined. However, the code snippet does not directly interact with `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, or the queries. It only introduces a new list `nums` by reading from the input.

Given this, the output state will include the newly created list `nums` and retain the previous definitions of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and the queries.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; there are `q` queries, and for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.**
