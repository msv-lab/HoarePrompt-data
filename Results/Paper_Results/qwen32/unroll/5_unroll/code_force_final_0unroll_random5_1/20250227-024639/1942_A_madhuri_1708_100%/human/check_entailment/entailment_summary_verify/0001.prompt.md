You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it outputs either a list of `k` integers where each integer is `k`, or `-1`, based on the conditions: if `k` is at least 2 and `n` equals `k`, it outputs the list; otherwise, it outputs `-1`. If `k` is less than 2, it outputs a list of the first `n` positive integers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Sorted Array**: An array is sorted if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
2. **Cyclic Shifts**: For an array `a` of length `n`, the `x`-th cyclic shift is obtained by moving the first `x-1` elements to the end of the array.
3. **Task**: Given integers `n` and `k`, find an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted.
4. **Constraints**: 
   - \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3\)
   - \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)
   - If no such array exists, output `-1`.

### Program Analysis:

The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one as follows:
1. **For \(k \geq 2\)**:
   - If \(n == k\), it outputs an array of `n` elements, all equal to `k`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `-1`.
2. **For \(k = 1\)**:
   - It outputs the array `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.

### Correctness Evaluation:

1. **Case \(k \geq 2\)**:
   - **When \(n == k\)**:
     - The array `[k, k, ..., k]` (with `n` elements, all equal to `k`) will have all `n` cyclic shifts equal to itself, which is a sorted array.
     - This satisfies the condition of having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts, since `k == n`.
   - **When \(n > k\)**:
     - The program outputs `-1`, implying no valid array exists.
     - This is correct because if `n > k`, there is no way to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts without having more than `k` sorted shifts (since having all elements equal would result in all cyclic shifts being sorted).
   
2. **Case \(k = 1\)**:
   - The program outputs the array `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
   - This array is sorted, and all other cyclic shifts will not be sorted because they will start with a larger number.
   - Therefore, there will be exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which satisfies the requirement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases as per the problem requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
