Let's analyze the provided program in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Sorted Array**: An array is sorted if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
2. **Cyclic Shifts**: For an array `a` of length `n`, the `x`-th cyclic shift is obtained by moving the first `x-1` elements to the end of the array.
3. **Task**: Given integers `n` and `k`, find an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted.
4. **Constraints**: 
   - \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3\)
   - \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)
   - If no such array exists, output `-1`.

### Program Analysis:

The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one as follows:
1. **For \(k \geq 2\)**:
   - If \(n == k\), it outputs an array of `n` elements, all equal to `k`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `-1`.
2. **For \(k = 1\)**:
   - It outputs the array `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.

### Correctness Evaluation:

1. **Case \(k \geq 2\)**:
   - **When \(n == k\)**:
     - The array `[k, k, ..., k]` (with `n` elements, all equal to `k`) will have all `n` cyclic shifts equal to itself, which is a sorted array.
     - This satisfies the condition of having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts, since `k == n`.
   - **When \(n > k\)**:
     - The program outputs `-1`, implying no valid array exists.
     - This is correct because if `n > k`, there is no way to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts without having more than `k` sorted shifts (since having all elements equal would result in all cyclic shifts being sorted).
   
2. **Case \(k = 1\)**:
   - The program outputs the array `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
   - This array is sorted, and all other cyclic shifts will not be sorted because they will start with a larger number.
   - Therefore, there will be exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which satisfies the requirement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases as per the problem requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
