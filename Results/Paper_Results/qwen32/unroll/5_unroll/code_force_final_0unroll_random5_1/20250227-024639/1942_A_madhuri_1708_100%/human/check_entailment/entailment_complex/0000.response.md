### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by generating an array based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. Let's analyze the logic of the program and compare it to the requirements of the problem.

The program processes each test case as follows:
1. **If `k >= 2`:**
   - **If `n == k`:** The program outputs an array where all elements are equal to `k`.
     - **Explanation:** This is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of an array where all elements are equal will be sorted. Since `n == k`, this satisfies the requirement of having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.
   - **If `n != k`:** The program outputs `-1`.
     - **Explanation:** If `n` is not equal to `k`, it is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts among `n` cyclic shifts when `k >= 2`. This is because having all elements equal is the only way to ensure all cyclic shifts are sorted, which requires `n == k`.
2. **If `k < 2`:**
   - The program outputs an array of the first `n` positive integers `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
     - **Explanation:** This is a valid solution because only the first cyclic shift (which is the array itself) will be sorted. All other cyclic shifts will not be sorted since the array is strictly increasing.

Let's verify the examples provided in the problem statement:
- **Test case 1:** `n = 2, k = 2`
  - The program outputs `1 1`.
  - This is correct because the two cyclic shifts `[1, 1]` and `[1, 1]` are both sorted.
- **Test case 2:** `n = 3, k = 1`
  - The program outputs `1 2 3`.
  - This is correct because only the first cyclic shift `[1, 2, 3]` is sorted.
- **Test case 3:** `n = 3, k = 2`
  - The program outputs `-1`.
  - This is correct because it is impossible to have exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts out of 3 when the array is strictly increasing.

The logic for the program is consistent with the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
