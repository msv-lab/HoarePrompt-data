Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the reasoning behind the original assessment to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves a circular arrangement of coins where players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins left, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The task is to determine if Alice (who goes first) will win if both players play optimally.

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins and determines the winner based on the parity of this count:
- If the count of 'U' coins is odd, it prints "YES" (indicating Alice wins).
- If the count of 'U' coins is even, it prints "NO" (indicating Bob wins).

### Function Summary

The function `func_1` reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the result based on the parity of the count of 'U' coins.

### Reasoning

The original assessment provides a detailed explanation of why the parity of the count of 'U' coins determines the winner:
1. **Odd Number of 'U' Coins:**
   - Alice can always remove a 'U' coin, leaving an even number of 'U' coins for Bob.
   - Bob will then be forced to remove a 'U' coin, leaving an odd number of 'U' coins for Alice again.
   - This pattern continues until there is only one 'U' coin left, which Alice can remove, making Bob the one who cannot make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

2. **Even Number of 'U' Coins:**
   - Alice removes a 'U' coin, leaving an odd number of 'U' coins for Bob.
   - Bob can then remove a 'U' coin, leaving an even number of 'U' coins for Alice again.
   - This pattern continues until there are two 'U' coins left.
   - At this point, Alice removes one 'U' coin, leaving one 'U' coin for Bob.
   - Bob can then remove the last 'U' coin, and Alice cannot make a move. Hence, Bob wins.

### Verification

The explanation provided in the original assessment is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements. The strategy of counting the number of 'U' coins and determining the winner based on their parity is indeed optimal and covers all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the strategy described above and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

**Final: True**
