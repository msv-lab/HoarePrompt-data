Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the input, while the conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.
