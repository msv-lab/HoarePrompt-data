To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether the program correctly computes the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the array `a` and the elements of `a`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The program sorts the array `N` which is a copy of `a`.

3. **Tracking MEX:**
   - It initializes `cur` to -1 and a dictionary `M` to keep track of the count of each number in `N`.
   - It then iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it breaks the loop after setting `cur` to `cur + 1`. Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and updates the count in `M`.
     - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.

4. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - After the loop, if the sum of counts in `M` equals `S` (the size of the array), it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates from 0 to `cur` to find the smallest index `i` where `M[i] <= i`. If such an index is found, it sets `cur` to `i`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `cur` which is supposed to be the MEX of the array `c` after optimal play.

### Correctness Check:

Let's analyze the correctness of the program:

- **Sorting and Tracking MEX:**
  - The sorting step ensures that we process the smallest numbers first, which is crucial for MEX calculation.
  - The dictionary `M` correctly tracks the count of each number up to `cur`.

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles cases where there are repeated numbers and gaps in the sequence.
  - The final check to see if the sum of counts equals `S` ensures that if all numbers up to `cur` are present, the MEX is `cur + 1`.

- **Optimal Play:**
  - The program's logic to track and update `cur` based on the counts in `M` aligns with the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
  - Alice will try to maximize the MEX by adding numbers that extend the sequence, while Bob will try to minimize it by removing numbers that could extend the sequence.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly computes the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. It handles the edge cases and the logic for optimal play is correctly implemented.

**Correctness: True**
