t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple corresponds to a test case and is structured as (n, x), with n being an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x being a list of n-1 integers where each integer xi satisfies 1 ≤ xi ≤ 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
