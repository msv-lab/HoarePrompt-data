Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The problem requires us to find an array \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\) such that:
- \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) for all \(1 \le i \le n\).
- \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\).

The provided program attempts to generate such an array \(a\) for each test case. Here's a breakdown of its approach:

1. **Initialization**: It initializes the first element of array \(a\) to 500.
2. **Generating the Array**:
   - For each subsequent element \(a_i\) (where \(i \ge 2\)), it sets \(a_i\) to \(a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\).
3. **Output**: It prints the array \(a\) for each test case.

Let's check if this approach satisfies the conditions of the problem:

- **Condition 1**: \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).
  - The first element \(a_0\) is set to 500, which satisfies the condition.
  - For subsequent elements, \(a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\). Since \(x_i \le 500\), and \(a_0 = 500\), the maximum possible value of \(a_i\) will be \(500 + 500 + \dots + 500\) (up to \(n-1\) times), which is \(500 \times n\). Given \(n \le 500\), the maximum value of \(a_i\) will be \(500 \times 500 = 250000\), which is well within the \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) range.

- **Condition 2**: \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\).
  - By the construction \(a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\), we have \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = (a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}) \bmod a_{i-1} = x_{i-1}\). This satisfies the condition.

Given these points, the program correctly constructs an array \(a\) that meets the problem's requirements for each test case.

**Conclusion**: The program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
