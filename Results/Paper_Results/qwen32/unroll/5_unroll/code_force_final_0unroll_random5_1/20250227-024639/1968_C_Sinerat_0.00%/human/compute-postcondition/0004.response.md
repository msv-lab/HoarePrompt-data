Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It then constructs and prints a list `a` of length `n` where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.**
