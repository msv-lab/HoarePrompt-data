The only object in the loop head of the provided `for` loop is the underscore `_` which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used. The loop iterates over the range of an integer value obtained from `int(input())`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the value that `int(input())` returns, which is `t` in this context.

For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1. Given the constraints, `t` is already defined to be in the range 1 to 10^4, which means it will always be at least 1 and the loop will execute at least `t` times.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used and does not affect the execution of the loop, there is no need to adjust its state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
