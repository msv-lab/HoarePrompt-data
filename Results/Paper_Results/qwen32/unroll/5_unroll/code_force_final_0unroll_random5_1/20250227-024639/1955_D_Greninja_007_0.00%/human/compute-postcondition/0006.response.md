Postcondition: **`good_subarrays` is the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` matching elements with `b` based on frequency. `window_freq` reflects the frequency of elements in the last `m` elements of `a`. `matches` reflects the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements in the last `m` elements of `a` that also appear in `b`. The current value of `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
