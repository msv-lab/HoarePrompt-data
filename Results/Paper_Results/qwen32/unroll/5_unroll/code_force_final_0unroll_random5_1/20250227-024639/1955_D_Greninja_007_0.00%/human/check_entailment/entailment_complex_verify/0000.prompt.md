You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description to ensure it handles all potential cases correctly.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Maxim has an array `a` of `n` integers and an array `b` of `m` integers.
- We need to find the number of subsegments of array `a` of length `m` (denoted as `c`) such that `c` can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of array `b`.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a sliding window approach with the help of `Counter` from the `collections` module to efficiently count matching elements between the current window of `a` and `b`.

### Key Points:
1. **Initial Window Setup**:
   - The program initializes a frequency counter `b_freq` for array `b`.
   - It then initializes a frequency counter `window_freq` for the first `m` elements of array `a`.
   - The number of matching elements `matches` is calculated by summing the minimum of the counts of each element in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program slides the window across array `a` from the first position to the last possible position (`n - m + 1`).
   - For each new position, it updates the `window_freq` by removing the element that is sliding out of the window and adding the new element that is sliding into the window.
   - It updates the `matches` count accordingly.

3. **Counting Good Subarrays**:
   - If the number of matches in the current window is at least `k`, it increments the count of good subarrays.

4. **Final Window Check**:
   - After the loop, it performs a final check for the last window.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Initialization and First Window**: The program correctly initializes the first window and calculates the initial number of matches.
- **Sliding Window Mechanism**: The mechanism to slide the window and update the `matches` count is correct. It ensures that the program efficiently keeps track of the number of matching elements as the window moves.
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - **Single Element Arrays**: The program handles cases where `m = 1` correctly.
  - **Full Matches**: The program correctly identifies when a window fully matches `b`.
  - **No Matches**: The program correctly identifies when no elements in the window match `b`.
  - **Partial Matches**: The program correctly identifies when a window has at least `k` matches.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, it seems to handle all the necessary cases as described in the problem statement. The sliding window approach ensures that the program runs efficiently even for large input sizes.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The program correctly implements a sliding window approach to efficiently count the number of good subarrays in `a` that can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of `b`. It handles all edge cases and efficiently updates the count of matching elements as the window slides across `a`.
