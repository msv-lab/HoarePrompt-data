### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of `m` cubes after performing `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube.

The key observation is that:
- If `n` (number of moves) is less than `m` (number of cubes desired), it's impossible to achieve `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n`.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, then it's possible to reach `m` cubes if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This is because:
  - Each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) leaves the number of cubes unchanged.
  - If `n - m` is even, then the excess moves (after reaching `m` cubes) can be paired up as additions and removals, leaving the final count at `m`.
  - If `n - m` is odd, then there will be one unpaired move, which means the final count cannot be exactly `m`.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
