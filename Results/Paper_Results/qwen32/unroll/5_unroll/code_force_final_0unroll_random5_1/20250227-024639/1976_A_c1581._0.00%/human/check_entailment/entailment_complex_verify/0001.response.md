### Reasoning:
Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code.

1. **Problem Requirements Recap:**
   - The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - There should be no digit that comes after a letter (i.e., after each letter, there is either another letter or the end of the string).
   - All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It processes each test case by calling the function `func_1(password)` to check if the password is strong.
   - **Function `func_1(password)`:**
     - It initializes two lists, `digits` and `letters`.
     - It iterates over each character in the password:
       - If the character is a digit, it appends it to `digits`.
       - If the character is a letter, it appends it to `letters`.
     - It then checks if any letter follows a digit by keeping track of the last digit's index (`last_digit_index`).
     - If a letter is found after a digit, it returns 'NO'.
     - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted and if the `letters` list is sorted.
     - If both conditions are met, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Verification with Annotated Code:**
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly separates digits and letters.
   - The `last_digit_index` is accurately used to ensure no letter follows a digit.
   - The sorted checks for `digits` and `letters` are correctly implemented.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles passwords with only digits or only letters correctly.
   - It correctly identifies invalid passwords where a digit follows a letter or where the digits or letters are not sorted.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description. The annotations and the original assessment both confirm that the logic is sound and the program behaves as expected for valid inputs.

**Final: True**
