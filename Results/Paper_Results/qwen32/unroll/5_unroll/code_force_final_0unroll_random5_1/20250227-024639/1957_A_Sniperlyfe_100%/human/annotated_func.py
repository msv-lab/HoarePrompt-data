#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements where the first element of each pair n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) represents the number of sticks available for that test case, and the next n elements are integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: arr is [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], freq is {2: 2, 3: 2, 1: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1}.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where the first element represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements for each test case. Each pair consists of a number of sticks and their respective lengths. The function calculates the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique stick length by 3 across all test cases and returns this sum. However, due to the specific implementation details, the function always returns 0.
