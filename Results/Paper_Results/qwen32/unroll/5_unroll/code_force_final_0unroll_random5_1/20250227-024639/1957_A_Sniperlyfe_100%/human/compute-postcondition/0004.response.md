Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` of the list represents the number of test cases. Following this, for each test case, there is a pair of elements where the first element `n` represents the number of sticks, and the subsequent `n` elements are integers representing the lengths of the sticks. Regardless of the input values provided, the function always returns 0.**
