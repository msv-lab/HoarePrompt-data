Correctness: **False**

The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the problem described:

1. **Function `func_1` is used before its definition**: In Python, functions must be defined before they are used. The program uses `func_1` before defining it.

2. **Logic for splitting elements is incorrect**: The program attempts to split an element if it is greater than 10 and the previous element is greater than the current element. However, it does not handle the case where the split operation might affect the order of subsequent elements. It also does not correctly handle the insertion of the split digits back into the list.

3. **The program does not attempt to sort the list after all possible splits**: The program should repeatedly attempt to split elements and check if the list can be sorted, but it does not do this in a loop.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    return all(lst[i] <= lst[i + 1] for i in range(len(lst) - 1))

def can_be_sorted(lst):
    changed = True
    while changed:
        changed = False
        for i in range(len(lst)):
            if lst[i] >= 10:
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(lst[i])]
                lst[i:i+1] = digits
                changed = True
                break
    return is_sorted(lst)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(lst):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

In this corrected version:
- The `is_sorted` function checks if a list is sorted.
- The `can_be_sorted` function repeatedly attempts to split elements that are 10 or greater and checks if the resulting list can be sorted.
- The main loop reads the input and checks each test case using the `can_be_sorted` function.
