Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not always compute the maximum total difference D correctly. The strategy of incrementing `i` and `j` based on the comparison of `t1` and `t2` does not guarantee that the maximum sum of differences is achieved. A more effective approach would be to pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `c` and vice versa to maximize the differences.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        c = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        c.sort()
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n):
            ans += max(abs(a[i] - c[-i-1]), abs(a[i] - c[i]))
        print(ans)

func()
```

This version sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` in ascending order, then calculates the maximum difference for each element in `a` by comparing it with the corresponding elements from the start and end of `c`. This ensures that the maximum possible differences are considered.
