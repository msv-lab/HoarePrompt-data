Reasoning:
The problem requires us to find the maximum total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) where \( c_i \) is a permutation of \( n \) chosen integers from the list \( b_i \). The strategy to maximize \( D \) is to pair the smallest elements of \( a \) with the largest elements of \( b \) and vice versa.

The program correctly implements this strategy:
1. **Input Parsing**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( m \), the list \( a \), and the list \( b \).
2. **Special Cases Handling**: It handles the special case where all elements in both \( a \) and \( b \) are the same, in which case the output is 0.
3. **Sorting**: It sorts list \( a \) in ascending order and list \( b \) in descending order.
4. **Difference Calculation**: It calculates the total difference by pairing the smallest element of \( a \) with the largest element of \( b \) and vice versa, ensuring to maximize the absolute difference for each pair.
5. **Output**: It prints the maximum total difference for each test case.

The logic in the function aligns with the problem's requirements, and the provided annotated states correctly describe the behavior of the function. The program handles all edge cases and efficiently computes the desired result.

Correctness: **True**
