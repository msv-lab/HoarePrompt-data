You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

    #State: For each test case, the output will be a single integer representing the minimum possible sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two lists after sorting one list in ascending order and the other in descending order, with special cases handled for uniform lists and single-element lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum possible sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two lists after sorting one list in ascending order and the other in descending order. Special cases are handled for lists with identical elements and single-element lists.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to maximize the total difference \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\) by selecting \(n\) integers from the array \(b_i\) and arranging them to form the array \(c_i\).

### Approach Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the values of \(n\) and \(m\), the array \(a_i\), and the array \(b_i\).

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if both \(a\) and \(c\) (initially \(b\)) have the same single element. If they do, the maximum difference \(D\) is 0 because all elements are the same.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The program sorts \(a\) in ascending order and \(c\) in descending order. This is a key step because it ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first.

4. **Greedy Selection:**
   - The program uses a greedy approach to select elements from \(c\) to maximize the differences:
     - It maintains two pointers, `i` and `j`, to traverse \(a\) from the start and end, respectively.
     - For each element in \(a\), it calculates the potential differences using the smallest and largest remaining elements in \(c\).
     - It chooses the larger of these differences and adds it to the total difference \(D\).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where \(n = 1\) separately, calculating the maximum difference by comparing the single element of \(a\) with the maximum and minimum elements of \(c\).

### Correctness Verification:

- **Sorting and Greedy Selection:**
  - Sorting \(a\) and \(c\) in opposite orders and then using a greedy approach to maximize the differences is a correct strategy. This ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first, leading to an optimal solution.

- **Special Cases:**
  - The special case where all elements in \(a\) and \(c\) are the same is correctly handled by returning 0.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The edge case where \(n = 1\) is also correctly handled by comparing the single element of \(a\) with the maximum and minimum elements of \(c\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the total difference \(D\). It handles all specified cases and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
