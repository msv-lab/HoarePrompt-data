In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `_` and the range is determined by `int(input())`. This means the loop will execute `int(input())` times, which corresponds to the number of test cases `t`. The state before the loop starts includes `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i`. However, according to the task, we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is just `t` (since `_` is not a variable we can directly set).

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1 because the loop will iterate `t` times. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`) are defined within each iteration of the loop and do not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100**
