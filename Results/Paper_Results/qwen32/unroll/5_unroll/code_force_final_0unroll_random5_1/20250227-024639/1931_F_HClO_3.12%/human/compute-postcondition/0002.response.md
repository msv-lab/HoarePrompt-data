Output State: **For each test case, the program will print either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a_{ij}`, and the lists `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val` will be in their final states after processing all inputs for that test case. The specific values of these variables will depend on the input provided, but they will not affect the output beyond the current test case.**
