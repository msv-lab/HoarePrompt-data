Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed for it to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Catching and Throwing the Quaffle:**
   - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player who is catching the Quaffle.
   - The logic for throwing the Quaffle is incorrect. The Quaffle should always move to the middle of the field when thrown, regardless of the player's team.

2. **Incorrect Goal Scoring Logic:**
   - The program checks if the player is in a goal, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where the player scores in their own goal.
   - The program should check if the player is in the opponent's goal and then update the score accordingly.

3. **Incorrect Elimination Handling:**
   - The program prints the elimination message but does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple players are eliminated at the same time.
   - The program should ensure that the players are eliminated in alphabetical order.

4. **Incorrect Movement Function:**
   - The `func_1` function is not defined before it is used. The function definition should be placed before its usage.

5. **Incorrect Quaffle Position Handling:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the Quaffle's position when it is being carried by a player. The Quaffle should stay in the same position as the player until it is thrown.

6. **Incorrect Goal Checking:**
   - The program checks if the player's position is in the goals list, but it should check if the Quaffle's position is in the goals list when the player throws the Quaffle.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)

(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        if '.B' in players:
            eliminated = []
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    eliminated.append(k)
            eliminated.sort()
            for k in eliminated:
                print(i, k, 'ELIMINATED')
                if quidditch[1] == k:
                    quidditch = [v, '']
                del players[k]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        if players[mo[0]] == quidditch[0]:
            quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        if quidditch[1] == mo[0]:
            quidditch[1] = ''
            quidditch[0] = middle
            if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
                if mo[0][0] == 'B':
                    pointsb += 1
                    print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
                else:
                    pointsr += 1
                    print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
                if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                    pointsr += 1
                    print(i, 'RED GOAL')
                else:
                    pointsb += 1
                    print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned above and should correctly solve the problem.
