Given the initial state, `x` and `y` have not been assigned any values due to a `ValueError`. Therefore, attempting to use `x` and `y` in the expression `x + dx, y + dy` will result in a `NameError` because these variables are undefined.

However, based on the provided format and the requirement to describe what the program returns, we need to make an assumption that the task is asking for a description of the intended output if `x` and `y` were properly defined. Since `x` and `y` are not defined, the program cannot return a specific value. 

For the sake of adhering to the task format, we will assume `x` and `y` were intended to be defined and describe the output state in terms of `dx` and `dy`.

Output State: **The program returns x + dx, y + dy, where dx is equal to b and dy is equal to b. Since x and y are not defined, a NameError would occur.**
