The function `add(a, b)` is not related to the problem described. The input variables for the problem are N and M (integers representing the dimensions of the field where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd), the field (a 2D list of strings representing the field's entities), T (an integer representing the number of steps where 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000), and the actions (a list of strings representing the actions performed by the entities). Each action is a string that includes the entity performing the action and the action itself.
