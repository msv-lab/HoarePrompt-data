### Reasoning:

The provided program `func_1` is designed to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `inf` is set to `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1` (which is 200001). This is to ensure that the program can handle the maximum possible value of `n` (which is 200000) plus an extra index for zero-based indexing.
   - A list `values` of size `inf` is initialized with all elements set to 0. This list will store the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to the respective index.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program then precomputes the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200000.
   - For each number `i` from 1 to 200000, it calculates the sum of its digits (`sum_value_digits`) by converting the number to a string, iterating over each character (digit), converting it back to an integer, and summing these integers.
   - The cumulative sum of the digit sums up to `i` is stored in `values[i]`, which is the sum of `values[i - 1]` (the cumulative sum up to `i - 1`) and `sum_value_digits` (the digit sum of `i`).

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to `n` from the precomputed list `values`.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  7
  12
  1
  2
  3
  1434
  2024
  200000
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  51
  1
  3
  6
  18465
  28170
  4600002
  ```

The program correctly computes the cumulative sum of the digit sums for each `n` based on the precomputed list `values`. Therefore, the output matches the expected output for the given example.

### Conclusion:

The program is correctly implemented and efficiently handles the problem constraints. It precomputes the necessary values and uses them to quickly answer each test case.

**Correctness: True**
