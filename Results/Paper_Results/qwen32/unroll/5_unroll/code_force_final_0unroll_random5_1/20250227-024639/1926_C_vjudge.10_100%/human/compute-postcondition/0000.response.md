The provided code snippet only initializes a variable `inf` with a specific value. It does not affect the input values `t` or `n` in any way. Therefore, the values of `t` and `n` remain as they were in the initial state.

The initial state includes:
- `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case.

The only change is the introduction of the variable `inf` with the value `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1`.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case; `inf` is 200001.**
