Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code has a logical error in the function definition and invocation order. The function `func_1()` is called at the beginning of the script before its definition, which will result in a `NameError`. This is a syntax error and the program will not execute at all, let alone produce the correct output.

To fix this, the function `func_1()` should be defined before it is called. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        print(values[value])

func_1()
```

With this change, the program should work correctly for all the given constraints and examples. However, since the original code does not compile due to the syntax error, it is considered incorrect.
