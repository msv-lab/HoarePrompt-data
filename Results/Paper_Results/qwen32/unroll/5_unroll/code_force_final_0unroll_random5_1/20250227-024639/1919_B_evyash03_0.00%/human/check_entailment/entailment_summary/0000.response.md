### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its execution summary to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- We are given a string `s` consisting of '+' and '-'.
- We need to split this string into non-empty parts such that the sum of penalties is minimized.
- The penalty for a part is the absolute value of the sum of its elements (where '+' contributes +1 and '-' contributes -1) multiplied by the length of the part.
- The goal is to find the optimal way to split the string to minimize the total penalty.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program does not directly implement a strategy to find the optimal split that minimizes the total penalty. Instead, it seems to be counting the number of times the cumulative balance of the string goes negative and resetting it, plus adding 1 if the final balance is positive.

Let's break down the program:
1. **Splitting the String:**
   - `parts = expression.split('-')`: This splits the string `expression` by '-', which does not necessarily help in finding the optimal split for minimizing penalties.
   - `result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))`: This calculates the total length of parts that do not contain '-', which is not relevant to the problem.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates through the string, maintaining a `balance` that is incremented for '+' and decremented for '-'.
   - It counts how many times the `balance` goes negative and resets it to 0.
   - It adds 1 to the count if the final `balance` is greater than 0.

#### Flaws in the Program:
- The program does not consider the penalty formula, which involves the absolute value of the sum of a part multiplied by its length.
- The program does not attempt to split the string into parts to minimize the total penalty; instead, it focuses on the number of times the cumulative balance goes negative.
- The provided execution summary describes the behavior of the function but does not correlate it with the problem's requirements for minimizing the penalty.

#### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not implement a strategy to find the optimal split that minimizes the total penalty.

**Correctness: False**

The program's logic and output do not align with the problem's objective of finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array.
