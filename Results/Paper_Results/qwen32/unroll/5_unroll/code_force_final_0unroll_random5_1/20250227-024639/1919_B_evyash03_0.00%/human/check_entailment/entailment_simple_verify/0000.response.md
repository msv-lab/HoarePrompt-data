Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to split the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The goal is to find an optimal way to split the array to achieve the minimum total penalty.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by defining a function `func_1`, which iterates through the string `expression` and keeps track of a `balance` (sum of +1 and -1). It increments a `count` variable whenever the balance goes negative and resets it to zero. Finally, it returns the sum of `count` and a check if the final balance is greater than zero.

#### Annotated Code Review

1. **Splitting by '-'**: The line `parts = expression.split('-')` splits the string by '-', which does not align with the optimal splitting strategy described in the problem. This step does not contribute to finding the optimal split.

2. **Balance Calculation**: The loop inside `func_1` correctly updates the balance as it iterates through the string. However, the logic to determine the optimal split is flawed.

3. **Counting Negative Balance**: The `count` variable increments whenever the balance goes negative, which is not a correct way to determine the optimal split points. The optimal split should minimize the total penalty, not just count the number of segments where the balance goes negative.

4. **Final Balance Check**: The return statement `return count + (balance > 0)` does not correctly compute the penalty for each segment. It only counts the number of times the balance goes negative and checks if the final balance is positive.

### Example Analysis

Let's revisit the counterexample provided in the original assessment:

**Input:**
```
1
6
+-+--+
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- One optimal way to split the array is: `[+,-],[+,-,-],[+]`. 
- The penalties for these segments are:
  - `|[+,-]| * 2 = 0 * 2 = 0`
  - `|[+,-,-]| * 3 = 1 * 3 = 3`
  - `|[+]| * 1 = 1 * 1 = 1`
- Total penalty: `0 + 3 + 1 = 4`

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
3
```

The program does not correctly compute the minimum penalty for all possible splits of the array. It fails to consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The logic in the function `func_1` does not properly handle the calculation of penalties for all possible splits of the array.

**Final: False**
