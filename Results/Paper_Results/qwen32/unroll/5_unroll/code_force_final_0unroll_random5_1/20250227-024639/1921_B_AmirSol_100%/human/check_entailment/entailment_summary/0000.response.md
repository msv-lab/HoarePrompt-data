### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of cats in the boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`). The possible operations are adding a cat to an empty box, removing a cat from a box, or moving a cat from one box to another.

The provided solution calculates two values:
1. `cats_to_add`: The number of positions where a cat needs to be added (i.e., positions where `s1` has '0' and `s2` has '1').
2. `cats_to_remove`: The number of positions where a cat needs to be removed (i.e., positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0').

The function then returns the maximum of these two values. This is correct because:
- If there are more positions that need cats added than removed, the limiting factor is the number of additions required.
- If there are more positions that need cats removed than added, the limiting factor is the number of removals required.
- If the number of additions and removals is equal, the number of moves required is equal to either of these counts.

Thus, the maximum of `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove` gives the minimum number of operations required to achieve the desired state.
