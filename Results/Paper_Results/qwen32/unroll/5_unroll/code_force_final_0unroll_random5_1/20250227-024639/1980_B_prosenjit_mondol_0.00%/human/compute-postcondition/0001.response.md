Output State: **The output state consists of 't' test cases, each with a result printed as either 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' based on the comparison of the f-th and k-th elements of the sorted list 'a'. The values of 't', 'n', 'f', 'k', and the list 'a' for each test case remain unchanged after the loop execution.**
