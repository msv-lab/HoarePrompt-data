### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations. The program processes each test case by checking the first and last rows and the first and last columns of the grid. Here is a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row as a string in the list `a`.

2. **Constructing `first_row` and `last_row`:**
   - `first_row` is constructed by concatenating the first character of each row.
   - `last_row` is constructed by concatenating the last character of each row.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if the first row (`a[0]`) consists of a single character (i.e., all 'W' or all 'B') and if the last row (`a[-1]`) also consists of a single character. If both conditions are true and the first and last rows are different, it prints "NO".
   - Similarly, it checks if `first_row` consists of a single character and if `last_row` also consists of a single character. If both conditions are true and `first_row` and `last_row` are different, it prints "NO".
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "YES".

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Logic:**
  - If the first and last rows are identical and consist of the same character, then it is impossible to change the color of the grid to a uniform color because the operation requires selecting two squares of the same color to change the subrectangle between them. If the first and last rows are the same, then there is no way to change the color of the grid to the opposite color without breaking the uniformity of the first and last rows.
  - Similarly, if the first and last columns are identical and consist of the same character but are different from each other, it is also impossible to change the color of the grid to a uniform color.
  - If neither of these conditions is met, it means there is a possibility to change the colors of the grid to make them uniform. This is because there exists at least one row or column that can be used to propagate the color change across the grid.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as grids with a single row or a single column correctly.
  - It also handles cases where the grid is already uniform by printing "YES".

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color based on the given operations. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
