To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to decide if all squares in the grid can be made the same color using the allowed operations.

### Analysis:

The core idea of the problem is to determine if it's possible to make the entire grid one uniform color by repeatedly selecting two squares of the same color and coloring the entire subrectangle between them with that color.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Color Rows and Columns**: If all rows or all columns are already of the same color, then it's possible to make the entire grid that color. This is because you can select any two squares in the same row or column and color the entire row or column.

2. **Contradictory First and Last Rows/Columns**: If the first row and the last row are both uniform but of different colors, and the first column and the last column are both uniform but of different colors, then it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform. This is because you would need to make the entire grid one color, but the first row and last row being of different colors and the first column and last column being of different colors create a contradiction.

### Program Logic:
The program checks:
- If the first row and the last row are both uniform but of different colors.
- If the first column and the last column are both uniform but of different colors.

If both of these conditions are true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Correctness of the Program:

The program correctly handles the cases where the first row and last row are uniform but of different colors, and the first column and last column are uniform but of different colors. If either of these conditions is met, it correctly concludes that it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform.

However, it doesn't fully account for all possible configurations. For example, if there are multiple rows and columns that are uniform but of different colors in a way that doesn't directly contradict the first and last rows/columns, the program might still print "YES" incorrectly.

### Counterexample:
Consider a grid where the first row is "W" and the last row is "B", but there are other rows in between that are uniform and of the same color. The program might incorrectly print "YES" in such cases because it only checks the first and last rows/columns.

### Conclusion:
The program is not fully correct because it doesn't handle all possible configurations of the grid correctly.

**Correctness: False**
