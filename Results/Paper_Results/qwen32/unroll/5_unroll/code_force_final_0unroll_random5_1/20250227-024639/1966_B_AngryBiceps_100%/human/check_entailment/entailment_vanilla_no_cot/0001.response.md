Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color using the given operation. The operation allows us to select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them with that color.

### Key Observations

1. **Identical Rows and Columns**: 
   - If all squares in the grid can be made the same color, then there must be at least one row or one column where all squares are the same color. This is because any operation can only affect a subrectangle, and to make the entire grid uniform, we need a starting point with uniform color in at least one row or column.
   
2. **Contradictory Rows and Columns**:
   - If there is a row where all squares are of one color (say 'W') and another row where all squares are of the opposite color (say 'B'), and similarly, a column with all 'W' and another column with all 'B', then it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because the operation cannot change the color of squares in a row or column that are already uniform and of different colors.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution checks the following conditions:

1. **Uniform First and Last Rows**:
   - It checks if the first and last rows are uniform (all squares in the row are the same color) and if they are of different colors. If both conditions are true, it prints "NO".
   
2. **Uniform First and Last Columns**:
   - It checks if the first and last columns are uniform (all squares in the column are the same color) and if they are of different colors. If both conditions are true, it prints "NO".
   
3. **Otherwise**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "YES".

### Correctness

The solution is based on the observation that if there is a row or column where all squares are of one color and another row or column where all squares are of the opposite color, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform. This is a valid observation and the solution correctly checks for these conditions.

However, the solution does not fully cover all possible scenarios. For example, it does not check for cases where there are multiple rows or columns with different uniform colors. It only checks the first and last rows and columns, which might not be sufficient to determine the possibility of making the entire grid uniform.

### Conclusion

While the provided solution works for the given examples, it does not cover all possible scenarios and might incorrectly print "YES" for some cases where it is actually impossible to make the entire grid uniform. Therefore, the solution is not completely correct.

Correctness: **False**
