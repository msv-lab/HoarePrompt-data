### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operation. The key insight is that if the first and last rows (or the first and last columns) are both uniform (all the same color) and different from each other, then it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform. This is because the operation can only change the color of a subrectangle, and if the first and last rows (or columns) are different, there will always be a boundary that cannot be uniformly colored without affecting the uniformity of the first or last row (or column).

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself.
3. It constructs two strings: `first_row` consisting of the first character of each row and `last_row` consisting of the last character of each row.
4. It checks if the first and last rows are uniform and different from each other.
5. It checks if the first and last columns (by constructing `first_row` and `last_row`) are uniform and different from each other.
6. If either of these conditions is true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
