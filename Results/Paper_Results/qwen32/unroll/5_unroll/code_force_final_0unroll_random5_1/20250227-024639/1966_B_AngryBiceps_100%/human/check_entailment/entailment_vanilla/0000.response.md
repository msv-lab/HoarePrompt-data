Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks to determine if it's possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color using a specific operation. The operation allows us to select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color. The goal is to determine if all squares can be made the same color after performing any number of such operations.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Color Rows and Columns**: If the first and last rows (or columns) of the grid are both single-colored (i.e., all squares in the row or column are the same color), and the colors of these rows (or columns) are different, then it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because the operation can only change the color of squares within the subrectangle defined by the selected squares, and it cannot cross the boundary of different single-colored rows or columns.

2. **General Case**: If the grid does not meet the above condition, it is possible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because we can always use the operation to expand the single-colored regions until the entire grid is of the same color.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution checks the following conditions:
- If the first and last rows are both single-colored and have different colors, it prints "NO".
- If the first and last columns are both single-colored and have different colors, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Correctness of the Solution:
The solution correctly implements the key observations. If the first and last rows (or columns) are both single-colored and have different colors, it is indeed impossible to make the entire grid the same color, and the solution correctly returns "NO". In all other cases, it correctly returns "YES".

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is correct based on the problem description and the key observations derived from it.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
