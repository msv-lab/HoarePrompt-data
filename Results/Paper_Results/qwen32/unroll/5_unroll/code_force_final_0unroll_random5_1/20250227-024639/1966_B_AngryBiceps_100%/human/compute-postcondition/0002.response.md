Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a grid, and a grid represented by a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, consisting only of the characters 'W' and 'B'. The function returns a result based on the grid for each test case.**
