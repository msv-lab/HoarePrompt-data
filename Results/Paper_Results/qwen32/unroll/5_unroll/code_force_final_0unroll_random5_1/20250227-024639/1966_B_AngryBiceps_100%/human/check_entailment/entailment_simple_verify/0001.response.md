Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided solution to ensure the correctness of the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color using the specified operation. The operation allows us to select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Color Rows and Columns**:
   - If the first and last rows are both single-colored and have different colors, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color.
   - Similarly, if the first and last columns are both single-colored and have different colors, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color.

2. **General Case**:
   - If the grid does not meet the above condition, it is possible to make the entire grid the same color by expanding single-colored regions using the operation.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution checks:
- If the first and last rows are both single-colored and have different colors, it prints "NO".
- If the first and last columns are both single-colored and have different colors, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Correctness of the Solution:
Let's use the annotated code to validate the solution:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `a` is a list that stores the rows of the grid.
   - `first_row` is a string that stores the first character of each row.
   - `last_row` is a string that stores the last character of each row.

2. **First Condition Check**:
   - `len(set(a[0])) == 1`: Checks if the first row is single-colored.
   - `len(set(a[-1])) == 1`: Checks if the last row is single-colored.
   - `a[0] != a[-1]`: Checks if the first and last rows have different colors.
   - If all these conditions are true, it prints "NO".

3. **Second Condition Check**:
   - `len(set(first_row)) == 1`: Checks if the first column is single-colored.
   - `len(set(last_row)) == 1`: Checks if the last column is single-colored.
   - `first_row != last_row`: Checks if the first and last columns have different colors.
   - If all these conditions are true, it prints "NO".

4. **Else Case**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "YES".

### Testing the Solution:
Let's test the solution with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `2 1 \n W \n B`
   - Grid: `['W', 'B']`
   - First row: `W`, Last row: `B`
   - First column: `WB`, Last column: `WB`
   - First row and last row are single-colored and different, so it prints "NO".

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `6 6 \n WWWWBW \n WBWWWW \n BBBWWW \n BWWWBB \n WWBWBB \n BBBWBW`
   - Grid: `['WWWWBW', 'WBWWWW', 'BBBWWW', 'BWWWBB', 'WWBWBB', 'BBBWBW']`
   - First row: `WWWWBW`, Last row: `BBBWBW`
   - First column: `WBWBWB`, Last column: `WBWBWB`
   - Neither the first and last rows nor the first and last columns are both single-colored and different, so it prints "YES".

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `1 1 \n W`
   - Grid: `['W']`
   - First row: `W`, Last row: `W`
   - First column: `W`, Last column: `W`
   - All squares are already the same color, so it prints "YES".

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `2 2 \n BB \n BB`
   - Grid: `['BB', 'BB']`
   - First row: `BB`, Last row: `BB`
   - First column: `BB`, Last column: `BB`
   - All squares are already the same color, so it prints "YES".

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `3 4 \n BWBW \n WBWB \n BWBW`
   - Grid: `['BWBW', 'WBWB', 'BWBW']`
   - First row: `BWBW`, Last row: `BWBW`
   - First column: `BWB`, Last column: `BWB`
   - Neither the first and last rows nor the first and last columns are both single-colored and different, so it prints "YES".

6. **Example 6**:
   - Input: `4 2 \n BB \n BB \n WW \n WW`
   - Grid: `['BB', 'BB', 'WW', 'WW']`
   - First row: `BB`, Last row: `WW`
   - First column: `BWBW`, Last column: `BWBW`
   - First row and last row are single-colored and different, so it prints "NO".

7. **Example 7**:
   - Input: `4 4 \n WWBW \n BBWB \n WWBB \n BBBB`
   - Grid: `['WWBW', 'BBWB', 'WWBB', 'BBBB']`
   - First row: `WWBW`, Last row: `BBBB`
   - First column: `WBWB`, Last column: `WBWB`
   - Neither the first and last rows nor the first and last columns are both single-colored and different, so it prints "YES".

8. **Example 8**:
   - Input: `1 5 \n WBBWB`
   - Grid: `['WBBWB']`
   - First row: `WBBWB`, Last row: `WBBWB`
   - First column: `W`, Last column: `B`
   - First column and last column are single-colored and different, so it prints "NO".

### Conclusion:
The solution correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem description and the annotated code supports this. The provided solution correctly determines whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
