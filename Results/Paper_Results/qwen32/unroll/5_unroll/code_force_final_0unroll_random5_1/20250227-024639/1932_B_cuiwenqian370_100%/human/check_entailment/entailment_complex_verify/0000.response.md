### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to verify its correctness based on the problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.read` to get the entire input as a single string and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly parses the number of test cases `T` and then processes each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the `next_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
     - This formula ensures that the next sign occurs in the next multiple of `a[i]` after `last_year + 1`.
     - Let's break down the formula:
       - `last_year + 1`: This ensures we start checking from the year right after the previous sign occurred.
       - `+ a[i] - 1`: This ensures we are considering the next multiple of `a[i]` after `last_year + 1`.
       - `// a[i] * a[i]`: This operation finds the next multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the `last_year` (which is the year the n-th sign occurs) to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints all results separated by newlines.

### Validation with Annotations:

The annotations provided describe the state of the program at key points. Let's validate the annotations against the logic of the program:

- **State Right Before Function Call:**
  - The function `func_1` is called without arguments. The input is provided via standard input and consists of multiple test cases.
  - The annotations correctly describe the input format and the initial state of the program.

- **State During Processing:**
  - The annotations correctly describe the parsing of the input and the initialization of variables.
  - The annotations also correctly describe the calculation of `next_year` for each sign and the updating of `last_year`.

- **Final State:**
  - The annotations correctly describe the final state of the program after processing all test cases and the output format.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen according to the problem description. The annotations provide a detailed and accurate description of the program's behavior at key points, which confirms the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
