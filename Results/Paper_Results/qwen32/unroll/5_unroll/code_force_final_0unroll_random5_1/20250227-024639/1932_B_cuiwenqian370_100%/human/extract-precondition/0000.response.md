Precondition: **The function `func_1` takes no arguments. The input is provided via standard input and consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) is given in the first line of the input.**
