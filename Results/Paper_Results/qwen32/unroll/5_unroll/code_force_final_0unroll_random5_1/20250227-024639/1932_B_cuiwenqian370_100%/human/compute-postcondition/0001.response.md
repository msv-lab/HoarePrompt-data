The code snippet `data = input().split()` reads the entire input string and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This means that each integer in the input (including the number of test cases and the periodicities of the signs) will be a separate element in the list `data`.

Given the initial state, the input string `input` contains multiple test cases, where each test case starts with an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the periodicities. After executing the code snippet, the `data` list will contain all these integers as strings.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a number from the input. The input string `input` holds the entire input as provided.**
