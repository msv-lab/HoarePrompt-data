The provided code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` reads the entire input from standard input and assigns it to the variable `input`. This action does not change the initial state of the function `func_1` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. The only change is that the variable `input` now holds the entire input string.

Output State: **The function `func_1` takes no arguments; the input is provided via standard input and consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) is given in the first line of the input; `input` holds the entire input string.**
