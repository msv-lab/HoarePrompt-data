To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if it correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the provided problem description and the annotations.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly parses the number of test cases `T` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the `next_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. This formula ensures that the next sign occurs in the next multiple of `a[i]` after `last_year + 1`.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the `last_year` (which is the year the n-th sign occurs) to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints all results separated by newlines.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The function `func_1` takes no arguments. The input is provided via standard input and consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` and is followed by a line containing `n` integers representing the periodicities of the signs.
  
- **State during processing:**
  - The annotations show that `data` remains `["3", "2", "1", "2", "3", "2", "5"]`, which is consistent with the input being read correctly.
  - `index` is `7` after processing all test cases, indicating that all input data has been correctly parsed.
  - `T` remains `3`, indicating that the number of test cases is correctly identified.
  - `results` is `["2", "5", "5"]`, which matches the expected output for the given input.

### Edge Cases and Examples:

- **Single Sign:**
  - If there is only one sign, the program simply returns the first sign's periodicity, which is correct.
  
- **Same Periodicity for All Signs:**
  - If all signs have the same periodicity, the program correctly calculates the year based on the sequence, as shown in the annotations.
  
- **Different Periodicities:**
  - If signs have different periodicities, the program correctly waits for the next occurrence of each sign after the previous one, as demonstrated in the example provided.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the described scenarios and edge cases. The annotations confirm that the program's state and output match the expected results for the given input.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
