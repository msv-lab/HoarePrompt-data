Postcondition: **`obj` is a list containing two integers representing the coordinates (row, column) of an entity on the field. If `d` is 'L', the column coordinate has been decremented by 1. If `d` is 'R', the column coordinate has been incremented by 1. If `d` is neither 'L' nor 'R', the coordinates in `obj` remain unchanged.**
