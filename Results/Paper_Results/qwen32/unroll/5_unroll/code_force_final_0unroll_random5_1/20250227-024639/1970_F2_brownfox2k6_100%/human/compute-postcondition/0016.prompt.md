You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: obj is a list containing two integers representing the coordinates (row, column) of an entity on the field, and d is a string representing the direction of movement ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R').
def func_1(obj, d):
    if (d == 'U') :
        obj[0] -= 1
    else :
        if (d == 'D') :
            obj[0] += 1
        else :
            if (d == 'L') :
                obj[1] -= 1
            else :
                if (d == 'R') :
                    obj[1] += 1
                #State: `obj` is a list containing two integers representing the coordinates (row, column) of an entity on the field. If `d` is 'R', the column value in `obj` has been incremented by 1. If `d` is not 'R', the coordinates in `obj` remain unchanged.
            #State: `obj` is a list containing two integers representing the coordinates (row, column) of an entity on the field. If `d` is 'L', the column coordinate has been decremented by 1. If `d` is 'R', the column coordinate has been incremented by 1. If `d` is neither 'L' nor 'R', the coordinates in `obj` remain unchanged.
        #State: `obj` is a list containing two integers representing the coordinates (row, column) of an entity on the field. If `d` is 'D', the row coordinate has been incremented by 1. If `d` is 'L', the column coordinate has been decremented by 1. If `d` is 'R', the column coordinate has been incremented by 1. If `d` is neither 'D', 'L', nor 'R', the coordinates in `obj` remain unchanged.
    #State: `obj` is a list containing two integers representing the coordinates (row, column) of an entity on the field. If `d` is 'U', the row coordinate is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'D', the row coordinate is incremented by 1. If `d` is 'L', the column coordinate is decremented by 1. If `d` is 'R', the column coordinate is incremented by 1. If `d` is neither 'U', 'D', 'L', nor 'R', the coordinates in `obj` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `obj`, which is a list containing two integers representing the coordinates (row, column) of an entity on the field, and a parameter `d`, which is a string representing the direction of movement ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). The function returns the new coordinates of the entity after moving in the specified direction.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
