Output State: **obj is a list containing two integers representing the coordinates (row, column) of an entity on the field, where the column coordinate has been decremented by 1, and d is a string representing the direction of movement ('L').**

Natural language: The column coordinate of the entity's position in `obj` has been decreased by 1, while the row coordinate remains unchanged. The direction `d` is still 'L'.
