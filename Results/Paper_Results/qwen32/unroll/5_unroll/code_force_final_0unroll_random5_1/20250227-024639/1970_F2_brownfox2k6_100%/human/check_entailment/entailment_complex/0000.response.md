### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program correctly initializes the positions of the goals (`rg` and `bg`), the Quaffle (`ball`), the Bludger (`blud`), and all players (`player`).
   - It reads the input field and updates these variables accordingly.

2. **Game Simulation**:
   - The program iterates over each step (action) and processes it.
   - For each action, it checks the type of action (catching a ball `C`, throwing the Quaffle `T`, or moving `U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).
   - The function `func_1` is used to update the position of the entity based on the direction of movement.
   - The function `func_2` is used to check if any player is at the same position as the Bludger and eliminates them if so.

3. **Scoring and Elimination**:
   - When a player throws the Quaffle (`T`), the program checks if the Quaffle is in a goal.
   - If the Quaffle is in a goal of the opposing team, the team scores a point.
   - If the Quaffle is in a goal of the same team, the opposing team scores a point.
   - The Quaffle is then reset to the middle of the field.
   - Players are eliminated if they are at the same position as the Bludger, and this is printed in the required format.

4. **Final Output**:
   - After processing all actions, the program prints the final score in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly simulates the game according to the provided rules and outputs the correct events and final score.

**Correctness: True**
