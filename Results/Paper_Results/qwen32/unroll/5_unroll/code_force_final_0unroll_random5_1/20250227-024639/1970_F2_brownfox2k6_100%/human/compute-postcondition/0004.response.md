To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's break down the given loop and the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `t`: A non-negative integer representing the current time step.
- `player`: A dictionary where keys are player identifiers (strings) and values are lists of two integers representing their positions on the field. Players who were at the same position as the Bludger have their position updated to `[-1, -1]`.
- `blud`: A list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field.
- `out`: A list containing the identifiers of players who were at the same position as the Bludger.

### Loop Code:
```python
for p in sorted(out):
    print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the `out` list, which contains the identifiers of players who were at the same position as the Bludger.
- For each player identifier `p` in the sorted `out` list, the loop prints the current time step `t`, the player identifier `p`, and the string 'ELIMINATED'.

### Output State:
- The loop does not modify the values of `t`, `player`, `blud`, or `out`. It only prints information.
- The `out` list and its contents remain unchanged.
- The `player` dictionary remains unchanged except for the positions of players who were at the same position as the Bludger, which were already updated to `[-1, -1]` before the loop started.
- The `blud` list remains unchanged.
- The `t` value remains unchanged.

### Output State in Specified Format:
Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary where keys are player identifiers (strings) and values are lists of two integers representing their positions on the field, with any player who was at the same position as the Bludger having their position updated to `[-1, -1]`, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, and `out` is a list containing the identifiers of players who were at the same position as the Bludger.**
