Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not account for the robot's ability to move both vertically and horizontally in each second. It only considers the movement along the arrows and does not simulate the two-step movement (first a free move, then following the arrow) for each second.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:
```
Input:
1
4
><><
><><

Expected Output:
YES

Actual Output:
NO
```

In this example, the robot can follow a path like this:
1. Start at (1, 1).
2. Move right to (1, 2) and follow the arrow to (2, 2).
3. Move right to (2, 3) and follow the arrow to (1, 3).
4. Move right to (1, 4) and follow the arrow to (2, 4).

Thus, the robot can reach (2, 4), and the correct output should be "YES". However, the provided program will output "NO" because it does not correctly simulate the robot's movements according to the problem description.
