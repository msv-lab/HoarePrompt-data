Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) in a 2xN grid based on the direction of arrows in each cell. The robot can move left, right, down, or up (but not outside the grid) and then must follow the arrow in the cell it lands on.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. It initializes two boolean variables, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`, to track whether the robot can reach the end of the first row and the second row, respectively.
2. It iterates through each column `j` of the grid:
   - If the robot can reach the first row (`reachable_first_row` is True):
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
       - If it's the last column (`j == n - 1`), it means the robot can reach the end of the second row (`reachable_second_row` is set to True).
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
       - The robot can no longer reach the first row (`reachable_first_row` is set to False).
       - If it's not the last column and the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), the robot can reach the second row (`reachable_second_row` is set to True).
   - If the robot can reach the second row (`reachable_second_row` is True):
     - If the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
       - If it's the last column (`j == n - 1`), it means the robot can reach the end of the second row (`reachable_second_row` remains True).

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by following the arrows in the grid. It checks the conditions for reaching the end of the second row and correctly updates the boolean variables based on the direction of the arrows.

Correctness: **True**
