To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `test_case` and `test_cases`. The loop will iterate over each element in `test_cases`, so we need to ensure that `test_cases` is not empty and contains the appropriate elements.

Given the problem description, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. 

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **`test_cases`**: This must be a list with at least one tuple. Each tuple should have the form `(n, string1, string2)` where `n` is an even integer and `string1` and `string2` are strings of length `n` containing only '<' and '>'.

2. **`test_case`**: This variable represents the current element in the iteration. It will be a tuple of the form `(n, string1, string2)`.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This indicates that there are `t` test cases, so `test_cases` should have `t` elements.

### Adjusted State:

To ensure the loop executes, `test_cases` must contain `t` elements, each of which is a tuple with the specified properties. The variable `test_case` does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts because it will be assigned by the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples where each tuple is of the form `(n, string1, string2)` with `n` being an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `string1` and `string2` being strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and/or '>', `results` is an empty list**.
