You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

    return results
    #The program returns a list of strings, each being either 'YES' or 'NO', corresponding to whether the second row is reachable from the first row for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `test_cases` of tuples. Each tuple contains an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and/or '>'. It returns a list of strings, each being either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the second string in each tuple is reachable from the first string based on specific movement rules for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (number of columns in the grid).
   - It then reads two strings of length `n`, representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid.
   - These inputs are stored in a list of tuples `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - It initializes two boolean variables: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`.
     - `reachable_first_row` is initially set to `True` because the robot starts at (1, 1).
     - `reachable_second_row` is initially set to `False` because the robot cannot start at (2, 1).
   - The program iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If `reachable_first_row` is `True`:
       - If the arrow at `row1[j]` points right (`'>'`):
         - If `j` is the last column (`n-1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can potentially move to (2, n).
       - If the arrow at `row1[j]` points left (`'<'`):
         - It sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` because the robot cannot move further left in the first row.
         - If the arrow at `row2[j]` points right (`'>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can move from (1, j) to (2, j) and then move right.
     - If `reachable_second_row` is `True`:
       - If the arrow at `row2[j]` points right (`'>'`):
         - If `j` is the last column (`n-1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (though this line is redundant since `reachable_second_row` is already `True`).
   - After processing all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the robot can reach (2, n).

**Correctness Analysis:**
- The program does not correctly handle all scenarios. Specifically, it does not correctly manage the transitions between rows based on the arrows' directions and the robot's movements.
- For example, the program incorrectly assumes that if the robot is in the first row and the arrow points left, it cannot move further left, which is not necessarily true because the robot can move up to the second row first and then move left.
- Additionally, the program does not consider the possibility of moving up or down in the grid, which is crucial for reaching the target cell (2, n).

**Conclusion:**
The given program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **False**
