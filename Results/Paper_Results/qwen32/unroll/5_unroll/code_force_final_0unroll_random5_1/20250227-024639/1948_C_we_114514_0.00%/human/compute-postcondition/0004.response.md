Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list `test_cases` containing `t` tuples. Each tuple consists of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` composed of the characters '<' and/or '>'. The function returns a list of strings, each being either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the second string in each tuple is reachable from the first string based on the given rules for each test case.**
