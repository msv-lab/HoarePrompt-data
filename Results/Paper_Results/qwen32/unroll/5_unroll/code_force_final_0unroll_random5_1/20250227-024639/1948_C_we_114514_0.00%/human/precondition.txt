t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple (n, row1, row2) where n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and row1 and row2 are strings of length n consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
