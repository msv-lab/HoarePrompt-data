To determine the output state after the loop finishes, we need to analyze the given loop and the initial state:

- The loop runs `test_cases` number of times, where `test_cases` is the return value of `func_1()`.
- In each iteration of the loop, `func_6()` is called.

Since the problem does not provide the definitions of `func_1()` and `func_6()`, we can only infer the state based on the information provided. `test_cases` will remain unchanged as it is used to control the loop iterations and is not modified within the loop. The function `func_6()` is called in each iteration, but its effect on the state is not specified, so we can't determine any changes it might make to other variables.

Given the constraints, the only thing we can definitively say is that the loop will execute `test_cases` times, and `test_cases` will still hold the same value after the loop finishes.

Output State: **`test_cases` holds the same return value of `func_1()` as in the initial state.**
