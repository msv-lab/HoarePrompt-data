The code snippet changes the color of the vertex `curr` from 1 to 2. The values of `curr`, `parent`, and `path` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex in the DFS traversal, and `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the traversal with `curr` appended to it. The color of the vertex `curr` is 2.**
