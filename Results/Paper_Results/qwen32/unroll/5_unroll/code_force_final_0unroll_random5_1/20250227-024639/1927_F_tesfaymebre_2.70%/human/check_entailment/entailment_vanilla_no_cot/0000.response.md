Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect due to several issues:

1. **Graph and DSU Scope**: The `graph` dictionary and `node_v` variable used in the `dfs` function are not defined within its scope. They are local to the `func_6` function. To fix this, `graph` and `node_v` should be passed as arguments to the `dfs` function.

2. **Cycle Detection Logic**: The logic for detecting the cycle and returning it is flawed. The DFS function should return the cycle once it finds that it revisits a node that is part of the current path (not just any node). The current implementation may not correctly identify the cycle.

3. **DSU Implementation**: The `DSU` (Disjoint Set Union) class is not defined in the provided code. The `DSU` class should have methods like `find`, `union`, and possibly `min_edge` to manage the union-find structure and keep track of the minimum edge weights.

4. **Edge Sorting**: The edges are sorted in reverse order, which is contrary to the requirement to find the cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge. The edges should be sorted in ascending order of their weights.

5. **Cycle Extraction**: The cycle extraction logic in the DFS function is incomplete. It should correctly identify the cycle and return it in the correct order.

6. **Output Format**: The output format should be strictly followed. The program should print the minimum weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

These issues need to be addressed for the program to be correct.
