To determine what will be printed by the `print(*res)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context of the variables involved.

### Key Points from the Initial State:
1. **`graph`**: A `defaultdict` of lists, implying it is a graph represented in an adjacency list format.
2. **`edges`**: A list of tuples sorted in descending order based on weight. Each tuple likely represents an edge in the graph with a weight.
3. **`dsu`**: An instance of the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) class, which is used to manage connected components in the graph.
4. **`n` and `m`**: These are likely the number of nodes and edges in the graph, respectively. They remain unchanged.
5. **`_min_edge`**: The weight of the smallest edge in the last updated component.
6. **`node_u` and `node_v`**: The nodes of that smallest edge.
7. **`colors`**: A list of `n + 1` zeros, which could be used for marking nodes in some traversal.
8. **`res`**: The result of the `dfs` (Depth-First Search) function executed with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list.

### Understanding `res`:
- The variable `res` is the result of a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from `node_u` with a parent node of `-1` and an initial empty list.
- The DFS function likely collects some information about the nodes it visits, which is stored in `res`.

### Output Analysis:
- The `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of the list `res` separated by spaces.
- Since `res` is the result of the DFS function, it will contain the nodes visited by the DFS starting from `node_u`.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the nodes visited by the DFS starting from `node_u`, printed in the order they were visited.

### Final Output:
Output: **node_u [nodes visited in DFS order starting from node_u] (where node_u is the starting node of the DFS and the nodes are the elements of the list `res`)**

To make it more precise, if we assume that the DFS function simply collects the nodes it visits, the output will be the nodes in the order they were visited starting from `node_u`.

If we don't have the exact nodes visited, we can describe it as follows:

Output: **node_u [nodes visited in DFS order starting from node_u] (where node_u is the starting node of the DFS and the nodes are the elements of the list `res`)**

If we had specific nodes visited, we could list them explicitly. Since we don't have that information, the above description is the most precise we can provide based on the given initial state.
