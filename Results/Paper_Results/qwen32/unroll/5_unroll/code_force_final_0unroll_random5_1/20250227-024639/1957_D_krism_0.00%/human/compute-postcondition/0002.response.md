The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into a list of substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `arr`. This means that `arr` will now hold the list of integers provided in the input.

Given the initial state, `n` is the number of integers in the input list, and `a` is a list of `n` integers. After executing the given code, `arr` will be assigned the list of integers from the input, and `a` will no longer be relevant in the context of the current state since `arr` now holds the same list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
