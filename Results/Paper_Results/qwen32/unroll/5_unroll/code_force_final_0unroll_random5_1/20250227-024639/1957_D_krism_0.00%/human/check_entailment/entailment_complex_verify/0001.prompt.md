You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, computes a series of cumulative XOR results, and then calculates a specific sum based on the counts of 0s and 1s in the binary representation of these XOR results. It prints the original list, the list of cumulative XOR results, two lists (`pre` and `suf`) that contain counts of 0s and 1s for each bit position, and finally, the computed sum for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements
The goal is to count the number of tuples (x, y, z) such that:
1. 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ n
2. f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z)

Where f(l, r) is the XOR of all elements from index l to r in the array.

### Program Analysis
The provided program is attempting to solve the problem using a prefix XOR array and some bit manipulation, but it seems to have several issues:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The prefix XOR array `prefix` is correctly calculated. `prefix[i]` holds the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the (i-1)th element.

2. **Pre and Suf Arrays**:
   - `pre` and `suf` are initialized to count the number of elements with a 0 or 1 in each bit position from 0 to 31.
   - However, the logic for updating these arrays and using them to count valid tuples is incorrect.

3. **Bitwise Logic**:
   - The program attempts to use the most significant bit of `y` (denoted by `k`) to determine the contribution of the current prefix and suffix counts to the answer.
   - The update logic for `pre` and `suf` arrays is incorrect. The arrays are supposed to keep track of the count of numbers with a 0 or 1 in each bit position as we iterate through the array.

4. **Counting Valid Tuples**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the number of valid tuples using the `pre` and `suf` arrays.
   - It does not correctly account for the condition `f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z)`.

### Example Analysis
Let's take the first test case from the example:
```
3
3
6 2 4
```
The correct output is 4, but the provided program will not produce this output due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid tuples based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
