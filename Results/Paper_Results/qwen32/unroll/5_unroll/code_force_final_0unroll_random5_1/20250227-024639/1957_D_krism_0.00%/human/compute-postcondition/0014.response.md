To determine the output of the `print(suf)` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. **`t`** and **`n`** remain unchanged.
2. **`arr`** remains unchanged.
3. **`prefix`** remains unchanged.
4. **`pre`** is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[1, 0]`.
5. **`suf`** is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[count of 0s, count of 1s]` for the corresponding bit position across `prefix[1]` to `prefix[n]`.

The key piece of information here is the definition of the `suf` list. Each sublist in `suf` contains two elements:
- The first element is the count of 0s.
- The second element is the count of 1s.

However, the exact values of these counts are dependent on the values in the `prefix` list, which is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can't determine the exact numerical values of the counts of 0s and 1s for each bit position across `prefix[1]` to `prefix[n]`.

Given this, the output of `print(suf)` will be a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist contains two counts (of 0s and 1s) for the corresponding bit position across `prefix[1]` to `prefix[n]`.

Output: **suf (where suf is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [count of 0s, count of 1s] for the corresponding bit position across prefix[1] to prefix[n])**
