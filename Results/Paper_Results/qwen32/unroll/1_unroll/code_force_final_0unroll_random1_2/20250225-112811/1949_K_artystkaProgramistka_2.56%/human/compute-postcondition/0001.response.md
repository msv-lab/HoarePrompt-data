The given code snippet initializes three empty lists: `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. None of the other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 200,000, `na`, `nb`, `nc` are positive integers such that 1 <= `na`, `nb`, `nc` <= `n`-2, and `na` + `nb` + `nc` = `n`. `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 10^9. `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c` are empty lists.**
