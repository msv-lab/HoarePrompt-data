Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n` (a positive integer between 3 and 200,000), `na` (a positive integer between 1 and `n-2`), `nb` (a positive integer between 1 and `n-2`), `nc` (a positive integer between 1 and `n-2`), and `numbers` (a list of `n` positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9). The sum of `na`, `nb`, and `nc` equals `n`. The function returns 'YES' along with three groups: `group_a` containing the `na` largest numbers from `numbers`, `group_b` containing the next `nb` largest numbers, and `group_c` containing the remaining `nc` numbers. If it is not possible to form such groups, the function returns 'NO'.**
