Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers and an even integer. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to select exactly half of the integer `k` from each list such that the selected integers are common or unique to each list, and outputs "yes" if possible, otherwise "no".**
