Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m`, an even integer `k`, and two lists `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. Each integer in `a` and `b` is within a specified range. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided inputs, but the specific output details are not provided in the description.**
