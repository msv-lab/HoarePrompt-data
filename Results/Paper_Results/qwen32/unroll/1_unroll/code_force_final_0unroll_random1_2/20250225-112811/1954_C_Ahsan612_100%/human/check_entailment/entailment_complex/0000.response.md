### Reasoning:
The given program is designed to maximize the product of two numbers `x` and `y` by swapping their digits at each position. The strategy outlined in the program is to:
1. Traverse the digits of `x` and `y` from left to right.
2. For each position, if the digits are the same, choose the maximum digit for the first number and the minimum digit for the second number (which will be the same in this case).
3. At the first position where the digits differ, choose the maximum digit for the first number and the minimum digit for the second number.
4. For all subsequent positions, choose the minimum digit for the first number and the maximum digit for the second number.

This strategy ensures that the numbers are as large as possible while maintaining the constraint of swapping digits at the same positions. The provided example outputs match this strategy:
- For the input `73` and `31`, the output is `71` and `33`.
- For the input `2` and `5`, the output is `5` and `2`.
- For the input `3516` and `3982`, the output is `3912` and `3586`.

The program correctly implements this logic and the example outputs verify that the strategy works as intended.
