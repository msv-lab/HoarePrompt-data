The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length containing only '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it determines if there exists any pair of consecutive positions in the strings where both strings have '<' characters in a specific pattern, and prints 'No' if such a pattern is found; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.
