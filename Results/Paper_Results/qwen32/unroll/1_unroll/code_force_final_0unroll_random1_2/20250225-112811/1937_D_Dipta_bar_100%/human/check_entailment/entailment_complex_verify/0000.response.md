To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description, the program code, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code systematically.

### Problem Description Recap
- We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with each cell containing either `<` or `>`.
- A pinball placed on a cell moves according to the direction of the character in that cell.
- After each move, the character in the cell is inverted.
- The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.
- For each of the `n` cells, we need to determine how many seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid if initially placed on that cell.

### Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1(s)`
1. **Initialization**:
   - `A` and `idx_A` are initialized to keep track of cumulative values and indices of `>` characters.
   - `B` and `idx_B` are initialized similarly but for `<` characters.

2. **Processing `>` Characters**:
   - For each `>` character, calculate a cumulative value based on the distance to the previous `>` character and the number of `>` characters encountered so far.
   - Store the index of each `>` character in `idx_A`.

3. **Processing `<` Characters**:
   - For each `<` character (starting from the end of the string), calculate a cumulative value based on the distance to the next `<` character and the number of `<` characters encountered so far.
   - Store the index of each `<` character in `idx_B`.

4. **Calculating Output**:
   - Use the cumulative values `A` and `B` to calculate the number of steps for each cell.
   - The logic involves adjusting cumulative values based on the current position and the positions of `>` and `<` characters.

### Annotations
The annotations provide insights into the state of the program at various points:
- After processing `>`, `A` and `idx_A` are correctly populated.
- After processing `<`, `B` and `idx_B` are correctly populated.
- The final loop calculates the number of steps for each cell using the precomputed values.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect due to:
1. Function definition and usage.
2. Logic for pinball movement.
3. Edge cases.
4. Output formatting.

### Detailed Evaluation

#### Function Definition and Usage
- The function `func_1(s)` is correctly defined and used. It processes the string `s` and prints the results directly.
- The main loop correctly handles multiple test cases and calls `func_1(s)` for each test case.

#### Logic for Pinball Movement
- The logic within `func_1(s)` is complex but appears to be correct based on the annotations.
- The cumulative values `A` and `B` are correctly computed and used to determine the number of steps for each cell.

#### Edge Cases
- The code handles various edge cases, including grids with all `<` or all `>`, and grids where the pinball immediately leaves the grid.
- The cumulative values and indices are correctly updated for these scenarios.

#### Output Formatting
- The code uses `print()` statements to output the results for each test case.
- The output format matches the problem description.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct. The logic for calculating the number of steps for each pinball is sound, and the program handles various edge cases correctly. The output format is also as required.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
