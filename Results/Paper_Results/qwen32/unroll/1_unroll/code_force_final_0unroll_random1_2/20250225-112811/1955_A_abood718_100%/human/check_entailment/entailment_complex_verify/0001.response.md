### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure that the logic and implementation are correct based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Goal:** Determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- **Cost Conditions:**
  - Buying one yogurt costs `a` burles.
  - Buying two yogurts in a promotion costs `b` burles.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts in promotion).

2. **Logic Implementation:**
   - **Case 1:** If buying two yogurts at regular price (2*a) is cheaper than the promotion price (b), then buy all yogurts individually.
     - Condition: `B * 2 < C` (where `B` is `a` and `C` is `b`).
     - Action: `print(A * B)` (where `A` is `n` and `B` is `a`).
   - **Case 2:** If the promotion price is cheaper or equal to the regular price for two yogurts:
     - **Subcase 2.1:** If `n` is even, buy all yogurts in pairs.
       - Condition: `A % 2 == 0` (where `A` is `n`).
       - Action: `print(int(A * C / 2))` (where `C` is `b`).
     - **Subcase 2.2:** If `n` is odd, buy `(n-1)` yogurts in pairs and the last one individually.
       - Action: `X = A // 2` (where `X` is the number of pairs).
       - Action: `print(X * C + B)` (where `C` is `b` and `B` is `a`).

#### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
  - Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.

- **Annotations:**
  - The annotations correctly map the input values to `A`, `B`, and `C`.
  - The conditions and actions in the code are consistent with the logic described in the problem analysis.

#### Testing with Example Inputs:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `2 5 9`
  - Calculation: Since `5 * 2 < 9` is false, and `2` is even, cost = `(2 / 2) * 9 = 9`.
  - Output: `9` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `3 5 9`
  - Calculation: Since `5 * 2 < 9` is false, and `3` is odd, cost = `(3 // 2) * 9 + 5 = 14`.
  - Output: `14` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `3 5 11`
  - Calculation: Since `5 * 2 < 11` is false, and `3` is odd, cost = `(3 // 2) * 11 + 5 = 15`.
  - Output: `15` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `4 5 11`
  - Calculation: Since `5 * 2 < 11` is false, and `4` is even, cost = `(4 / 2) * 11 = 20`.
  - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts based on the given conditions. The annotations and the logic in the code align with the problem description.

**Final: True**
