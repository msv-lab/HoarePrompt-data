Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- **Objective:** Determine the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.
- **Pricing:**
  - Single yogurt: `a` burles
  - Two yogurts (promotion): `b` burles
- **Constraints:**
  - `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` (number of test cases)
  - `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` (number of yogurts)
  - `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30` (prices)

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then determines the minimum cost based on the following logic:

1. **Condition 1:**
   - `if B * 2 < C`
   - **Explanation:** If the price of two yogurts bought individually is less than the promotion price, then it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually.
   - **Action:** `print(A * B)`

2. **Condition 2:**
   - `elif A % 2 == 0`
   - **Explanation:** If the number of yogurts is even, then it's optimal to buy all yogurts in pairs.
   - **Action:** `print(int(A * C / 2))`

3. **Else Condition:**
   - **Explanation:** If the number of yogurts is odd, then buy as many pairs as possible and buy the remaining yogurt individually.
   - **Action:** `X = A // 2` (number of pairs)
             `print(X * C + B)` (cost of pairs + cost of the remaining yogurt)

### Evaluation:
- **Condition 1:** Correctly checks if buying individually is cheaper.
- **Condition 2:** Correctly handles the case when the number of yogurts is even.
- **Else Condition:** Correctly handles the case when the number of yogurts is odd by buying as many pairs as possible and then buying the remaining yogurt individually.

### Testing Against Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1:** `2 5 9`
   - Buy 2 yogurts in a pair: `9` burles.

2. **Test Case 2:** `3 5 9`
   - Buy 2 yogurts in a pair and 1 yogurt individually: `9 + 5 = 14` burles.

3. **Test Case 3:** `3 5 11`
   - Buy 2 yogurts in a pair and 1 yogurt individually: `11 + 5 = 16` burles.
   - However, buying 3 yogurts individually is cheaper: `3 * 5 = 15` burles.
   - The program correctly handles this case by checking if `B * 2 < C` first.

4. **Test Case 4:** `4 5 11`
   - Buy 2 pairs of yogurts: `2 * 11 = 22` burles.
   - However, buying 4 yogurts individually is cheaper: `4 * 5 = 20` burles.
   - The program correctly handles this case by checking if `B * 2 < C` first.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts based on the given prices. It handles all edge cases and conditions as specified in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
