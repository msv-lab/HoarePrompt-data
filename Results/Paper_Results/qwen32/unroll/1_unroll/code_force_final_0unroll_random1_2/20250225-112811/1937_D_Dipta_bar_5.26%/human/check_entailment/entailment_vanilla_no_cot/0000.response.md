Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query. The logic in the `func_1` function is overly complex and does not accurately simulate the described behavior of the pinball moving and inverting the grid cells. 

Here are a few issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Simulation of Pinball Movement**: The program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball and the inversion of the grid cells. The logic to calculate the number of steps is incorrect and does not account for the changing direction of the pinball as it inverts the cells.

2. **Inefficient Handling of Queries**: The program attempts to handle multiple queries by using complex data structures and calculations, which are not necessary for the problem. A more straightforward simulation of the pinball movement for each cell would suffice.

3. **Output Formatting**: The print statements in the program do not correctly format the output for each test case. The output should be separated by spaces and each test case should be on a new line.

A correct approach would involve simulating the movement of the pinball for each starting position and keeping track of the number of steps taken until the pinball leaves the grid. This can be done using a simple loop for each starting position and updating the grid as the pinball moves.

Here is a simplified and correct version of the program:

```python
def simulate_pinball(n, s, start):
    steps = 0
    pos = start
    grid = list(s)
    while 0 <= pos < n:
        if grid[pos] == '<':
            next_pos = pos - 1
        else:
            next_pos = pos + 1
        grid[pos] = '>' if grid[pos] == '<' else '<'
        pos = next_pos
        steps += 1
    return steps

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    results = []
    for i in range(n):
        results.append(simulate_pinball(n, s, i))
    print(' '.join(map(str, results)))
```

This simplified version simulates the pinball movement for each starting position and correctly calculates the number of steps until the pinball leaves the grid.
