The code assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a string of length `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5`), the value of `n` will be the length of `s`. The other variable `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of `s`.**
