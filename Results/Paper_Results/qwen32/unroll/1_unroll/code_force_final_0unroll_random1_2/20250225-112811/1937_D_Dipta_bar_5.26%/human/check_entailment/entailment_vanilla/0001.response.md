The provided program attempts to solve the problem by using two arrays `A` and `B` to keep track of the accumulated movements of the pinball when it encounters '>' and '<' characters, respectively, from left to right and right to left. However, there are several issues and inconsistencies in the logic that make the program incorrect.

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Pinball Movement:**
   - The logic for calculating the number of steps `a` and `b` is overly complex and does not correctly reflect the pinball movement rules. Specifically, the expressions like `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` and `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` do not accurately represent the number of steps it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The program does not correctly account for the inversion of the characters after the pinball moves, which affects subsequent movements.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the pinball starts on the boundary of the grid correctly. For example, if the pinball starts on the first cell and the character is '<', or on the last cell and the character is '>', it should immediately leave the grid in one step, but the program does not handle this correctly.

3. **Incorrect Indexing and Length Calculations:**
   - The program uses `idx_A` and `idx_B` to store indices of '>' and '<' characters, respectively. However, the way these indices are used in the calculations is incorrect and can lead to out-of-bounds errors or incorrect results.

4. **Inconsistent Output:**
   - The program prints the results directly without storing them first, which can lead to incorrect outputs if the logic for calculating the steps is flawed.

Given these issues, the program is not correct and does not produce the expected results for all possible inputs.

**Correctness: False**
