The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it iterates over the range of `test_cases`. To ensure that the loop executes, `test_cases` must be at least 1. The variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are not directly part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `test_cases` <= 10^4, `i` is 0**
