The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters as per the provided function signature. However, based on the context provided, it seems to operate using global variables or variables defined in a broader scope, including `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, and `bipartite`.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal on a graph represented by disks (circles) defined by their centers (`x`, `y`) and radii (`r`). It uses the `visited` list to keep track of visited nodes, the `coef` list to store coefficients, and the `tot` and `bipartite` variables to maintain information about the total count and bipartiteness during the traversal. The function does not explicitly return any value but modifies the `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, and `bipartite` variables as part of its operation.**
