Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is the first integer from each line of input, `y` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is the second integer from each line of input, `r` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is the third integer from each line of input, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is True, `ok` is False.**

Explanation: The variable `ok` has been assigned the value `False`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
