Postcondition: **`visited` is a list of boolean values indicating which nodes have been visited, `coef` is a list of integers where each element is 1 if it was the starting point of a new component, `tot` is the final value after all DFS traversals, `bipartite` is the final value after all DFS traversals, and `ok` is a boolean indicating whether at least one bipartite component with a non-zero `tot` was found. If `ok` is True, at least one such component was found; otherwise, no such component was found.**
