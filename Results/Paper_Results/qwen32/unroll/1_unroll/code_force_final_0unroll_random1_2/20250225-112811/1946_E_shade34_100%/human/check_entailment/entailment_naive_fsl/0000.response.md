Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be related to modular arithmetic operations (likely inverse modulo calculations), but they do not address the problem of counting permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.

The problem requires analyzing the indices of prefix and suffix maximums to determine the number of valid permutations. The provided code does not contain any logic to handle the permutation logic or the constraints specified in the problem description.

To solve this problem, one would need to:
1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
2. For each test case, analyze the indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
3. Use combinatorial logic to count the number of permutations that satisfy the conditions.
4. Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Since the provided code does not implement any of this logic, it is incorrect.
