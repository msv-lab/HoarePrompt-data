To determine the output state, we need to carefully consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. Here's the breakdown:

- `a` and `b` are integers.
- `b` is not equal to 0.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
- `a` is not divisible by `b`.
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`.

The code snippet returns `d, c - a // b * d`.

Since `a` is not divisible by `b`, `a % b` will be some non-zero integer. The function `func_1(b, a % b)` is called with these parameters and returns two values, `c` and `d`.

Let's denote the return values of `func_1(b, a % b)` as `c` and `d`. The final return statement of the code is `d, c - a // b * d`.

Output State: **The program returns `d` and `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`.**
