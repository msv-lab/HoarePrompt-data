Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It returns a tuple based on the following conditions: Case_1: If `a` and `b` are such that the function's logic leads to this case, it returns the tuple (1, 0). Case_2: If the function's logic leads to this case, it returns the values `d` and `c` in that order, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`. Case_3: If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `b` is a non-zero integer that divides `a` without a remainder, it returns the tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)). Case_4: If the function's logic leads to this case, it returns `d` and `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`.**
