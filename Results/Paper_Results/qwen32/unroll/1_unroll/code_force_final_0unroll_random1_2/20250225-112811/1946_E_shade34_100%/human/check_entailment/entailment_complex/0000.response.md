### Reasoning:

The task is to determine the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximums. The program calculates this using combinatorial methods, particularly the binomial coefficient, which is computed using precomputed factorials and modular arithmetic.

1. **Factorial Precomputation:**
   - The program precomputes factorials up to `2 * 10^5` modulo `10^9 + 7` to efficiently compute binomial coefficients later.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - For each test case, the program reads `n`, `m1`, and `m2`, which represent the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.
   - It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

3. **Validation:**
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index matches the first suffix maximum index, and if the first prefix maximum is at index 1 and the last suffix maximum is at index `n`. If these conditions are not met, it outputs `0` because such a permutation is impossible.

4. **Combinatorial Calculation:**
   - If the conditions are met, the program proceeds to calculate the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods.
   - It uses the `func_2` function to compute the binomial coefficient modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose and arrange elements between the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It multiplies the results of these calculations, taking care to apply the modulo operation at each step to prevent overflow.

5. **Function Analysis:**
   - `func_1` implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to compute modular inverses, which is used in `func_2` to compute the binomial coefficient.
   - `func_2` computes `(a * b^-1) % 10^9 + 7` using the result of `func_1`.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of permutations with specified prefix and suffix maximums. It handles the combinatorial calculations efficiently using precomputed factorials and modular arithmetic. The validation step ensures that impossible configurations are correctly identified.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided input-output examples.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
