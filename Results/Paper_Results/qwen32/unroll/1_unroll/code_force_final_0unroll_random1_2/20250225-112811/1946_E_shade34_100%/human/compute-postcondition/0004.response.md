To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `func_1(b, a)` and how it affects the variables `c` and `d`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d` directly. However, we can still describe the output state in terms of the function's return values.

Given:
- `a` and `b` are integers.
- `b` is not equal to 0.
- `a` is less than `b`.

After executing the code `c, d = func_1(b, a)`, the variables `c` and `d` will be assigned the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`. The initial conditions about `a`, `b` remain valid unless explicitly changed by the function.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `b` is not equal to 0, `a` is less than `b`; `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`**.
