The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. Therefore, the values of `x` and `y` will be updated based on the input provided. The other variables `n`, `t`, the tree structure, and the starting node for the single round remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1) where 1 <= u_1 <= n, representing the starting node for the single round. `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input.**
