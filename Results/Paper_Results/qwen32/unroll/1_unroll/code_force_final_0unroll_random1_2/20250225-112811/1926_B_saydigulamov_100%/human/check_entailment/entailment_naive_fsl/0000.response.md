Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape drawn on the grid is a triangle or a square. The current implementation only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows are equal, which is not sufficient to determine the shape.

Here is a counterexample that demonstrates the issue:
```
Input:
1
3
010
111
010

Expected Output:
TRIANGLE

Actual Output:
SQUARE
```
In the above example, the grid contains a triangle, but the program incorrectly identifies it as a square because the number of '1's in the first and second rows are not equal.

The program needs to correctly identify the pattern of '1's in the grid for both triangles and squares, which involves checking the structure of the shape, not just the count of '1's in the first few rows.
