### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and then reads `n` lines of the grid.

2. **Processing Each Grid:**
   - For each grid, it initializes an empty list `k`.
   - It then iterates through each row `b` of the grid.
   - If the row contains '1's, it counts the number of '1's in that row and appends this count to the list `k`.

3. **Determine Shape:**
   - After processing all rows of a grid, it checks if the first two counts in `k` are equal.
   - If they are equal, it prints "SQUARE"; otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

### Issues:
- The logic to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle is flawed.
  - A square should have all rows with the same number of '1's.
  - A triangle (upside down or not) does not necessarily have the first two rows with the same number of '1's. For example, in a triangle with k=4, the number of '1's in each row would be 1, 3, 5, 7, which are not equal.
- The code does not correctly identify the pattern of '1's for a triangle.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle based on the provided problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
