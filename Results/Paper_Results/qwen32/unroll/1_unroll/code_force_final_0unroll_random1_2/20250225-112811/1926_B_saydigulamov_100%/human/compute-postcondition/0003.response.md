Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) and an `n x n` grid containing only the characters '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square made up of all the '1's, with the size of the shape (k) greater than 1. The function returns the type of shape ('triangle' or 'square') for each test case.**
