### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided code and compare it to the problem requirements.

The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads the grid itself. The program counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and stores these counts in a list `k`.

The program then checks if the first two elements of `k` are equal. If they are, it prints "SQUARE"; otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

However, this approach is flawed. The number of '1's in the first two rows of a triangle or a square does not necessarily indicate the shape. For example:
- A square of size `k` will have `k` '1's in each row.
- A triangle of size `k` will have `1`, `3`, `5`, ..., `2k-1` '1's in its rows, and an upside-down triangle will have `2k-1`, `2k-3`, ..., `1` '1's in its rows.

The program does not correctly identify the shape based on these counts. It only checks the first two counts, which is insufficient for determining the shape of the figure.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle based on the counts of '1's in the rows. Therefore, it is incorrect.
