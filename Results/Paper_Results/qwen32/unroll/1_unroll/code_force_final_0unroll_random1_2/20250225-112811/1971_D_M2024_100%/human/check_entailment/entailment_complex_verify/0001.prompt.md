You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        cut0 = 0
        
        cut1 = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)
        
    #State: The output state is determined by the last iteration's print statement, which is either `cut1 + 1` if `cut0` is 0, or `cut0 + cut1` otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of '0's and '1's. It then calculates and prints the number of transitions between '0' and '1' and between '1' and '0' in the string. If there are no '0' to '1' transitions, it adds 1 to the count of '1' to '0' transitions before printing the result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the minimum number of pieces a binary string can be cut into, such that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Key Observations:
1. **Sorted Binary String**: The final sorted string will have all '0's followed by all '1's.
2. **Transitions**: To achieve this, we need to identify the transitions from '1' to '0' and '0' to '1' in the string.
3. **Minimum Cuts**: The number of cuts needed is related to the number of transitions. Specifically:
   - A transition from '1' to '0' indicates that a cut is necessary to separate the '1's from the '0's.
   - A transition from '0' to '1' also indicates a cut, as this is where the '0's end and '1's begin.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no transitions ('000...' or '111...'), then only one piece is needed.
   - If there are transitions, the number of cuts required is the sum of the transitions plus one (to account for the initial segment).

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the provided program to see if it correctly implements the above logic.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Initialization**: `cut0` and `cut1` are initialized to zero. `cut0` counts transitions from '0' to '1', and `cut1` counts transitions from '1' to '0'.
2. **Transition Counting**: The program iterates through the string and increments `cut0` and `cut1` based on the transitions.
3. **Output Logic**:
   - If `cut0` is zero (no '0' to '1' transitions), it means the string starts with '0's and ends with '1's. In this case, the number of pieces needed is `cut1 + 1`.
   - If `cut0` is not zero, it means there are both '0' to '1' and '1' to '0' transitions. The number of pieces needed is the sum of `cut0` and `cut1`.

### Correctness Check:
- **Test Case 1**: "11010"
  - Transitions: '1' to '0' (cut1 = 2), '0' to '1' (cut0 = 1)
  - Output: `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 2 = 3` (Correct)
- **Test Case 2**: "00000000"
  - Transitions: None
  - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1` (Correct)
- **Test Case 3**: "1"
  - Transitions: None
  - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1` (Correct)
- **Test Case 4**: "10"
  - Transitions: '1' to '0' (cut1 = 1)
  - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)
- **Test Case 5**: "0001111"
  - Transitions: None
  - Output: `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1` (Correct)
- **Test Case 6**: "0110"
  - Transitions: '0' to '1' (cut0 = 1), '1' to '0' (cut1 = 1)
  - Output: `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly counts the necessary transitions and calculates the minimum number of pieces required for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
