The code snippet `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the integer input to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer between 1 and 500, and `s` is a string of '0's and '1's with a length between 1 and 500. Since the code only modifies `t` and does not affect `s`, the value of `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.**
