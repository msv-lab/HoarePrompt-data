Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of '0's and '1's. It then calculates and prints the number of transitions between '0' and '1' and between '1' and '0' in the string. If there are no '0' to '1' transitions, it adds 1 to the count of '1' to '0' transitions before printing the result.**
