### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine the minimum number of pieces required to cut a binary string so that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and execution:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes counters `cut0` and `cut1` to zero. These counters are meant to count the number of transitions from '0' to '1' (`cut0`) and from '1' to '0' (`cut1`), respectively.

2. **Transition Counting**: The program iterates through the string, checking each pair of adjacent characters:
   - If it finds a transition from '1' to '0', it increments `cut1`.
   - If it finds a transition from '0' to '1', it increments `cut0`.

3. **Determining the Number of Pieces**:
   - If there are no '0' to '1' transitions (`cut0 == 0`), the string can be rearranged into a sorted binary string with `cut1 + 1` pieces. This is because the string must end in '1's, and each '1' to '0' transition indicates a new piece starting with '0's.
   - If there are '0' to '1' transitions (`cut0 > 0`), the string needs `cut0 + cut1` pieces. Each transition (either '0' to '1' or '1' to '0') indicates a necessary cut to separate the pieces.

The program correctly identifies that each transition between '0' and '1' or '1' and '0' represents a necessary cut. The special case where there are no '0' to '1' transitions is handled appropriately by adding one to the count of '1' to '0' transitions.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's consider the first test case from the example: `11010`.

- Transitions:
  - From '1' to '0': Positions 1 to 2 and 3 to 4 (2 transitions).
  - From '0' to '1': Position 2 to 3 (1 transition).

- Calculation:
  - `cut0 = 1` (one '0' to '1' transition)
  - `cut1 = 2` (two '1' to '0' transitions)

- Result:
  - Since `cut0 > 0`, the number of pieces is `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 2 = 3`.

This matches the expected output for the first test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange a binary string into a sorted binary string based on the transitions between '0' and '1'. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
