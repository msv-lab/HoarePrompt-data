Output State: **The output state consists of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each query in the test cases. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `i`, and `j` are not preserved after the loop execution and revert to their initial or undefined states outside the loop, except for the printed results of the queries.**
