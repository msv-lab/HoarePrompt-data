The given Python code snippet only modifies the value of `dp[2]` to 3. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `dp[1]` is 1, and no other values of `dp` are mentioned, so we can only infer that `dp[2]` is now 3 after the assignment.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n; The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid; `dp[1]` is 1; `dp[2]` is 3.**
