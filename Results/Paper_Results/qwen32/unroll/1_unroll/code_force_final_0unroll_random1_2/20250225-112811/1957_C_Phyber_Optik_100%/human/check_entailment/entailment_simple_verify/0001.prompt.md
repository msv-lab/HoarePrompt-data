You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Game Rules**:
   - Players place rooks on an n x n chessboard.
   - You (the player) and the computer alternate turns.
   - You start first, placing a white rook, then the computer places a black rook.
   - Rooks cannot attack each other, meaning no two rooks can be in the same row or column.
   - If you place a rook at (r, c), the computer places a rook at (c, r).
   - If r = c, the computer skips its turn.
   - The game continues until no more valid moves are possible.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the number of possible final configurations of the board after k moves by you and the implied k moves by the computer.
   - Output the result modulo \(10^9+7\).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The game is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal (r = c).
   - The number of valid configurations depends on the number of unoccupied rows and columns.
   - The number of unoccupied rows and columns after k moves is \(n - 2k\) if no moves were on the main diagonal, and may be less if moves were on the main diagonal.

### Program Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with size 300007, which is sufficient given the problem constraints.
   - The function `func_1` is called to populate this DP array.

2. **DP Array Calculation**:
   - The DP array is used to store the number of possible configurations for a given number of unoccupied rows and columns.
   - The base cases are set: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`, which correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in a symmetric manner.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the board size \(n\) and the number of moves \(k\).
   - It reads the k moves and marks the rows and columns as invalid using a set `invalid`.
   - The number of valid configurations is then determined by `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which is the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining unoccupied rows and columns.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Invalid Rows and Columns**:
   - The program incorrectly adds both `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set for each move. This does not account for the fact that if `r == c`, the computer does not make a move.
   - The program should only add `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set if `r != c`. If `r == c`, only one of them should be added, or none should be added since the computer skips its turn.

2. **Handling of Main Diagonal Moves**:
   - The program does not correctly handle moves on the main diagonal (r = c). It should account for these moves separately to avoid over-counting or under-counting.

### Conclusion

The program has a critical flaw in how it handles moves on the main diagonal and the calculation of invalid rows and columns. This results in incorrect counts of valid configurations.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
