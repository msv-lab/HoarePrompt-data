Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a chessboard of size `n x n` where players place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other. Moves are mirrored by the computer, except when the move is on the main diagonal (r == c). We need to determine the number of final configurations possible after `k` moves.

### Code Analysis

1. **Initialization of `dp` array**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized with a length of 300007.
   - The function `func_1` is intended to fill this array with precomputed values.
   - The function `func_1` is indeed defined in the code, and it correctly calculates the number of ways to place rooks on a board using a recursive formula.

2. **Incorrect logic for `invalid` set**:
   - The `invalid` set is used to track rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.
   - The code correctly adds both `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set. However, this does not mean it treats rows and columns as the same; instead, it marks both the row and column as occupied, which is correct for the problem's constraints.

3. **Incorrect calculation of possible configurations**:
   - The program calculates the number of possible configurations using the `dp` array.
   - The `dp` array is supposed to store the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board with `i` rooks already placed.
   - The logic for calculating the number of valid configurations seems correct based on the precomputed values in the `dp` array. The formula used in `func_1` is a known combinatorial formula for this type of problem.

4. **Handling of the special case when `r == c`**:
   - The problem description mentions that if `r == c`, the computer skips its turn.
   - The code does not explicitly handle this case, but the logic for adding `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set implicitly handles it because the move will be counted as invalid for both the player and the computer.

### Function Summary

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`. It computes and stores a sequence of values in a list `dp` up to the index `n` using a specific recursive formula, which is correct for the problem.

### Original Assessment

The original assessment incorrectly identifies several issues with the code, especially regarding the `invalid` set and the handling of the special case when `r == c`. The `invalid` set logic is correct, and the special case is handled implicitly by the way moves are counted.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the provided logic and the function summary. The original assessment was inaccurate.

**Final: True**
