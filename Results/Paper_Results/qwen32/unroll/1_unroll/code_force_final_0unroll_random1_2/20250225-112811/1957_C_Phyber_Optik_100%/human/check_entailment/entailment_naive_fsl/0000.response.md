Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Initialization of `dp` array**: The `dp` array is initialized with a length of 300007, and the function `func_1` is called to fill this array. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the given code. This will result in a `NameError` when the program tries to call `func_1(300000)`.

2. **Incorrect logic for `invalid` set**: The `invalid` set is used to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. However, the logic for adding elements to this set is incorrect. The current code adds both `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set, which means it treats rows and columns as the same, which is not correct. Instead, it should maintain separate sets for rows and columns.

3. **Incorrect calculation of possible configurations**: The program calculates the number of possible configurations using the `dp` array, but the logic for calculating the number of valid configurations is incorrect. The `dp` array is supposed to store the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board with `i` rooks already placed, but the current logic does not correctly account for the constraints of the problem (e.g., the computer's mirroring moves).

4. **Handling of the special case when `r == c`**: The problem description mentions that if `r == c`, the computer skips its turn. The current code does not handle this special case correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To fix the program, we would need to:
- Define the `func_1` function to correctly initialize the `dp` array.
- Use separate sets to track occupied rows and columns.
- Correctly calculate the number of possible configurations, taking into account the constraints of the problem.
- Properly handle the special case when `r == c`.

Since the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, the correctness is **False**.
