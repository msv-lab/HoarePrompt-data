### Reasoning

After analyzing the problem description, the provided program, and the annotated version, we need to evaluate whether the program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations of the chessboard after k moves.

#### Problem Analysis Recap

1. **Game Rules**:
   - Players place rooks on an n x n chessboard.
   - Players alternate turns, with the player starting first.
   - Rooks cannot attack each other, meaning no two rooks can be in the same row or column.
   - If the player places a rook at (r, c), the computer places a rook at (c, r).
   - If r = c, the computer skips its turn.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the number of possible final configurations of the board after k moves by the player and the implied k moves by the computer.
   - Output the result modulo \(10^9+7\).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The game is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal (r = c).
   - The number of valid configurations depends on the number of unoccupied rows and columns.
   - The number of unoccupied rows and columns after k moves is \(n - 2k\) if no moves were on the main diagonal, and may be less if moves were on the main diagonal.

#### Program Analysis Recap

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with size 300007.
   - The function `func_1` is called to populate this DP array.

2. **DP Array Calculation**:
   - The DP array is used to store the number of possible configurations for a given number of unoccupied rows and columns.
   - The base cases are set: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the board size \(n\) and the number of moves \(k\).
   - It reads the k moves and marks the rows and columns as invalid using a set `invalid`.
   - The number of valid configurations is then determined by `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

#### Issues Identified in the Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Invalid Rows and Columns**:
   - The program incorrectly adds both `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set for each move. This does not account for the fact that if `r == c`, the computer does not make a move.
   - The program should only add `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set if `r != c`. If `r == c`, only one of them should be added, or none should be added since the computer skips its turn.

2. **Handling of Main Diagonal Moves**:
   - The program does not correctly handle moves on the main diagonal (r = c). It should account for these moves separately to avoid over-counting or under-counting.

#### Conclusion

The program has a critical flaw in how it handles moves on the main diagonal and the calculation of invalid rows and columns. This results in incorrect counts of valid configurations.

### Final Evaluation

Given the identified issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
