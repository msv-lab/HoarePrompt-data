### Reasoning:

The problem is about determining the number of possible final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves in a game involving white and black rooks. The game has specific rules about how rooks can be placed and how the computer mirrors the player's moves.

The provided program seems to be following a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. Let's break down the key parts of the program:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized to store precomputed values that represent the number of possible configurations for a given board size `i`.
   - The function `func_1` calculates these values using a specific recurrence relation: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. This relation is derived from the problem's constraints and the nature of the game.
   - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. These represent the number of configurations for a 1x1 and a 2x2 board, respectively.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and marks the rows and columns where rooks have been placed in the `invalid` set.
   - The number of remaining valid rows/columns is `n - len(invalid)`, as each move invalidates one row and one column.
   - The result for each test case is then found by looking up `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which gives the number of possible configurations for the remaining board size.

3. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The dynamic programming approach correctly captures the essence of the problem by precomputing the number of configurations for different board sizes.
   - The recurrence relation used in `func_1` is derived from the combinatorial nature of placing non-attacking rooks on a board.
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when `k = 0` (no moves have been made yet) or when `n - len(invalid) = 0` (no more moves can be made).

Given the above analysis, the program seems to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

### Correctness: **True**
