The code snippet creates a `Counter` object from the list `arr` and assigns it to the variable `nums`. The `Counter` object will count the occurrences of each integer in the list `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i < n, and the length of `arr` is `n`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. `nums` is a `Counter` object that contains the counts of each integer in `arr`.**

In simpler terms: The list `arr` remains unchanged. The new variable `nums` is a `Counter` object that holds the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
