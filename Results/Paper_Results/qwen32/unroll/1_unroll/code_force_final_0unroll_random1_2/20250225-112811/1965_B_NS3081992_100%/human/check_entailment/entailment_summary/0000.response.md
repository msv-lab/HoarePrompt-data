Let's analyze the provided functions and their roles in solving the problem.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to construct a sequence of non-negative integers such that:
1. No subsequence of the sequence sums to `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of the sequence that sums to `v`.

### Analysis of Functions:
1. **Input Reading Functions**:
   - `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, `func_8`, `func_9`, `func_10`, and `func_11` are all responsible for reading input from standard input. These are not directly related to the logic of constructing the sequence.

2. **Recursive Function (`func_12`)**:
   - This function appears to be related to some graph processing or ranking, but it does not seem relevant to the problem of constructing the sequence.

3. **GCD Function (`func_13`)**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor and coefficients using the Extended Euclidean algorithm. It is not directly related to the problem of constructing the sequence.

4. **Sequence Construction (`func_14`)**:
   - This function is the core of the solution. It constructs the sequence based on the values of `n` and `k`.
   - If `k == 1`, it handles a special case where the sequence is constructed differently.
   - For other values of `k`, it constructs the sequence by including powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n` and additional specific numbers to ensure the conditions are met.

5. **Main Function (`func_15`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and applies `func_14` to each test case, printing the results.

### Verification:
- The function `func_14` is the key to verifying the correctness of the solution.
- For `k == 1`:
  - The sequence `[2, 3, 2^i]` ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, and all other sums up to `n` can be formed (except 1).
- For other values of `k`:
  - The sequence includes powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`, `k-1 - sum(ans)`, `k+1`, `2*k+1`, and powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` up to `n`.
  - This construction ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` and all other sums up to `n` can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions, particularly `func_14`, construct the sequence in a way that meets the problem requirements. The main function `func_15` correctly applies this logic to multiple test cases.

**Correctness: True**
