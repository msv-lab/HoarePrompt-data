Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and their specific values are determined by the return values of `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string. `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. If `k` equals 1, `ans` is set to [2, 3] + [4, 8, ..., 2]. Otherwise, `ans` is set to [2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2].**
