Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string, `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`, `k` is not equal to 1, and `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string; `ans` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, and `bk` retain their initial values, and a new variable `ans` is introduced as an empty list.
