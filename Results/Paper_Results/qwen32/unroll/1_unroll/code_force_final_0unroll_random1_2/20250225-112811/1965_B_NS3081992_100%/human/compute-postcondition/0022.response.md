To determine the output state, we need to consider the different possible values of `k` and how they affect the list `ans`.

1. **If `k` equals 1:**
   - `ans` is set to `[2, 3] + [4, 8, ..., 2]`.
   - The sequence `[4, 8, ..., 2]` seems to be a mistake as it should logically be an increasing sequence. However, given the code, it will just be `[4, 8, ..., 2]` which is not a valid sequence, so it should be interpreted as an empty sequence.
   - Therefore, `ans` will be `[2, 3]`.
   - The length of `ans` is 2.
   - The joined string of `ans` is `"2 3"`.

2. **If `k` is not equal to 1:**
   - `ans` is set to `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2]`.
   - The length of `ans` is 5.
   - The joined string of `ans` is `"2 k-3 k+1 2*k+1 2"`.

Given the initial state, `n` and `k` are determined by the return values of `func_7()`, but we don't have the specific values of `n` and `k`. Therefore, we need to consider both cases.

Let's assume the values of `n` and `k` such that `k` can be either 1 or any other value within the range.

**Case 1: `k` equals 1**
- `ans` is `[2, 3]`.
- The length of `ans` is 2.
- The output string is `"2\n2 3"`.

**Case 2: `k` does not equal 1**
- `ans` is `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2]`.
- The length of `ans` is 5.
- The output string is `"5\n2 k-3 k+1 2*k+1 2"`.

Since the specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output State: **The program returns "2\n2 3" if k is 1, otherwise it returns "5\n2 k-3 k+1 2*k+1 2"**.
