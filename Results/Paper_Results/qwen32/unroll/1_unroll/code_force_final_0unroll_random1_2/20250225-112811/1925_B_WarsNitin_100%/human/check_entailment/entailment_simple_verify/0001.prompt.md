You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):

                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //

                    ans = max(ans, x // i)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to divide a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems is `x`, and the goal is to maximize the GCD of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

### Key Observations:
1. **Divisibility and Balance**: The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems. To maximize the balance, we need to find a divisor `d` of `x` such that `x` can be split into `n` sub-problems, each with a difficulty that is a multiple of `d`.

2. **Constraints**: The difficulties of the sub-problems must be positive integers, and their sum must be `x`.

### Solution Strategy:
The provided program iterates through possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`, it checks two conditions:
- If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, it means that `x` can be split into `n` sub-problems, each with a difficulty of `i`.
- If `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, it means that `x` can be split into `n` sub-problems, each with a difficulty of `x // i`.

If either of these conditions is satisfied, the program updates the maximum balance found so far.

### Correctness of the Program:
Let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `x = 10`, `n = 3`
- Possible splits: 
  - `10 = 4 + 2 + 4` (GCD = 2)
  - `10 = 3 + 3 + 4` (GCD = 1)
  - `10 = 2 + 2 + 6` (GCD = 2)
  - `10 = 1 + 1 + 8` (GCD = 1)
- Maximum GCD: 2
- The program correctly outputs `2`.

#### Example 2:
- Input: `x = 5`, `n = 5`
- Possible splits:
  - `5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1` (GCD = 1)
- Maximum GCD: 1
- The program correctly outputs `1`.

#### Example 3:
- Input: `x = 420`, `n = 69`
- Possible splits:
  - `420 = 6 * 69 + 6` (GCD = 6)
- Maximum GCD: 6
- The program correctly outputs `6`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the verification with the provided examples, the program correctly computes the maximum balance for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
