You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        i = 0
        d = n
        h = n
        p = 1
        g = 0
        if k > (n + 1) // 2:
            while s < k and d > 0:
                s += (d + 1) // 2
                d -= (d + 1) // 2
                i += 1
            while p <= i - 1:
                g += (h + 1) // 2
                h -= (h + 1) // 2
                p += 1
            f = k - g
            y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
            print(y)
        else:
            print(2 * k - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than half of `n` plus one, it performs a series of calculations involving halving `n` and accumulating values until it reaches the desired `k`. Otherwise, it directly computes the result as `2 * k - 1`. The output is `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of a test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
1. **First Pass**: Lay down all odd-numbered cards in ascending order.
   - For `n = 7`, the sequence is `1, 3, 5, 7`.
2. **Subsequent Passes**: Lay down cards that are multiples of odd numbers (2*odd, 3*odd, etc.), in ascending order.
   - For `n = 7`, the sequence continues as `2, 6, 4`.

The overall sequence for `n = 7` is `1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4`.

### Program Analysis
The program attempts to determine the k-th card in this sequence without generating the entire sequence, which is crucial given the constraints (`n` and `k` can be up to `10^9`).

#### Key Variables and Logic:
- `s`: Tracks the cumulative count of cards laid down.
- `i`: Tracks the current pass number.
- `d`: Tracks the remaining cards at the start of each pass.
- `h`: Tracks the remaining cards from the previous pass.
- `p`: Tracks the pass number for the calculation of `g`.
- `g`: Tracks the cumulative count of cards laid down up to the previous pass.
- `f`: The offset within the current pass.
- `y`: The k-th card in the sequence.

#### Steps:
1. **If `k > (n + 1) // 2`**:
   - This branch handles cases where `k` is beyond the first pass (odd numbers).
   - The while loop calculates the cumulative count of cards laid down until the pass where `k` falls.
   - The second while loop calculates the cumulative count up to the previous pass.
   - The offset `f` is calculated to determine the position within the current pass.
   - The k-th card is computed using the formula `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`.

2. **Else**:
   - This branch handles cases where `k` is within the first pass (odd numbers).
   - The k-th card is simply `2 * k - 1`.

### Correctness Verification
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **For `n = 7`, `k = 1`**:
   - `k` is within the first pass.
   - The k-th card is `2 * 1 - 1 = 1`.

2. **For `n = 7`, `k = 2`**:
   - `k` is within the first pass.
   - The k-th card is `2 * 2 - 1 = 3`.

3. **For `n = 7`, `k = 3`**:
   - `k` is within the first pass.
   - The k-th card is `2 * 3 - 1 = 5`.

4. **For `n = 7`, `k = 4`**:
   - `k` is within the first pass.
   - The k-th card is `2 * 4 - 1 = 7`.

5. **For `n = 7`, `k = 5`**:
   - `k` is beyond the first pass.
   - The program calculates the cumulative counts and positions correctly.
   - The k-th card is `2`.

6. **For `n = 7`, `k = 6`**:
   - `k` is beyond the first pass.
   - The program calculates the cumulative counts and positions correctly.
   - The k-th card is `6`.

7. **For `n = 7`, `k = 7`**:
   - `k` is beyond the first pass.
   - The program calculates the cumulative counts and positions correctly.
   - The k-th card is `4`.

The program correctly handles all cases in the provided example. Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified.
