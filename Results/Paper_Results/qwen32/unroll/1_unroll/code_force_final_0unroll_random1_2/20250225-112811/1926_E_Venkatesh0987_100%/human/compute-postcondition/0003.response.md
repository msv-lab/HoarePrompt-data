Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than half of `n` plus one, it performs a series of calculations involving halving `n` and accumulating values until it reaches the desired `k`. Otherwise, it directly computes the result as `2 * k - 1`. The output is `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of a test case.**
