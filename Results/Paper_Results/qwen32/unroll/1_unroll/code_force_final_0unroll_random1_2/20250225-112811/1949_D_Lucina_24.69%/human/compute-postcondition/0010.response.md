Postcondition: **`a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the i-th element (for i from 1 to n) is the total number of 'F' characters in the i-th row (or column) of the input matrix; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the i-th element (for i from 1 to n) is the total number of 'S' characters in the i-th row (or column) of the input matrix; `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all the strings from the input list; `sa` is a list of indices of rows (or columns) with 'F' characters but no 'S' characters; `sb` is a list of indices of rows (or columns) with 'S' characters but no 'F' characters. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.**
