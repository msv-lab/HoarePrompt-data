Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, and a list of `n` strings, where each string has `n` characters. Each character in the strings is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', and the matrix is symmetric (the i-th character of the j-th string is the same as the j-th character of the i-th string). The number of 'F' and 'S' characters in the input is at most floor(n/2). The function returns a modified version of the input list of strings based on certain rules, but the specific rules for modification are not provided in the given constraints and relationships.**
