You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, and a list of `n` strings, where each string has `n` characters. Each character in the strings is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', and the matrix is symmetric (the i-th character of the j-th string is the same as the j-th character of the i-th string). The number of 'F' and 'S' characters in the input is at most floor(n/2). The function returns a modified version of the input list of strings based on certain rules, but the specific rules for modification are not provided in the given constraints and relationships.
