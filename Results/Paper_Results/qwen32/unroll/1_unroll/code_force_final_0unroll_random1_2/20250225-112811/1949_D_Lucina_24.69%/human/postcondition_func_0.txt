The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, containing characters 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', and prints a modified version of the list where '?' characters are replaced by 'F' or 'S' based on specific rules involving the counts of 'F' and 'S' characters in each row and column.
