The code snippet provided only reads an integer `n` from the input, which is already defined in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `n` remains unchanged. No other variables are introduced or modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input is a list of n strings, where each string has n characters. The j-th character of the i-th string is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', and the i-th character of the j-th string is the same as the j-th character of the i-th string for all i and j. The number of 'F' and 'S' characters in the input is at most floor(n/2).**
