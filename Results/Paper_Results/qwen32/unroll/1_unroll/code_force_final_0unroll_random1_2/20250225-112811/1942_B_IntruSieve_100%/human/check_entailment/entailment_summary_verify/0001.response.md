Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
Farmer John provides an array `a` of length `n`, and we need to construct a permutation `p` such that for each `i`, `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`. The MEX (minimum excludant) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Constructing the Permutation `p`**:
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the permutation `p`.
   - It initializes `minn` to 0, which keeps track of the smallest unused number.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `used` to keep track of numbers that have been used in the permutation.

3. **Iterating Over the Array `a`**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0:
       - It appends `minn` to the `mex` list (which is the current MEX).
       - It marks `minn` as used in the `used` dictionary.
       - It increments `minn` until it finds the next unused number.
     - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0:
       - It calculates the number to append to `mex` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
       - It marks this number as used in the `used` dictionary.

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation for each test case, it prints the permutation.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Handling `arr[i] > 0`**:
  - When `arr[i] > 0`, the program correctly identifies the current MEX (`minn`) and appends it to the permutation.
  - It then updates `minn` to the next unused number, ensuring that future MEX calculations are correct.

- **Handling `arr[i] <= 0`**:
  - When `arr[i] <= 0`, the program calculates the number to append as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
  - This calculation is based on the condition `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`, which means `p[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - a[i]`.
  - The program correctly identifies the number to append by taking the absolute difference and ensures it is not already used.

### Issues in the Program:

Upon closer inspection, the handling of `arr[i] <= 0` seems problematic. The formula `p[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - a[i]` directly suggests that the value of `p[i]` should be `minn - arr[i]` when `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0. The absolute value operation (`abs(arr[i] - minn)`) is incorrect because it does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Correct Approach:

- For `arr[i] > 0`, the program correctly appends `minn` to `mex` and updates `minn`.
- For `arr[i] <= 0`, the program should append `minn - arr[i]` to `mex` and ensure that this value is not already used.

### Revised Program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = set()
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used.add(minn)
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            val = minn - arr[i]
            mex.append(val)
            used.add(val)
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it uses `abs(arr[i] - minn)` instead of `minn - arr[i]` for `arr[i] <= 0`. This change is necessary to correctly calculate the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.

**Final: False**
