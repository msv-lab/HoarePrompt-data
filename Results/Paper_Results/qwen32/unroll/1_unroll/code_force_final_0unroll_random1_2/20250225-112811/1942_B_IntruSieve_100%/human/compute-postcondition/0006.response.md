To understand the output state, let's analyze the loop step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - `n` is the number of integers in the current test case.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `arr` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `mex` is an initially empty list.
   - `minn` is initialized to 0.
   - `used` is an initially empty dictionary.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `arr` (from index 0 to n-1).
   - If the current element `arr[i]` is greater than 0:
     - Append `minn` to the `mex` list.
     - Mark `minn` as used in the `used` dictionary.
     - Increment `minn` until it finds the next smallest unused number.
   - If the current element `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0:
     - Compute the value `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
     - Append this computed value to the `mex` list.
     - Mark this computed value as used in the `used` dictionary.

3. **Output State**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases and is not modified in the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the number of integers in the current test case and is not modified in the loop.
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is the input list of integers and is not modified in the loop.
   - `arr` remains unchanged as it is the input list of integers and is not modified in the loop.
   - `mex` will be a list of integers constructed based on the rules specified in the loop.
   - `minn` will be the smallest integer that has not been used after the loop completes.
   - `used` will be a dictionary containing all the integers that have been used during the loop.

Output State: **`mex` is a list of integers constructed based on the rules specified in the loop, `minn` is the smallest integer that has not been used after the loop completes, and `used` is a dictionary containing all the integers that have been used during the loop.**
