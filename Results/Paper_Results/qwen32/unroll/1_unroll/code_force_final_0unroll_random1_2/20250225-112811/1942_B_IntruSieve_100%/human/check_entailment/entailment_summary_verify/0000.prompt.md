You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers for each test case. It then constructs and prints a list of integers based on specific rules involving the minimum unused non-negative integer and the absolute differences between the list elements and this minimum integer. The function outputs a space-separated list of integers for each test case, followed by an empty line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly reconstruct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). Let's analyze the issues with the provided code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX and Permutation Elements**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the elements of \( p \) by directly appending the MEX or a modified MEX value to the `mex` list. This does not ensure that the MEX is correctly calculated for each step and that the resulting permutation \( p \) satisfies the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

2. **Handling Negative Values in \( a \)**:
   - The program handles negative values in \( a \) by appending \( \texttt{abs}(a_i - \texttt{minn}) \) to the `mex` list. This is incorrect because the value of \( p_i \) should be derived based on the MEX minus \( a_i \), not the absolute difference.

3. **Maintaining Used Values**:
   - The program maintains a dictionary `used` to track the values that have been used in the permutation. However, the logic for updating `minn` and ensuring the next MEX value is correctly chosen is flawed.

Here is a corrected version of the program that properly reconstructs the permutation \( p \):

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    used = [False] * n
    p = []

    for i in range(n):
        mex = 0
        while used[mex]:
            mex += 1
        p.append(mex)
        used[mex] = True
        if mex != a[i] + p[i]:
            raise ValueError("No valid permutation exists based on the given array a.")

    print(" ".join(map(str, p)))
```

This corrected version ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated and that the permutation \( p \) is constructed such that \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \) for each \( i \). The original program fails to meet these requirements, hence it is incorrect.
