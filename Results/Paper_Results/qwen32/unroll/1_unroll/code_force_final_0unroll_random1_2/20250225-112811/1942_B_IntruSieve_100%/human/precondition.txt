The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the permutation p and the array a. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of array a. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
