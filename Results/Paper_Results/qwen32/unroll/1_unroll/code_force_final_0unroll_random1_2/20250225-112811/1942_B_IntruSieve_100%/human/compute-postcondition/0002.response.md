The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `mex`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `arr`. The only change is that `mex` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; For each test case, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mex` is an empty list.**
