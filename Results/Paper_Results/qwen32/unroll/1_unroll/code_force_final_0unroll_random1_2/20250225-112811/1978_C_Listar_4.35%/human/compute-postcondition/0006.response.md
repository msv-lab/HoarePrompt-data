The provided code snippet calls `func_3(l)`, which means it executes `func_3` with `l` as its argument. However, the code does not modify `n`, `k`, or `l` directly; it only uses `l` as an input to `func_3`. Since there is no return statement or assignment within the provided snippet, the values of `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `n` is not equal to 0, `l` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`**.
