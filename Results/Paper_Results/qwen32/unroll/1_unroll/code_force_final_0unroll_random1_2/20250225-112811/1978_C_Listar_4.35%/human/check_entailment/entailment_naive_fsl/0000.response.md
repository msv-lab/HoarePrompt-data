Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function incorrectly calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`). For a permutation of length `n`, the maximum Manhattan value is `n * (n - 1) / 2`, not `n**2 // 2` or `(n**2 - 1) // 2`.
   - The function returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` exceeds `max_k`. However, the problem statement does not require `k` to be even, and the maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` can indeed be an odd number.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function is supposed to generate a permutation with a specific Manhattan value `k`. However, the logic in `func_1` is incorrect and does not guarantee that the resulting permutation will have the desired Manhattan value.
   - The function modifies the list `l` by moving elements around based on the value of `k`, but the logic does not ensure that the final Manhattan value will match the input `k`.

3. **Function `func_4`**:
   - The function calls `func_2` to get `n` and `k`. If `n` is `0` (which should not happen based on the problem constraints), it prints "NO".
   - The function then calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and `func_3` to print it. However, if `func_2` returns `(0, 0)`, it should print "NO" instead of attempting to generate a permutation.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the input:
```
1
3 3
```

The correct output should be:
```
Yes
3 1 2
```

However, the provided code will not generate this output correctly. The function `func_2` will incorrectly determine that `k` is too large because it uses an incorrect formula for `max_k`. Additionally, even if `k` is within the correct range, `func_1` will not generate the correct permutation.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly handle the problem constraints and logic, leading to incorrect outputs in many cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
