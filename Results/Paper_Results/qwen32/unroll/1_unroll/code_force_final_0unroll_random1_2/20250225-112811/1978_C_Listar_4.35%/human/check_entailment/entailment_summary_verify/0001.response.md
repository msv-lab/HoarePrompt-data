### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summaries to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that the Manhattan value \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \) equals \( k \).
- If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".
- If such a permutation exists, we output "Yes" followed by the permutation.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads input values \( n \) and \( k \).
   - Checks if \( k \) is even. If not, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation can exist.
   - Calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k`:
     - If \( n \) is odd, `max_k` is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \).
     - If \( n \) is even, `max_k` is \( \frac{n^2}{2} \).
   - If `max_k` is less than \( k \), it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

   This logic is correct. The Manhattan value is always even, and the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \) is correctly calculated.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Constructs a permutation for given \( n \) and \( k \) (where \( k \) is already halved).
   - Initializes a list `l` with values from \( 1 \) to \( n \).
   - Iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, adjusting the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - The logic for adjusting the list is complex and relies on moving the last element to specific positions based on the value of \( k \).

   The logic in `func_1` is not straightforward and may not produce a permutation with the exact Manhattan value \( k \) for all valid test cases. The code modifies the list in a specific way, but without a deeper analysis or proof, it's unclear if it always works.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - Prints "YES" followed by the permutation.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - Orchestrates the process by calling `func_2` to get \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If \( n \) is 0 (indicating no valid permutation), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to get the permutation and `func_3` to print it.

   This function is correctly structured to handle the flow of the program based on the results from `func_2`.

#### Issues and Correctness:
- The code assumes that the Manhattan value can only be achieved if \( k \) is even. This is correct because the Manhattan value is always even for any permutation.
- The calculation of `max_k` is correct based on the problem constraints.
- The logic in `func_1` is complex and may not correctly construct a permutation for all valid \( k \). It does not guarantee that the resulting Manhattan value will always be \( k \) for all valid test cases.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the logic in `func_1` may not always produce a permutation with the exact Manhattan value \( k \). Therefore, the correctness of the program cannot be assured without further validation of `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program may not always produce the correct permutation for all valid inputs, especially due to the complex and potentially flawed logic in `func_1`.
