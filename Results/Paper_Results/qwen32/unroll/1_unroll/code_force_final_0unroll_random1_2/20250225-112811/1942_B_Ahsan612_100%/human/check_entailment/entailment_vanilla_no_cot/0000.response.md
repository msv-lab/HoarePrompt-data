Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to construct the permutation `p` by iterating through the array `a` in reverse order. However, there are a few issues with the approach that can lead to incorrect results:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `mex` to `n` and then tries to adjust it based on the values in `a`. However, the MEX should be dynamically calculated based on the elements of `p` as they are constructed. The current approach does not correctly account for the presence of elements in `p` as it builds it.

2. **Handling of Negative Values in `a`**:
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where `a[i]` is negative. The line `if mex > mex - ar[i]:` is not a reliable way to update `mex`. If `a[i]` is negative, `mex - ar[i]` could be larger than `mex`, and the program might incorrectly set `mex` to a value that is not the true MEX.

3. **Building the Permutation**:
   - The program constructs `p` by subtracting `a[i]` from `mex` and then updating `mex`. However, it does not ensure that each element in `p` is unique and within the range `[0, n-1]`. This can lead to invalid permutations.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to dynamically calculate the MEX of the current elements in `p` and use it to determine the next element in `p`. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = 0
        used = [False] * n
        
        for i in range(n):
            while used[mex]:
                mex += 1
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            used[res[i]] = True
        
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized to `0` because the smallest non-negative integer not in an empty set is `0`.
   - `used` is a boolean array of size `n` to keep track of which integers have been used in `p`.

2. **Building the Permutation**:
   - For each element in `a`, we find the current MEX by incrementing `mex` until we find an unused integer.
   - We then set `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]` and mark `res[i]` as used.

3. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation `res` is printed for each test case.

This corrected approach ensures that `p` is a valid permutation and satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
