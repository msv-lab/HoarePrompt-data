Output State: **For each test case, a list `res` of n integers is printed where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` starting from the end of the list `ar` to the beginning. The variable `mex` is initially set to `n` and is updated to the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` encountered during the iteration. The state of `t`, `n`, and `ar` from the initial state remains unchanged except that `ar` is processed to produce `res`.**
