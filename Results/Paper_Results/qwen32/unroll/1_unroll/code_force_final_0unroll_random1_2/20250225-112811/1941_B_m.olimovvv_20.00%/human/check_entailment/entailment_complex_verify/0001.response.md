### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the provided program: the program only checks the parity of the first and last elements and their immediate neighbors, which is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be reduced to zeros using the given operation. The key insight is that the operation preserves the parity of the sum of the array, so the sum of the array must be even for it to be possible to reduce all elements to zero.

The provided program does not calculate the sum of the array to check its parity, which is a crucial step in solving the problem. Instead, it incorrectly relies on the parity of the first and last elements and their neighbors, leading to incorrect results in many cases.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Calculate the Sum of the Array**: The sum of the array should be calculated.
2. **Check the Parity of the Sum**: If the sum is odd, it is impossible to make all elements zero, so the answer should be "NO". If the sum is even, further checks might be needed, but the problem can be simplified by checking the parity of the sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the solution. The correct approach involves checking the parity of the entire array sum.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
