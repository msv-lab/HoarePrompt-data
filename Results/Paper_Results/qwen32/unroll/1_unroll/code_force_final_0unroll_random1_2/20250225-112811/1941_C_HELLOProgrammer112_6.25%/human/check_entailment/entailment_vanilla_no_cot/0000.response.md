Correctness: **False**

The provided program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and prints their sum. However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful. The program does not consider overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to avoid both "map" and "pie" substrings.

For example, in the first test case with the string "mmapnapie", the program would output 2 because it counts one "map" and one "pie". However, it is possible to make the string beautiful by removing only two characters, for instance, the 4th and 9th characters, resulting in "mmanap", which does not contain either "map" or "pie". The program does not account for such optimal removals.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that considers the positions of "map" and "pie" substrings and determines the minimum deletions required.
