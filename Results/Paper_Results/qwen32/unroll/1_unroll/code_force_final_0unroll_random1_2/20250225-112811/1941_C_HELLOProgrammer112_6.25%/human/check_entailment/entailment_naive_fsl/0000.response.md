Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and prints their sum. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not account for overlapping substrings or the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

For example, consider the string "pmapie". The program would count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", resulting in an output of 2. However, to make the string beautiful, we only need to remove one character, either the first 'm' or the last 'e', resulting in "paie" or "pmapi" respectively, both of which are beautiful strings. Therefore, the correct output should be 1, not 2.

This example demonstrates that the program does not always provide the minimum number of deletions required, which is a requirement of the problem description. Hence, the program is incorrect.
