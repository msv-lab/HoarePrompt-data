The initial state provides us with information about the values of `n` and `k` which are the results of the function `func_4()`. However, the provided code snippet does not utilize the variables `n` and `k` in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Given this information, we can conclude that the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`.

Output: **NO**
