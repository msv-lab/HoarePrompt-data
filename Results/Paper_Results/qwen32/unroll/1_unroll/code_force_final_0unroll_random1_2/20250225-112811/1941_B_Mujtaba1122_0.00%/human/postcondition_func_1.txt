The function `func_2` modifies a list of non-negative integers by reducing certain elements based on specific conditions and then checks a condition using `func_1`. It prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns True, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The final state of the program includes a potentially modified list and a printed message indicating the result of the check.
