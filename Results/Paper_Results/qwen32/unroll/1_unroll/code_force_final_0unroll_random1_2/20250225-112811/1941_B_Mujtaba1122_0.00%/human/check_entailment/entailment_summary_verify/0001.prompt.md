You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO

    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` modifies a list of non-negative integers by reducing certain elements based on specific conditions and then checks a condition using `func_1`. It prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns True, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The final state of the program includes a potentially modified list and a printed message indicating the result of the check.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the provided code and reason through its correctness in the context of the problem statement.

### Problem Requirements:
The task is to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array `a` equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves choosing an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) and then changing the values of `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` according to the rules:
- `a[i-1] = a[i-1] - 1`
- `a[i] = a[i] - 2`
- `a[i+1] = a[i+1] - 1`

### Provided Code:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(list, n)`: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
2. `func_2(list, n)`: This function attempts to apply the operation to make all elements zero.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- The function iterates through the list from index `1` to `n-2` (inclusive).
- For each index `i` in this range, it checks if `a[i] > 1` and both `a[i-1]` and `a[i+1]` are greater than `0`.
- If these conditions are met, it tries to apply the operation. However, there is a mistake in the logic:
  ```python
  list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
  list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
  list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
  ```
  This logic will incorrectly subtract `list[i-1]` times itself from `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]`. The correct logic should be:
  ```python
  list[i - 1] -= 1
  list[i] -= 2
  list[i + 1] -= 1
  ```

### Additional Considerations:
- The function then calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero after attempting the operations. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness:
Given the mistake in the logic of `func_2`, the program will not correctly determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
