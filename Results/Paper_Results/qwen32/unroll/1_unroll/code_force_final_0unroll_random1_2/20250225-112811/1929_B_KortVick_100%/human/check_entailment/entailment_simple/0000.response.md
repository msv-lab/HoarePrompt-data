### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

**Problem Understanding:**
- We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals contain at least one colored cell.
- The grid has a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals.

**Key Observations:**
1. **Diagonals in the Grid:**
   - There are \( n \) diagonals running from the top-left to the bottom-right (main diagonals and their extensions).
   - There are \( n \) diagonals running from the top-right to the bottom-left (anti-diagonals and their extensions).
   - The total number of diagonals is \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Minimum Cells to Color:**
   - We need to cover \( k \) diagonals.
   - The optimal strategy is to color cells such that each colored cell covers as many diagonals as possible.
   - The center cell of the grid (if \( n \) is odd) or cells around the center (if \( n \) is even) will cover the maximum number of diagonals.

3. **Cases to Consider:**
   - **Case 1: \( 4n - 2 = k \)**
     - If \( k \) is equal to the total number of diagonals, we need to ensure that every diagonal has at least one colored cell.
     - The optimal solution is to color cells such that each cell covers two diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal).
     - The number of cells needed is \( \lceil \frac{4n - 2}{2} \rceil = 2n - 1 \). However, since we need to cover all diagonals and each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals, we need to color \( \lceil \frac{4n - 2}{2} \rceil = 2n - 1 \) cells, but due to the specific structure, we need \( k // 2 + 1 \) cells.
   - **Case 2: \( 4n - 2 \neq k \)**
     - If \( k \) is less than the total number of diagonals, we need to color cells to cover \( k \) diagonals.
     - The optimal solution is to color cells such that each cell covers as many diagonals as possible.
     - The number of cells needed is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

**Program Analysis:**
- The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
- For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
- It then checks if \( 4n - 2 = k \).
  - If true, it prints \( k // 2 + 1 \).
  - Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

**Verification with Examples:**
- **First Test Case:** \( n = 3, k = 4 \)
  - Total diagonals = \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - \( k \neq 10 \), so it prints \( \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
  - This matches the expected output.
- **Third Test Case:** \( n = 3, k = 10 \)
  - Total diagonals = \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - \( k = 10 \), so it prints \( 10 // 2 + 1 = 6 \)
  - This matches the expected output.

Based on the analysis and verification with examples, the program appears to be correct.

### Correctness: **True**
