In the provided for loop, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The loop head only includes the variable `_` which is a throwaway variable and `t` which is the number of iterations. Therefore, the only variable we need to adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

Given that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer where `t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
