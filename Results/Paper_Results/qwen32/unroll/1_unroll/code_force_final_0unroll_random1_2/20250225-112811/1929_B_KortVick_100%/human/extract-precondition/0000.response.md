Precondition: **The function receives input through standard input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) where n is the size of the square grid and k is the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell.**
