You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. It calculates and prints the minimum number of colored cells required to ensure that at least `k` diagonals of an `n x n` square grid contain at least one colored cell.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. 

There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total in an \( n \times n \) grid:
- \( n \) diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right (including the main diagonal).
- \( n \) diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left (including the main diagonal).
- \( 2(n - 2) \) diagonals that are not main diagonals.

The key observation is that by coloring cells on the main diagonals, we can cover the maximum number of diagonals with the minimum number of cells. Specifically:
- Coloring one cell on the main diagonal from top-left to bottom-right can cover 1 diagonal.
- Coloring one cell on the main diagonal from top-right to bottom-left can cover 1 diagonal.
- Coloring one cell on a non-main diagonal can cover 1 diagonal.

Thus, the strategy is to color cells on the diagonals such that the minimum number of cells is used to cover \( k \) diagonals.

Let's analyze the provided code:

1. If \( k = 1 \), it correctly prints 1 because only one diagonal needs to be covered, and one cell can cover one diagonal.
2. If \( k \leq 2(n + (n - 2)) \), the code prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This logic is not correct. The expression \( 2(n + (n - 2)) \) simplifies to \( 4n - 4 \), which is less than the total number of diagonals \( 4n - 2 \). The correct logic should consider that we can cover at least one diagonal per cell, and the minimum number of cells needed is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one from each direction).
3. If \( k > 4n - 4 \), the code prints `k // 2 + 1`. This logic is also incorrect. When \( k \) is large, the minimum number of cells needed is still \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

The correct logic should be to always print \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals, and we need to cover \( k \) diagonals.

The provided code does not correctly handle the logic for all cases, especially when \( k \) is large.
