You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)

        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: A sequence of integers printed for each test case, where each integer is the calculated `cnt` for that test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the logic implemented in the program step-by-step.

The problem is about determining the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the properties of the XOR operation:

1. XOR of a number with itself is 0.
2. XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
3. XOR is commutative and associative.

For Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be zero. The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position across all numbers is even.

Given the constraints that each number is between 1 and 4, we can represent these numbers in binary as:
- 1: 001
- 2: 010
- 3: 011
- 4: 100

The XOR of the sequence will be zero if:
- The count of numbers with the least significant bit set (1, 3) is even.
- The count of numbers with the second least significant bit set (2, 3) is even.
- The count of numbers with the most significant bit set (4) is even.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. It checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all equal and odd. If they are, Bob can win once because removing one of each will make their counts even, leading to a zero XOR.
2. It then calculates the number of times Bob can win by pairing up numbers. Since each pair can be removed without affecting the XOR (as each pair contributes to an even count of each bit), it adds the floor division of each count by 2 to the result.

Let's verify this logic with the provided examples:

1. For the input `1 1 1 0`:
   - Counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all 1 (odd and equal). Bob can win once by removing one of each.
   - The result is 1.

2. For the input `1 0 1 2`:
   - Counts of 1s and 3s are odd and equal. Bob can win once by removing one of each.
   - The result is 1.

3. For the input `2 2 2 0`:
   - We can pair up the 1s, 2s, and 3s, leading to 3 wins.
   - The result is 3.

4. For the input `3 3 2 0`:
   - We can pair up two 1s and two 3s, leading to 3 wins.
   - The result is 3.

5. For the input `0 9 9 9`:
   - We can pair up the 2s, 3s, and 4s, leading to 12 wins.
   - The result is 12.

The program correctly implements this logic. Therefore, the program is correct.
