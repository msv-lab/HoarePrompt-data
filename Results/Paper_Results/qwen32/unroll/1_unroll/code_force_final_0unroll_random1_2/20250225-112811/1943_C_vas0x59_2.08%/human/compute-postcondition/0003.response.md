To determine the output state, let's analyze what the loop does step by step.

The given loop is designed to build an adjacency list representation of an undirected graph. Here's a breakdown of the operations:

1. **Initialization**: Before the loop starts, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists. This list will eventually hold the adjacency list for the graph.

2. **Loop Iteration**: The loop runs `n - 1` times, which means it processes `n - 1` edges. In each iteration:
   - Two integers `u` and `v` are read from the input. These represent an edge between nodes `u` and `v`.
   - Since the nodes are 1-indexed in the input, we adjust them to be 0-indexed by subtracting 1 from each (`u -= 1` and `v -= 1`).
   - The adjacency list is updated by appending `v` to the list at index `u` and `u` to the list at index `v`. This reflects the undirected nature of the graph, as an edge from `u` to `v` implies an edge from `v` to `u`.

3. **Output State**: After the loop completes, `u2vs` will contain `n` lists. Each list at index `i` will contain the indices of all nodes that are directly connected to node `i` by an edge.

Given the loop's behavior, the output state of `u2vs` will be a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the nodes that are directly connected to the corresponding node.

**Output State: **u2vs is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node by an edge.**
