The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The precondition that `u2vs` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the neighbors of a vertex in a tree remains unchanged. The precondition regarding the range of `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3) is also still valid.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the neighbors of a vertex in a tree; `n` is the integer value provided by the user input (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3).**
