The code snippet provided initializes `u2vs` as a list of empty lists, with the number of inner lists being equal to the value of `n`. This means that `u2vs` will have `n` empty lists, each representing the neighbors of a vertex in a tree.

Given that `n` is the integer value provided by the user input and remains unchanged, the only change is in the initialization of `u2vs`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3).**
