test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, piles) such that n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and piles is a list of integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The total number of piles across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
