To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic it uses to compute the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in an `n x n` grid to ensure that at least `k` diagonals contain at least one colored cell.

### Analysis of the Problem

The grid has `4n - 2` diagonals in total, consisting of:
- `2n - 1` diagonals running from the top-left to the bottom-right (main diagonals and their extensions).
- `2n - 1` diagonals running from the top-right to the bottom-left (anti-diagonals and their extensions).

Given the constraints, we need to color the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.

### Analysis of the Program

The program processes each test case by splitting the input into `n` and `k`. It then uses the following conditions to determine the number of cells to color:

1. **If `k <= 4 * n - 4`:**
   - The program prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
   - This logic is based on the idea that you can cover two diagonals with one cell if they intersect at a cell. Therefore, to cover `k` diagonals, you need at least `ceil(k / 2)` cells.

2. **If `k == 4 * n - 3`:**
   - The program prints `2 * n - 1`.
   - This logic is based on the observation that you need `2n - 1` cells to cover `4n - 3` diagonals, which can be visualized by coloring cells along a main diagonal and one additional cell.

3. **If `k == 4 * n - 2`:**
   - The program prints `2 * n`.
   - This logic is based on the observation that you need `2n` cells to cover all `4n - 2` diagonals, which can be visualized by coloring cells along both main diagonals.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the program logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1: `n = 3, k = 4`**
   - `k <= 4 * n - 4` (4 <= 8), so the program prints `math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2`.
   - This matches the expected output.

2. **Test Case 2: `n = 3, k = 3`**
   - `k <= 4 * n - 4` (3 <= 8), so the program prints `math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`.
   - This matches the expected output.

3. **Test Case 3: `n = 3, k = 10`**
   - `k > 4 * n - 4` and `k == 4 * n - 2` (10 == 10), so the program prints `2 * n = 6`.
   - This matches the expected output.

4. **Test Case 4: `n = 3, k = 9`**
   - `k > 4 * n - 4` and `k == 4 * n - 3` (9 == 9), so the program prints `2 * n - 1 = 5`.
   - This matches the expected output.

5. **Test Case 5: `n = 4, k = 7`**
   - `k <= 4 * n - 4` (7 <= 12), so the program prints `math.ceil(7 / 2) = 4`.
   - This matches the expected output.

6. **Test Case 6: `n = 7, k = 11`**
   - `k <= 4 * n - 4` (11 <= 24), so the program prints `math.ceil(11 / 2) = 6`.
   - This matches the expected output.

7. **Test Case 7: `n = 2, k = 3`**
   - `k <= 4 * n - 4` (3 <= 4), so the program prints `math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`.
   - This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all given test cases and follows the logic derived from the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
