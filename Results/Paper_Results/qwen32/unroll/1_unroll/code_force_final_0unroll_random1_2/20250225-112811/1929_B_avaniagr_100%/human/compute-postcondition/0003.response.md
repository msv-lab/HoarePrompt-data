Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` representing the size of a square grid and an integer `k` representing the minimum number of diagonals that need to have at least one colored cell. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the requirement for `k` diagonals.**
