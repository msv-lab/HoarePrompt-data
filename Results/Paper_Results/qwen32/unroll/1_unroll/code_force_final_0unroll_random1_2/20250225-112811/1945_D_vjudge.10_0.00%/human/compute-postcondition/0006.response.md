Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m` where `m` is less than or equal to `n`. It also accepts two lists `a` and `b`, each containing `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case based on the provided values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`.**
