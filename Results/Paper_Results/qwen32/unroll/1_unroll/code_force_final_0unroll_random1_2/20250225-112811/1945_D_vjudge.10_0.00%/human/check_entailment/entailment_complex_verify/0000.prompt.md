You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates a cost based on specific conditions involving the elements of `a` and `b`, and prints the calculated cost for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in line. Let's analyze why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Costs**:
   - The program iterates from the end of the queue towards the `m`-th position and adds the minimum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` to the cost. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the cumulative cost of bribing multiple people.
   - The program then iterates from the `m`-th position to the beginning of the queue, but the logic here is also incorrect. It does not correctly account for the cumulative cost of bribing multiple people and ensuring that Kirill can move to the desired position.

2. **Lack of Dynamic Programming or Greedy Approach**:
   - The problem requires a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm, to efficiently calculate the minimum cost. The provided program does not use such an approach and thus fails to correctly compute the minimum cost in many cases.

3. **Edge Cases and General Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `m = 1` or when all `a_i` and `b_i` values are very large.
   - The program does not handle the general case where Kirill needs to bribe multiple people to move to the desired position, and it does not account for the cumulative cost of these bribes.

4. **Incorrect Logic in Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop conditions and the logic inside the loops do not correctly reflect the problem requirements. For example, the loop `for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):` does not correctly handle the case where `num_fila` is equal to `max_p`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
5 3
10 20 30 40 50
5 15 25 35 45
```
The correct answer for this test case is `20` (Kirill can bribe the second person for `20` coins to move to the second position). However, the provided program will likely not produce this correct answer.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in line. It fails to handle both edge cases and general cases correctly.
