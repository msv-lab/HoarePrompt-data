### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue of `n` people.
- He can swap places with any person in front of him (position `j < i`), paying `a_j` coins.
- For each person between `j` and `i` (exclusive), he also has to pay `b_k` coins.
- Kirill needs to determine the minimum number of coins he needs to spend to achieve his goal.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend. Here are some issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop Ranges and Conditions**:
   - The loop `for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):` incorrectly assumes that Kirill should swap with the last person and work backwards to position `max_p`. This does not account for the optimal path to reach one of the first `m` positions.
   - The logic inside this loop (`if a_values[y] < b_values[y]: custo += a_values[y] else: custo += b_values[y]`) is flawed. It does not consider the cumulative cost of bribing multiple people.

2. **Incomplete Handling of Swaps**:
   - The second loop `for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):` is also flawed. It does not correctly handle the cost calculation for multiple swaps needed to reach position `max_p`.
   - The condition `if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:` is not sufficient to determine the optimal path. It does not consider the possibility of multiple swaps and the cumulative cost.

3. **Lack of Priority Queue or Dynamic Programming**:
   - The problem requires finding the minimum cost path, which is typically solved using a priority queue (Dijkstra's algorithm) or dynamic programming to explore all possible swaps and their associated costs.

#### Correct Approach:
- Use a priority queue to explore all possible positions Kirill can move to, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach each position.
- For each person in front of Kirill, consider the cost of swapping with them and the additional cost of bribing people in between.
- Track the minimum cost to reach each of the first `m` positions and output the smallest of these costs.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the provided program's logic, it does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
