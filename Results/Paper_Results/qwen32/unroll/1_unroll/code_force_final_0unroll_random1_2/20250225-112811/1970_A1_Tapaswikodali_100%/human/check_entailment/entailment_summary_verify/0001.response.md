### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to verify the correctness of the program.

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The task is to perform a balanced shuffle operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle involves calculating the prefix balance for each character, sorting the characters based on these balances, and then constructing a new sequence from the sorted characters.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is not used in the provided program, so it is irrelevant to the correctness of `func_2`.
   - `func_2` is the main function that performs the balanced shuffle operation.
     - It initializes a list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects, which contain the prefix balance, position, and character.
     - It iterates through the input string `s`, updating the prefix balance and appending `BalanceInfo` objects to `balance_info`.
     - It sorts `balance_info` using a lambda function that sorts by prefix balance in ascending order and by position in descending order in case of ties.
     - It constructs the final result by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list and prints the result.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The summary for `func_2` states that the function accepts a balanced parentheses sequence and prints the original string `s` after performing a series of operations on it.
   - This summary is inaccurate because the function constructs and prints a new sequence, not the original sequence.

4. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly calculates the prefix balance for each character.
   - It stores the necessary information in the `balance_info` list.
   - The sorting step aligns with the problem's requirements.
   - The final result is constructed by concatenating the characters from the sorted list, which should produce the balanced shuffle as described.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.
   - The original assessment is mostly accurate, except for the function summary of `func_2`, which incorrectly states that the function prints the original string.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is correct, but the function summary for `func_2` is inaccurate. Given that the main task is to verify the correctness of the program and not the function summaries, we can conclude that the program itself is correct.

**Final: True**
