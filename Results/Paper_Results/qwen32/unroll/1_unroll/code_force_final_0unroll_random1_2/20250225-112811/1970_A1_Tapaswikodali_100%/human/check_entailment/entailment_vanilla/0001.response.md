Let's break down the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**: A balanced parentheses sequence (a string consisting of '(' and ')').
2. **Output**: The balanced shuffle of the input sequence.
3. **Balanced Shuffle Process**:
   - For each character in the input sequence, calculate the prefix balance.
   - Create a list of tuples that include the prefix balance, position, and character.
   - Sort this list by prefix balance in ascending order. In case of ties (same prefix balance), sort by position in descending order.
   - Construct the output sequence by concatenating the characters from the sorted list.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function seems to be intended for comparing two `BalanceInfo` objects based on the balance and position as described.
   - However, `func_1` is not used in the provided program, so it's not critical for the correctness of the given program.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Initialization**: 
     - `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
     - `balance_info` is an empty list to store the balance, position, and character information.
     - `balance` is initialized to 0 to track the prefix balance.
   - **Loop**:
     - For each character in the string `s`, a `BalanceInfo` object is created with the current balance, position, and character.
     - The balance is updated based on whether the character is '(' or ')'.
     - The `BalanceInfo` object is appended to `balance_info`.
   - **Sorting**:
     - The list `balance_info` is sorted using a lambda function as the key.
     - The lambda function sorts primarily by `balance` in ascending order and secondarily by `position` in descending order (achieved by negating `position`).
   - **Result Construction**:
     - The characters from the sorted `balance_info` list are joined to form the resulting string.
     - The result is printed.

### Verification:
- The program correctly calculates the prefix balance for each character.
- It stores the necessary information in the `balance_info` list.
- The sorting step aligns with the problem's requirements.
- The final result is constructed by concatenating the characters from the sorted list, which should produce the balanced shuffle as described.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
