To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to ensure that it correctly implements the described balanced shuffle operation. Let's break down the program and verify if it meets the requirements.

### Key Components of the Program

1. **Data Structure**:
   - The program uses a class `BalanceInfo` (which is not explicitly defined in the provided code but is assumed to be a custom class with `balance`, `position`, and `character` attributes).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects based on the criteria mentioned in the problem statement.
   - It compares the `balance` of two objects first. If they are different, it returns the difference.
   - If the balances are the same, it compares the `position` in reverse order (i.e., higher positions come first).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes a string `s` as input.
   - It calculates the balance for each prefix of the string and stores it along with the position and character in a list `balance_info`.
   - It sorts this list based on the criteria defined in `func_1`.
   - It then constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted list and prints it.

### Verification

- **Sorting Criteria**: The sorting criteria are correctly implemented in `func_2` using the lambda function `lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position)`, which matches the description in the problem statement.
- **Data Structure**: The program assumes the existence of a `BalanceInfo` class, which should have `balance`, `position`, and `character` attributes. Without this class definition, we cannot fully verify the correctness, but the sorting logic seems correct.
- **Output Construction**: The program constructs the final string by joining characters from the sorted `balance_info` list, which aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion

Assuming the `BalanceInfo` class is correctly defined with the required attributes, the provided code appears to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
