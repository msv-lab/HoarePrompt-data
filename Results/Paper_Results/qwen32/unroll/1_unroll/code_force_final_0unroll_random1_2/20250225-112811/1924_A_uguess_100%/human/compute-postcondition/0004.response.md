Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks if a given string can be divided into at least `n` sets of `k` distinct lowercase English alphabets. If possible, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string that includes the minimum required characters to meet the condition, then prints this constructed string.**
