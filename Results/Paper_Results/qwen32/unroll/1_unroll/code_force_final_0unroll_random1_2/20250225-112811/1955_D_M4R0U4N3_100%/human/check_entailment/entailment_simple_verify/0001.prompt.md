You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers, all initialized to 0. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `b_values`, `ans`, `curr`, `i`) do not retain their values after the loop finishes as they are local to each iteration of the outer loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `max_val` is set to 1,000,000, which is the maximum possible value for elements in arrays `a` and `b`.
   - `cnt_b` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of `max_val + 1` to count occurrences of each element in `b`.

2. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, we read the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - Arrays `a` and `b` are read as lists of integers.
   - We populate `cnt_b` with the counts of each element in `b`.
   - `b_values` is a set of unique elements in `b` for quick membership testing.

3. **Initial Window Check:**
   - We check the first subsegment of length `m` in array `a` to see if it contains at least `k` elements that can be matched with elements in `b`.
   - For each element in the first `m` elements of `a`, if it exists in `b_values`, we decrement its count in `cnt_b` and increment `curr` if the count remains non-negative.

4. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - For each subsequent subsegment, we slide the window one position to the right.
   - We adjust the counts in `cnt_b` and `curr` as follows:
     - If the element that is sliding out of the window is in `b_values`, we increment its count in `cnt_b` and decrement `curr` if the count becomes positive.
     - If the element that is sliding into the window is in `b_values`, we decrement its count in `cnt_b` and increment `curr` if the count remains non-negative.
   - After adjusting counts, we check if the current window is good by verifying if `curr` is at least `k`.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, we print the number of good subsegments.

6. **Resetting Counts:**
   - After processing each test case, we reset the counts in `cnt_b` for elements in `b_values` to zero to prepare for the next test case.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the sliding window technique to efficiently count the number of good subsegments. It uses a count array to keep track of the elements in the current window and adjusts the counts as the window slides. This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and can handle the upper limits of the input constraints.

**Correctness: **True**
