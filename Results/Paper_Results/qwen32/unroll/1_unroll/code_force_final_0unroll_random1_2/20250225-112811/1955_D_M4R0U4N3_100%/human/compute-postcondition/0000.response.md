Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each element satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Similarly, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `max_val` is 1000000.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is the introduction of the variable `max_val` which is assigned the value 1000000. All other variables and their constraints remain unchanged.
