### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem by efficiently counting the number of good subarrays of length `m` in array `a` that contain at least `k` elements also present in array `b`. Here's how the program works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `max_val` is set to 1,000,000 to accommodate the maximum possible value of elements in `a` or `b`.
   - `cnt_b` is an array of size `max_val + 1` used to count occurrences of elements in `b`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program reads the input values for `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It initializes a count array `cnt_b` to count the occurrences of elements in `b` and creates a set `b_values` for quick lookup.

3. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - The program first checks the initial subarray of length `m` in `a` and counts how many of its elements are present in `b` (i.e., have a positive count in `cnt_b`).
   - It then slides the window one element at a time from the start to the end of `a`, updating the count of elements entering and leaving the window.
   - For each new window, it checks if the count of matching elements (`curr`) is at least `k`. If so, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all subarrays for a test case, the program prints the count of good subarrays.

5. **Resetting for Next Test Case**:
   - After processing a test case, the program resets the count array `cnt_b` for the next test case.

### Correctness:

The program uses a sliding window technique, which is efficient for this type of problem. It correctly counts the number of good subarrays by maintaining a count of elements in the current window and updating it as the window slides. The use of a set for `b_values` ensures that the lookup for elements in `b` is efficient.

The program handles the constraints well and should work correctly for the given problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
