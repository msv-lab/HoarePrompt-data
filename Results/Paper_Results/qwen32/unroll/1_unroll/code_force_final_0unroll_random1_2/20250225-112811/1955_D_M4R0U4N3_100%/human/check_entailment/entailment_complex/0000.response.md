### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem efficiently using a sliding window approach. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and verifies its correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cnt_b` is initialized to a list of size `1000001` (to accommodate the maximum value of `a_i` and `b_i` which is `10^6`), with all elements set to `0`. This list will be used to count the occurrences of elements in `b`.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - For each test case, the program reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

3. **Counting Elements in `b`**:
   - The program iterates over the elements of `b` and increments the corresponding index in `cnt_b` for each element. This helps in quickly checking how many times each element of `b` appears in a subarray of `a`.

4. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - **Initial Window**: The program first processes the first subarray of length `m` in `a` (from index `0` to `m-1`). For each element in this subarray, if it is in `b_values` (a set of elements in `b`), the program decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` (which counts the number of matching elements).
   - **Subsequent Windows**: The program then slides the window one element to the right at a time. For each new window:
     - It first reverts the count for the element that is sliding out of the window.
     - It then adjusts the count for the new element that is sliding into the window.
     - It checks if the current window has at least `k` matching elements and updates `ans` accordingly.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all possible subarrays of length `m` in `a`, the program prints the count of good subarrays for the current test case.

6. **Reset for Next Test Case**:
   - Before processing the next test case, the program resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to `0`.

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Counting Matches**: The use of `cnt_b` ensures that the program can efficiently check how many times each element of `b` appears in the current window of `a`.
- **Sliding Window**: The sliding window technique allows the program to process each subarray in constant time after the initial window, making it efficient for large inputs.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as `k = 1` (where any subarray with at least one matching element is good) and `k = m` (where all elements in the subarray must match elements in `b`).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
