### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `max_val` is set to 1,000,000, which is the maximum possible value for elements in arrays `a` and `b`.
   - `cnt_b` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of `max_val + 1` to count occurrences of each element in `b`.

2. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, we read the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - Arrays `a` and `b` are read as lists of integers.
   - We populate `cnt_b` with the counts of each element in `b`.
   - `b_values` is a set of unique elements in `b` for quick membership testing.

3. **Initial Window Check:**
   - We check the first subsegment of length `m` in array `a` to see if it contains at least `k` elements that can be matched with elements in `b`.
   - For each element in the first `m` elements of `a`, if it exists in `b_values`, we decrement its count in `cnt_b` and increment `curr` if the count remains non-negative.

4. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - For each subsequent subsegment, we slide the window one position to the right.
   - We adjust the counts in `cnt_b` and `curr` as follows:
     - If the element that is sliding out of the window is in `b_values`, we increment its count in `cnt_b` and decrement `curr` if the count becomes positive.
     - If the element that is sliding into the window is in `b_values`, we decrement its count in `cnt_b` and increment `curr` if the count remains non-negative.
   - After adjusting counts, we check if the current window is good by verifying if `curr` is at least `k`.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, we print the number of good subsegments.

6. **Resetting Counts:**
   - After processing each test case, we reset the counts in `cnt_b` for elements in `b_values` to zero to prepare for the next test case.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the sliding window technique to efficiently count the number of good subsegments. It uses a count array to keep track of the elements in the current window and adjusts the counts as the window slides. This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and can handle the upper limits of the input constraints.

**Correctness: **True**
