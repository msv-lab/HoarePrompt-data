The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (where `m` is less than or equal to `n`), and two lists `a` and `b` of `n` integers each. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost to reach a specific position by either swapping or passing through positions, based on the costs provided in lists `a` and `b`. The function prints the best cost for each test case.
