You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, processing is a list of integers representing some processing state, da is an integer key present in the dictionary d, and rank is a list of integers used to store ranks or results corresponding to the keys in d.
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers representing some processing state, `da` is an integer key present in the dictionary `d`, `rank` is a list of integers used to store ranks or results corresponding to the keys in `d`, `tmp` is 1000000000. The length of the list `d[da]` is greater than 1.
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers representing some processing state (same as initial state), `da` is an integer key present in the dictionary `d`, `rank` is a list of integers used to store ranks or results corresponding to the keys in `d`, `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12` during any of the iterations.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the minimum value returned by `func_12` during any of the iterations, plus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` with integer keys and lists of integers as values, a list `processing` representing some processing state, an integer `da` which is a key present in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` used to store ranks or results corresponding to the keys in `d`. The function returns 1 in Case_1, and in Case_2, it returns the minimum value returned by `func_12` during any of the iterations, plus 1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: The program returns the minimum value returned by `func_12` during any of the iterations, plus 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
