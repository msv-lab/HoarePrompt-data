The `while` loop in the provided code snippet will execute as long as the `queue` is not empty. The loop head only involves the `queue` variable. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the `queue` to ensure it is not empty when the loop starts.

Given that the state right before the loop is that `queue` is a `deque` containing the tuple `((start, 0))`, the `queue` is already not empty. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree with keys as node integers and values as lists of neighboring node integers, `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `((start, 0))`, `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`**
