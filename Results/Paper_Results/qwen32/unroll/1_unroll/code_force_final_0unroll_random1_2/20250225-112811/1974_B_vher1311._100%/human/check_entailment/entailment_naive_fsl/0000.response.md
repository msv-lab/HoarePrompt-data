Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the string as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the `func_1` function where the mapping is created. The current mapping is designed to encode a string, not decode it. Specifically, the mapping is created such that each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (first to last, second to second last, etc.). However, to decode, we need to reverse this mapping: each character in the encoded string should be mapped back to its original character.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[-(i + 1)]: r[i] for i in range(len(r))}  # Corrected mapping for decoding
    return ''.join((mapping[char] for char in encoded))
```

With this change, the function should correctly decode the string as required by the problem description. Since the original code does not handle decoding correctly, the answer is **False**.
