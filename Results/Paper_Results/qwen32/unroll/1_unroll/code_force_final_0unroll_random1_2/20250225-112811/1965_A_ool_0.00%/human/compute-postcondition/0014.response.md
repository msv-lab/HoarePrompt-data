Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases. Each test case is defined by an integer `n` (number of piles) followed by `n` integers (initial number of stones in each pile). The function returns 'Alice' if the first element `t` is not equal to 1, or if a specific condition based on the uniqueness and consecutive differences of elements in the test case is met. Otherwise, it returns 'Bob'.**
