Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by two subsequent elements: an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. Additionally, `arr[0]` is equal to 1. `A` is `False`. `set_` is a list containing unique elements from the original `arr` and is now sorted. `not_c` is `True`.**

The variable `not_c` has been assigned the value `True`. All other variables remain unchanged.
