Let's analyze the given loop and its effect on the variables:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` is the number of test cases.
   - Each test case is followed by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - `A` is `False`.
   - `set_` is a sorted list of unique elements from `arr`.
   - `not_c` is `True`.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `len(set_) - 1`.
   - For each iteration, it checks if the difference between `set_[i]` and `set_[i - 1]` is greater than 1.
   - If the difference is greater than 1, `not_c` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
   - If the difference is not greater than 1, `A` is toggled (i.e., `A = not A`).

3. **Effect on Variables:**
   - `A` will be toggled based on the differences between consecutive elements in `set_`.
   - `not_c` will be `False` if any difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1, otherwise, it will remain `True`.

4. **Output State:**
   - `A` will be either `True` or `False` depending on the number of times it was toggled.
   - `not_c` will be `False` if any difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1, otherwise, it will be `True`.
   - The values of `arr`, `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` will remain unchanged.

Given that `arr[0]` is `1`, this means there is only one test case. The list `set_` will contain the unique elements from `arr`, which includes `1`, `n`, and the integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

Since `arr[0]` is `1`, and assuming there is only one test case, `set_` will be `[1, n, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]` sorted. The loop will iterate over this sorted list and check the differences between consecutive elements.

Let's consider the output state in a general format:

- If the differences between consecutive elements in `set_` are all ≤ 1, `not_c` will remain `True` and `A` will be toggled based on the number of elements.
- If any difference is > 1, `not_c` will be `False` and the loop will break.

Since the exact values of `n` and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not specified, we can't determine the exact value of `A`. However, we can determine the state of `not_c`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by two subsequent elements: an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. Additionally, `arr[0]` is equal to 1. `A` is `False` or `True` depending on the number of toggles. `set_` is a list containing unique elements from the original `arr` and is now sorted. `not_c` is `False` if any difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1, otherwise, it is `True`.**
