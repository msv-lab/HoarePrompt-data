Postcondition: **`A` is the opposite of its initial value if `not_c` is `True`; otherwise, `A` remains unchanged. `not_c` is `True` if the differences between consecutive elements in `set_` are all â‰¤ 1, otherwise `not_c` is `False`. The values of `arr`, `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.**
