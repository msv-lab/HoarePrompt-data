Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. Let's analyze the logic and identify the issues.

The current logic in the program is as follows:
1. Calculate `z` as `(y + 1) // 2`, which seems to be an attempt to determine the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
2. Calculate `m` as `15 * z - y * 4`, which seems to be an attempt to determine the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. If `m` is less than `a` (which is the number of test cases, not the number of 1x1 icons), then increment `z` by the number of additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

This logic has several issues:
- The calculation of `m` does not correctly determine the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
- The comparison `if m < a` is incorrect because `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of 1x1 icons.
- The logic for placing the 1x1 icons does not correctly account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.

Let's consider a specific test case to illustrate the issue:
- Input: `x = 10`, `y = 2`
- The program calculates `z` as `(2 + 1) // 2 = 1`.
- It then calculates `m` as `15 * 1 - 2 * 4 = 7`.
- Since `m` (7) is not less than `a` (number of test cases), it does not increment `z`.
- The output is `1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2` because one screen can hold one 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons, but we need two screens to hold two 2x2 icons and 10 1x1 icons.

Here's a corrected version of the program that handles the problem correctly:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        screens = y  # Each 2x2 icon needs its own screen
        remaining_space = (5 * 3 - 4) * y  # Calculate remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        if x > remaining_space:
            screens += (x - remaining_space + 14) // 15  # Calculate additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        print(screens)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
