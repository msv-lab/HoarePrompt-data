You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively. It then calculates and prints the total number of icons needed for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. Let's analyze the logic and identify the issues.

The current logic in the program is as follows:
1. Calculate `z` as `(y + 1) // 2`, which seems to be an attempt to determine the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
2. Calculate `m` as `15 * z - y * 4`, which seems to be an attempt to determine the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. If `m` is less than `a` (which is the number of test cases, not the number of 1x1 icons), then increment `z` by the number of additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

This logic has several issues:
- The calculation of `m` does not correctly determine the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
- The comparison `if m < a` is incorrect because `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of 1x1 icons.
- The logic for placing the 1x1 icons does not correctly account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.

Let's consider a specific test case to illustrate the issue:
- Input: `x = 10`, `y = 2`
- The program calculates `z` as `(2 + 1) // 2 = 1`.
- It then calculates `m` as `15 * 1 - 2 * 4 = 7`.
- Since `m` (7) is not less than `a` (number of test cases), it does not increment `z`.
- The output is `1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2` because one screen can hold one 2x2 icon and 11 1x1 icons, but we need two screens to hold two 2x2 icons and 10 1x1 icons.

Here's a corrected version of the program that handles the problem correctly:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        screens = y  # Each 2x2 icon needs its own screen
        remaining_space = (5 * 3 - 4) * y  # Calculate remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        if x > remaining_space:
            screens += (x - remaining_space + 14) // 15  # Calculate additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        print(screens)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
