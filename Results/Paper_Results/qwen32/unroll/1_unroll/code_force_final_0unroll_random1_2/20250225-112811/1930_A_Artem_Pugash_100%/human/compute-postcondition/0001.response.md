To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to analyze the code and the input format provided. 

The code processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It then sorts this list and calculates the score by summing up every other element starting from the first element (i.e., `l[0]`, `l[2]`, `l[4]`, etc.). This score is printed for each test case.

Since the code processes each test case independently and prints the result immediately after processing, the final output state will be a series of printed scores, one for each test case.

The output state will be the concatenation of the scores for each test case, separated by newlines.

Let's assume we have the following input:
```
2
3
1 3 5 7 9 11
2
2 4 6 8
```

The processing would be:
1. For the first test case (`n=3`, list `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]`):
   - Sorted list: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]`
   - Score: `1 + 5 + 9 = 15`
2. For the second test case (`n=2`, list `[2, 4, 6, 8]`):
   - Sorted list: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
   - Score: `2 + 6 = 8`

The output would be:
```
15
8
```

Therefore, the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished would be the printed scores for each test case. 

Output State: **the printed scores for each test case, one per line.**
