Reasoning:  
The provided Python program correctly implements the strategy to achieve the maximum final score. The key insight is that to maximize the score, you should always pair the smallest available numbers together because adding the smaller of each pair to the score will yield the highest possible total score.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it reads the list of `2n` integers and sorts them in ascending order.
3. **Scoring**: It then iterates over the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first (i.e., indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2). These elements represent the smallest `n` integers in the sorted list.
4. **Summation**: The program sums these `n` smallest integers to compute the score for that test case.
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the computed score for each test case.

By choosing the smallest `n` integers, the program ensures that it's always adding the smallest possible value from each pair to the score, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the final score according to the problem description.

Given the execution summary and the reasoning above, the program appears to be correct.
