### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the score by choosing pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. The optimal strategy to achieve this is to sort the list of integers in non-decreasing order and then sum up the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). This works because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements are paired together, ensuring that we are always adding the smallest possible values to the score.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it reads `2n` integers, sorts them in non-decreasing order, and stores them in a list `l`.
3. **Scoring Calculation**: It initializes `score` to 0 and then iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the value at each even index to `score`. This ensures that we are always adding the smaller of each pair of numbers in the optimal way.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the calculated score for each test case.

The given program correctly implements this strategy, and the provided example inputs and outputs confirm that the program behaves as expected.
