### Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the score by always selecting the smallest available numbers in pairs. Let's analyze the program and the annotations to verify if the program correctly implements this strategy.

1. **Sorting the List**:
   - The list of integers is sorted in ascending order using `sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))`.
   - This ensures that the smallest integers appear first in the list.

2. **Iterating and Summing**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2 using `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2)`.
   - In each iteration, it adds the element at index `i` to the score, which is the smaller of the two elements in the pair (since the list is sorted).
   - This strategy ensures that the smallest available numbers are consistently chosen to maximize the score.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program processes multiple test cases by wrapping the logic in a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the input, sorts the list, calculates the score, and prints the result.

### Verification Using Annotations:

- **State Before Function Call**:
  - The input consists of multiple test cases.
  - Each test case has a number `n` indicating `2n` integers.
  - The integers are provided in the next line.

- **State After Sorting**:
  - The list `l` is sorted in ascending order.
  - This ensures that the smallest numbers are at the beginning of the list.

- **State After Iteration**:
  - The program iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2.
  - It adds the first element of each pair (which is the smaller one) to the score.
  - This is consistent with the optimal strategy of always choosing the smallest available numbers.

- **State After Printing**:
  - The score for each test case is printed.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy of always selecting the smallest available numbers in pairs to maximize the score. The annotations support this reasoning by showing that the list is sorted and that the smallest numbers are consistently chosen. The program handles multiple test cases correctly and works as expected for the provided examples.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
