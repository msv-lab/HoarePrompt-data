You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads each query, which consists of two city indices `x_i` and `y_i`.

2. **Determining Closest Cities:**
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to determine the closest city for each city in the forward direction.
   - It reverses the list of cities and uses the same function to determine the closest city in the backward direction.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return a list where each element indicates the cost to move to the closest city in the given direction (either forward or backward).

3. **Calculating Prefix Sums:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward lists of closest city costs.
   - These prefix sums are used to quickly calculate the total cost to move from one city to another using the closest city strategy.

4. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, the program determines if the starting city index `a` is less than the destination city index `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it calculates the cost using the forward prefix sums.
   - If `a > b`, it calculates the cost using the backward prefix sums.
   - The cost is then printed for each query.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Implementation of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the cost to move to the closest city. However, it incorrectly assigns `1` when the closest city is forward and the actual distance when the closest city is backward. This logic is flawed because the problem specifies that moving to the closest city always costs `1` coin, not the actual distance.
   - The correct implementation should assign `1` to each element of the list returned by `func_1`, indicating that moving to the closest city always costs `1` coin.

2. **Handling of Prefix Sums:**
   - The prefix sums are calculated based on the incorrect values from `func_1`. Since the values in `func_1` are incorrect, the prefix sums will also be incorrect, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

3. **Logic for Query Processing:**
   - The logic for processing queries is correct in terms of using the prefix sums, but since the prefix sums are incorrect, the results will be incorrect.

### Conclusion

Given the issues with the implementation of `func_1` and the resulting incorrect prefix sums, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
