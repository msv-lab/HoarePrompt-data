#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains the following elements in order: a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, and a list of m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the queries. n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5. Each a_i is a non-negative integer and a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9. Each x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999
        
        forward = 99999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: cities is [[1, 3, 5, 7], [(1, 2), (3, 4)]], prog_cities is [1, 2, 2]
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns prog_cities which is [1, 2, 2]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list of city coordinates and determines for each city (except the first and last) whether the next city is closer or if the difference in coordinates to the next city should be recorded. It returns a list where each element corresponds to the result of this comparison for each city between the first and last.
