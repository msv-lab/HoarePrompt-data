You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains the following elements in order: a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, and a list of m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the queries. n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5. Each a_i is a non-negative integer and a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9. Each x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999
        
        forward = 99999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: cities is [[1, 3, 5, 7], [(1, 2), (3, 4)]], prog_cities is [1, 2, 2]
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns prog_cities which is [1, 2, 2]
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `cities`, which is a list of lists. Each inner list contains a list of integers representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order and a list of pairs of integers representing queries. The function returns a list `prog_cities` which is [1, 2, 2] for the given input constraints and test cases.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns prog_cities which is [1, 2, 2]


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
