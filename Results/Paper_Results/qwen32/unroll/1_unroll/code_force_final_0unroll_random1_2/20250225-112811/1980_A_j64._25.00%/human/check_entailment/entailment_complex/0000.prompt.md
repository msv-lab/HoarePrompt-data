Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, an integer m such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.

    return results
    #The program returns `results`, which is a list of `t` integers. Each integer in `results` represents the number of missing characters needed for the corresponding test case in `test_cases`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` calculates the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `test_cases` where each element is a tuple containing the number of problems `n`, the number of upcoming rounds `m`, and a string `a` of problem difficulties. The function returns a list of `t` integers, each indicating the number of missing problem difficulties required to meet the demand for each test case.
