#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value that is input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value that is input by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. The function `func_2` does not take any parameters and returns a map object that is the result of applying `int` to each element in the input split by spaces.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the `int` function to each element of the input string split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_3` does not take any parameters and returns a list of integers. The integers in the list are obtained by splitting a line of input, which is expected to contain space-separated integer values.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting a line of input that contains space-separated integer values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into space-separated components, converts each component into an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_4` does not take any parameters. It reads input from standard input, which is expected to be a single line of space-separated integers. The function returns a sorted list of these integers.
def func_4():
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers that were read from standard input as a single line of space-separated integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads a single line of space-separated integers from standard input and returns a sorted list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. The function `func_5` does not take any input parameters.
def func_5():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element of the input string, split by whitespace, into a string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` takes no input parameters and returns a map object that converts each element of a space-separated input string into a string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_6()`. Therefore, no precondition can be derived based on the provided function signature.
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters from the input provided to the function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts no parameters and returns a list of characters from the input provided to the function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_7` does not have any parameters in its signature, hence there are no variables to describe in terms of their values or relationships.
def func_7():
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a list of strings that are the sorted version of the input string split into individual words.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` takes an input string, splits it into individual words, sorts these words alphabetically, and returns them as a list of strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_8(arr):

    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans`, which contains the cumulative products of the elements in `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list containing the cumulative products of the elements in the input list.

    #The program returns `ans`, which is a list containing the cumulative products of `arr` from the end to the start.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list containing the cumulative products of the original list's elements, calculated from the end to the start.
