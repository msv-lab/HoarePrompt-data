arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of the array a for a test case, followed by the elements of the array a for that test case. The first element of arr is the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4). For each test case, the first element is the length of the array n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and the next n elements are the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
