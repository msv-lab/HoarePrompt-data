Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
1. There is no subsequence of the sequence that sums to `k`.
2. For all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there is a subsequence of the sequence that sums to `v`.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_11`) that are not directly related to solving the problem, and two main functions (`func_14` and `func_15`).

- `func_14`: This function appears to generate the sequence for a given pair `(n, k)`.
- `func_15`: This function reads the number of test cases and applies `func_14` to each test case.

Let's analyze `func_14` in detail:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads `n` and `k` using `func_7`.

2. **Handling Special Case `k == 1`:**
   - If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, it returns the sequence `[2]`.
   - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and then adds powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

3. **Handling General Case `k != 1`:**
   - It constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
   - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence.
   - Finally, it adds powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

### Evaluation:

- **Special Case `k == 1`:**
  - The sequence `[2]` works for `n == 2` because the only possible sums are `0` and `2`, and `1` cannot be formed.
  - For other values of `n`, the sequence `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2 ensures that all sums up to `n` except `1` can be formed.

- **General Case `k != 1`:**
  - The sequence constructed ensures that all sums up to `n` except `k` can be formed.
  - The inclusion of `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` ensures that `k` cannot be formed as a sum of the sequence elements.
  - The powers of 2 ensure that all sums up to `n` can be formed, except `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs sequences that satisfy the problem's conditions for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
