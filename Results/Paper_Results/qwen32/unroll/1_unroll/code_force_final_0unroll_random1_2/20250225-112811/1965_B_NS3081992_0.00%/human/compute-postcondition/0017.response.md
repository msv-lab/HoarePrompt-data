The code snippet appends `k + 1` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially `[2, k - 3]`. After appending `k + 1`, `ans` will be `[2, k - 3, k + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is `[2, k - 3, k + 1]`.**
