The code snippet provided initializes a list `ans` with the values `[2, 3]`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, or `l`.

Given that `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, and `k` is currently 1 with `n` not equal to 2, these values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `k` is 1, `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is `[2, 3]`.**
