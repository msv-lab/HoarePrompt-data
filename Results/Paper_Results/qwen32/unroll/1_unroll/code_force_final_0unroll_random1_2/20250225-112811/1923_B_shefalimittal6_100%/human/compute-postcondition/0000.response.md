Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of n monsters, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of n monsters such that -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n and x[i] != 0 for all i, and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired in one second. `n` is the length of the list `a`.**

Natural Language: The value of `n` is now the length of the list `a`. The other variables `a`, `x`, and `k` remain unchanged.
