Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of n monsters, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of n monsters such that -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n and x[i] != 0 for all i, and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired in one second. `n` is the length of the list `a`. `sorted_indices` is a list of indices of `x` sorted by the absolute values of the elements in `x`. `distance` is 0. `pos` is 0.**

In natural language: The value of `pos` has been set to 0. All other variables (`a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, and `distance`) remain unchanged.
