### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program using the annotated code and the problem description to ensure its correctness.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Speed Calculation**: The speed between two points `a[i-1]` and `a[i]` is calculated as `(a[i] - a[i-1]) / (b[i] - b[i-1])`. This is correct as per the problem statement.
2. **Handling of Query Points**: For each query point `d`, the program finds the segment `[a[s-1], a[s]]` where `d` lies and calculates the time taken to reach `d` from `a[s-1]` using the speed in that segment.
3. **Edge Cases**: 
    - When `d` is exactly at one of the known points `a[i]`, the time is directly `b[i]`.
    - When `d` is 0, the time should be 0.
    - When `d` is equal to `n`, the time should be `b[k]`.

#### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
    - `t = int(input())`: Correctly reads the number of test cases.
    - `n, k, q = map(int, input().split())`: Correctly reads the values for `n`, `k`, and `q`.
    - `a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`: Correctly reads and initializes the list `a` with an additional `0` at the beginning.
    - `b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`: Correctly reads and initializes the list `b` with an additional `0` at the beginning.

2. **Calculating Differences**:
    - `ad = [0]` and `bd = [0]`: Initializes lists to store differences.
    - `for i in range(1, len(a))`: Loops through the list `a` to calculate the differences `ad`.
    - `for i in range(1, len(b))`: Loops through the list `b` to calculate the differences `bd`.

3. **Calculating Speeds**:
    - `v = [0]`: Initializes list to store speeds.
    - `for i in range(1, len(a))`: Loops through the list `a` to calculate the speeds `v`.

4. **Processing Queries**:
    - `for l in range(q)`: Loops through each query.
    - `ql = int(input())`: Reads the query point `d`.
    - `s = bisect_left(a, ql)`: Finds the segment where `d` lies.
    - `if a[s] == ql`: Checks if `d` is exactly at one of the known points.
    - `ql -= a[s - 1]`: Adjusts `ql` to find the relative position within the segment.
    - `m += b[s - 1]`: Adds the time taken to reach the start of the segment.
    - `m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`: Calculates the additional time to reach `d` from the start of the segment.
    - `print(int(m), end=' ')`: Prints the result rounded down to the nearest integer.

#### Edge Cases:
1. **Single Point (n = 1, k = 1, q = 1)**:
    - Input: `1 1 1\n1\n1\n0`
    - Expected Output: `0`
    - The program correctly handles this case as it directly returns `b[0]` for `d = 0`.

2. **Multiple Points with Same Time**:
    - Input: `5 2 2\n1 5\n1 1\n2\n3`
    - Expected Output: `1 1`
    - The program correctly handles this case as the speed between `a[0]` and `a[1]` is `0`, and the speed between `a[1]` and `a[2]` is also `0`, resulting in the same time for all points.

3. **Point at the End**:
    - Input: `10 1 1\n10\n10\n10`
    - Expected Output: `10`
    - The program correctly handles this case as it directly returns `b[1]` for `d = 10`.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem description and all edge cases. The annotations confirm that the program's behavior aligns with the expected logic and calculations.
