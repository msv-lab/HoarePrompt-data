Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `k`, and `q`, a sorted list `a` of `k` integers, a sorted list `b` of `k` integers, and `q` queries where each query is an integer `d`. The function processes each query and returns a result based on the provided lists and the query value `d`.**
