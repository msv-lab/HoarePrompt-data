Output State: **The output state consists of the results of q queries for each of the t test cases. For each query d, the output is either the value b[s] if d matches an element a[s] in list a, or the calculated interpolated value m based on the differences in lists a and b. The final output for each test case is a line of space-separated results for each query, followed by a newline character.**
