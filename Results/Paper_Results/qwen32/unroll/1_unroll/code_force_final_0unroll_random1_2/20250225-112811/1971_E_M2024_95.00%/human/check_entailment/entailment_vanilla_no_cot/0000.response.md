Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of the program and its correctness:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the final destination `n`, the number of points `k`, and the number of queries `q`. It also reads the sequences `a` and `b` which represent the positions and times at which the car reaches those positions respectively.

2. **Distance and Time Differences**: The program calculates the differences between consecutive points in `a` and `b` to determine the distance and time intervals between each pair of adjacent signs. This is stored in `ad` and `bd`.

3. **Speed Calculation**: For each interval, the program calculates the speed `v` of the car as the distance divided by the time taken to travel that distance.

4. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the interval in which the queried point `d` lies. It then calculates the exact time it takes to reach `d` by summing up the time taken to reach the previous point and the time taken to travel the remaining distance within the current interval.

5. **Output**: The program prints the rounded down time for each query.

The program handles all the edge cases described in the problem statement, including when the queried point `d` exactly matches one of the known points, and efficiently computes the required times for large inputs within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
