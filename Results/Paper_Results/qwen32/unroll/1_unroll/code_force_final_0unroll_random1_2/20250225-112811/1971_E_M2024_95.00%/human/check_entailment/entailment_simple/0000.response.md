### Reasoning:
Let's break down the program to ensure it correctly handles the problem requirements and matches the provided execution states.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - It then reads the list `a` (which includes `0` at the beginning) and the list `b` (which also includes `0` at the beginning).

2. **Calculating Differences:**
   - `ad` is calculated as the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
   - `bd` is calculated as the differences between consecutive elements of `b`.

3. **Calculating Speeds:**
   - `v` is calculated as the speed of the car between each pair of consecutive points. This is done by dividing the distance `ad[i]` by the time `bd[i]`.

4. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query `d`, the program determines which segment of the journey `d` lies in using `bisect_left`.
   - If `d` exactly matches a point in `a`, the corresponding time from `b` is printed.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the time taken to travel from the previous point to `d` using the precomputed speed for that segment and adds it to the time taken to reach the previous point.

5. **Output:**
   - The results for each query are printed on a single line separated by spaces, and after each test case, a newline is printed.

### Verification Against Sample Input:
Let's verify the program using the sample input:

**First Test Case:**
- `n = 10`, `k = 1`, `q = 3`
- `a = [0, 10]`, `b = [0, 10]`
- Queries: `0`, `6`, `7`
  - For `d = 0`, the answer is `b[0] = 0`.
  - For `d = 6`, the answer is `b[0] + (6 - a[0]) * (b[1] - b[0]) / (a[1] - a[0]) = 0 + 6 * 10 / 10 = 6`.
  - For `d = 7`, the answer is `b[0] + (7 - a[0]) * (b[1] - b[0]) / (a[1] - a[0]) = 0 + 7 * 10 / 10 = 7`.

**Second Test Case:**
- `n = 10`, `k = 2`, `q = 4`
- `a = [0, 4, 10]`, `b = [0, 4, 7]`
- Queries: `6`, `4`, `2`, `7`
  - For `d = 6`, the answer is `b[1] + (6 - a[1]) * (b[2] - b[1]) / (a[2] - a[1]) = 4 + 2 * 3 / 6 = 5`.
  - For `d = 4`, the answer is `b[1] = 4`.
  - For `d = 2`, the answer is `b[0] + (2 - a[0]) * (b[1] - b[0]) / (a[1] - a[0]) = 0 + 2 * 4 / 4 = 2`.
  - For `d = 7`, the answer is `b[1] + (7 - a[1]) * (b[2] - b[1]) / (a[2] - a[1]) = 4 + 3 * 3 / 6 = 5.5` (rounded down to `5`).

**Third Test Case:**
- `n = 1000000000`, `k = 1`, `q = 1`
- `a = [0, 1000000000]`, `b = [0, 1000000000]`
- Query: `99999999`
  - For `d = 99999999`, the answer is `b[0] + (99999999 - a[0]) * (b[1] - b[0]) / (a[1] - a[0]) = 0 + 99999999 * 1000000000 / 1000000000 = 99999999`.

**Fourth Test Case:**
- `n = 6`, `k = 1`, `q = 3`
- `a = [0, 6]`, `b = [0, 5]`
- Queries: `2`, `6`, `5`
  - For `d = 2`, the answer is `b[0] + (2 - a[0]) * (b[1] - b[0]) / (a[1] - a[0]) = 0 + 2 * 5 / 6 = 1.6666666666666667` (rounded down to `1`).
  - For `d = 6`, the answer is `b[1] = 5`.
  - For `d = 5`, the answer is `b[0] + (5 - a[0]) * (b[1] - b[0]) / (a[1] - a[0]) = 0 + 5 * 5 / 6 = 4.166666666666667` (rounded down to `4`).

All these results match the expected output, so the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
