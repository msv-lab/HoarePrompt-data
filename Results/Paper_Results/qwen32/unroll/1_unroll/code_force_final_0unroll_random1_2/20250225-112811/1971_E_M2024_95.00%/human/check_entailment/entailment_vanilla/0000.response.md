Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - It then reads the list of points `a` and times `b`, prepending a `0` to each to account for the starting point.

2. **Distance and Time Differences Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the distance differences `ad` between consecutive points in `a`.
   - It calculates the time differences `bd` between consecutive points in `b`.
   - It calculates the speed `v` for each segment between consecutive points using the formula `v[i] = ad[i] / bd[i]`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `d`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the first index `s` in `a` such that `a[s] >= d`.
   - If `d` is exactly equal to `a[s]`, it prints `b[s]` as the answer.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time taken to reach `d` by:
     - Adding the time `b[s - 1]` taken to reach the previous point.
     - Calculating the additional time to travel the remaining distance `ql = d - a[s - 1]` at the speed `v[s]` of the segment.
     - The additional time is calculated as `bd[s] * ql / ad[s]` and added to the total time.
   - The total time is then rounded down using `int(m)` and printed.

### Correctness Verification

- **Distance and Speed Calculation:**
  - The program correctly calculates the distances and speeds between consecutive points, which are necessary for determining the time taken to travel any distance `d`.

- **Query Handling:**
  - The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the correct segment is identified for the query point `d`.
  - The additional time calculation within the segment is accurate and correctly uses the speed of that segment.
  - The rounding down of the total time using `int(m)` is consistent with the problem requirement.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `d` exactly matches one of the known points in `a` by directly returning the corresponding time in `b`.
  - The program also handles queries where `d` is between two known points by interpolating the time based on the speed of the segment.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem, accurately calculating the time taken to reach each query point `d` based on the given points and times.

**Correctness: True**
