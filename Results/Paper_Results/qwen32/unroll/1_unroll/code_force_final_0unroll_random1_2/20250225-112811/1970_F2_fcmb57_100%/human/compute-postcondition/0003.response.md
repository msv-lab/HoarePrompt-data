Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which represent the number of lines (N) and the number of columns (M) in a field, respectively. Both `a` and `b` are integers where 3 <= N <= 99 and 3 <= M <= 99, and both must be odd. The function returns a tuple `(x + dx, y + dy)`, which likely represents the new coordinates after applying some movement `dx` and `dy` to the initial coordinates `(x, y)` on the field.**
