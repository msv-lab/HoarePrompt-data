### Reasoning:

Let's break down the given program and check its correctness based on the problem description and the provided examples.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field (`N` and `M`).
   - It initializes dictionaries to keep track of player positions, goals, and the Quaffle's position.
   - It also initializes a dictionary to map movement commands to coordinate changes.

2. **Reading the Field**:
   - The program reads the field line by line and populates the dictionaries with the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - It correctly identifies the positions of the Quaffle, goals, and players.

3. **Processing Moves**:
   - For each move, the program checks the type of entity performing the action and the action itself.
   - It updates the positions of players and the Quaffle according to the move.
   - It handles player eliminations when a player and the Bludger are in the same position.
   - It correctly handles the scoring conditions:
     - If a player throws the Quaffle into a goal of the opposing team, it increments the score for that team.
     - If a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, it increments the score for the opposing team.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the events in the correct format and order.
   - It prints the final score at the end of the game.

### Issues Identified:
- The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]`. The double equals `==` is a comparison operator, not an assignment operator `=`.
- The condition `if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:` and `if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:` should be `elif` instead of `if` because a player can't be in both goals at the same time. The current implementation will check both conditions and potentially print both goals if the player is in a goal, which is incorrect.
- The logic for moving the Quaffle after a goal is scored needs to be corrected. If a player scores in their own goal, the Quaffle should be moved to the middle of the field, not the player's position.

### Corrected Code:
```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[0] == '.Q':
        quidditch[0] = func_1(quidditch[0], mouvements[mo[1]])
    elif mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        if '.B' in players:
            elimines = []
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    elimines.append(k)
            elimines.sort()
            for c in elimines:
                print(i, c, 'ELIMINATED')
                if quidditch[1] == c:
                    quidditch = [players[c], '']
                del players[c]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]  # Corrected assignment
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle  # Corrected Quaffle movement
        elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:  # Changed to elif
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle  # Corrected Quaffle movement
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a few critical issues that need to be fixed for it to be correct. After addressing these issues, the program should work as expected.

**Correctness: **False** (before the corrections)**  
**Correctness: **True** (after the corrections)**
