Precondition: **a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field, where 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd; b is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field, where 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd. The field is a 2D grid of size N x M, where each cell contains either "..", "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9", "RG", "BG", ".Q", or ".B". The number of players for each team (R and B) is between 1 and 10. There is exactly one Quaffle and at most one Bludger on the field. The number of steps (T) is a non-negative integer where 0 <= T <= 10000. Each step is a valid action performed by an entity on the field, which can be a player or a ball.**
