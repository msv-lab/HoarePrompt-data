The input consists of a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), the number of piles. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), where a_i is the number of stones in the i-th pile. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
