To determine the output state, we need to consider the provided code snippet and how it affects the variables. Here's the code snippet again for reference:

```python
func_2(max_index, min_index)
```

This line of code calls the function `func_2` with the arguments `max_index` and `min_index`. The function call itself does not change the values of `max_index` or `min_index` directly; it merely passes them to the function `func_2`. Therefore, the values of `max_index` and `min_index` remain unchanged after this function call. The other variables (`n`, `max_index`, and `min_indices`) also remain unchanged based on the initial state provided.

The only thing that happens is the execution of `func_2(max_index, min_index)`, but the return value of `func_2` is not captured or assigned to any variable, so it does not affect the state of the program in terms of variable values.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged; `max_index` remains unchanged; `min_indices` remains unchanged; `min_index` remains unchanged.**
