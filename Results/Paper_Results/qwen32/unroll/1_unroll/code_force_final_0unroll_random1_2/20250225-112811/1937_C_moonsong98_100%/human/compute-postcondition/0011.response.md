The code snippet assigns the value of the first element in the list `min_indices` to the variable `min_index`. The values of `n` and `max_index` remain unchanged. The list `min_indices` is also not modified by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2; `max_index` is n-1; `min_indices` is a list containing all indices that are considered equal to `max_index` by `func_1`; `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`.**
