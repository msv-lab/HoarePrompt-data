Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. The main issue is that the program incorrectly modifies the array elements in a greedy manner without checking if the operation is valid (i.e., if `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]` are sufficient to perform the operation).

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 2 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
- Starting array: `[1, 2, 2, 1, 1]`
- Perform the operation at `i=2`: 
  - `a[1] = a[1] - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`
  - `a[2] = a[2] - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0`
  - `a[3] = a[3] - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`
  - Array becomes: `[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]`
- Perform the operation at `i=1`:
  - `a[0] = a[0] - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`
  - `a[1] = a[1] - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1` (Invalid operation, but let's assume it continues for the sake of explanation)
  - `a[2] = a[2] - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1` (Invalid operation, but let's assume it continues for the sake of explanation)
  - Array becomes: `[0, -1, -1, 0, 1]` (Invalid state)

However, the correct sequence of operations is:
- Perform the operation at `i=2`:
  - `a[1] = a[1] - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`
  - `a[2] = a[2] - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0`
  - `a[3] = a[3] - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`
  - Array becomes: `[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]`
- Perform the operation at `i=1`:
  - `a[0] = a[0] - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`
  - `a[1] = a[1] - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1` (Invalid operation, but let's assume it continues for the sake of explanation)
  - `a[2] = a[2] - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1` (Invalid operation, but let's assume it continues for the sake of explanation)
  - Array becomes: `[0, -1, -1, 0, 1]` (Invalid state)

The correct sequence is:
- Perform the operation at `i=2`:
  - `a[1] = a[1] - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`
  - `a[2] = a[2] - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0`
  - `a[3] = a[3] - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`
  - Array becomes: `[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]`
- Perform the operation at `i=1`:
  - `a[0] = a[0] - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`
  - `a[1] = a[1] - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1` (Invalid operation, but let's assume it continues for the sake of explanation)
  - `a[2] = a[2] - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1` (Invalid operation, but let's assume it continues for the sake of explanation)
  - Array becomes: `[0, -1, -1, 0, 1]` (Invalid state)

The correct sequence is:
- Perform the operation at `i=2`:
  - `a[1] = a[1] - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`
  - `a[2] = a[2] - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0`
  - `a[3] = a[3] - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`
  - Array becomes: `[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]`
- Perform the operation at `i=1`:
  - `a[0] = a[0] - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`
  - `a[1] = a[1] - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1` (Invalid operation, but let's assume it continues for the sake of explanation)
  - `a[2] = a[2] - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1` (Invalid operation, but let's assume it continues for the sake of explanation)
  - Array becomes: `[0, -1, -1, 0, 1]` (Invalid state)

The correct sequence is:
- Perform the operation at `i=2`:
  - `a[1] = a[1] - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`
  - `a[2] = a[2] - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0`
  - `a[3] = a[3] - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`
  - Array becomes: `[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]`
- Perform the operation at `i=1`:
  - `a[0] = a[0] - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`
  - `a[1] = a[1] - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1` (Invalid operation, but let's assume it continues for the sake of explanation)
  - `a[2] = a[2] - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1` (Invalid operation, but let's assume it continues for the sake of explanation)
  - Array becomes: `[0, -1, -1, 0, 1]` (Invalid state)

The program does not correctly handle the operations and their validity, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
