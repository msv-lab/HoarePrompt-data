The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `t` is the integer read from the input, which means `t` could be any integer. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
