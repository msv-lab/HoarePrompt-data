The code snippet `t, = R()` reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer. Since `R` is a lambda function designed to handle this, it will take the first line of input and assign the first (and only) integer in that line to the variable `t`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`) and the precondition constraints remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
