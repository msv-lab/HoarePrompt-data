The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer. This function is typically used to read multiple space-separated integers from a single line of input.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen are already defined. The lambda function `R` does not directly modify these variables or introduce new values for them. Instead, it provides a way to read new input data in subsequent lines of code.

Since the lambda function `R` is defined but not used in the provided code snippet, the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.**
