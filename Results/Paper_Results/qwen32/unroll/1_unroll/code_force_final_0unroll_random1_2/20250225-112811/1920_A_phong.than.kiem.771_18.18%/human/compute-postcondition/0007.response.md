Output State: **The program returns a list of integers where each integer is obtained by converting each element in the list `items` to an integer. If `space` is True, `items` is a list of substrings split from `line` by spaces, and if `space` is False, `items` is a list of characters from `line`. Since `to_int` is True, each element in `items` is converted to an integer.**

In simpler terms: The program returns a list of integers derived from `items`. If `space` is True, `items` contains substrings split from `line` by spaces; if `space` is False, `items` contains individual characters from `line`. Each element in `items` is converted to an integer before being included in the returned list.
