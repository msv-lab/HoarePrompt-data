To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition `index != -1`. The loop will execute if `index` is not equal to -1, meaning `substring` must be found within `string` at least once.

Given:
- `string` is a value of type string.
- `substring` is a value of type string.
- `indices` is an empty list.
- `index` is the starting index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` or -1 if `substring` is not found.

To ensure the loop executes:
- `index` must not be -1. This implies that `substring` must be found within `string` at least once.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`string` contains `substring` at least once, `substring` is a value of type string, `indices` is an empty list, `index` is the starting index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`**

This ensures that `index` will not be -1, and the loop can execute its first iteration.
