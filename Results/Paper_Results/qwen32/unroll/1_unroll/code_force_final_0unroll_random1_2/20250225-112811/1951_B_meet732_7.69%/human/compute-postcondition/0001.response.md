Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of inputs. Each pair consists of two integers `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of cows and your cow's index, respectively, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all `a_i`'s being pairwise different. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `x` is the value of the element at index `k` in the list `a` for each test case; `ind` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet only initializes an empty list `ind`, and does not affect the values of `a` or `x`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of `a` and `x`, while `ind` is now an empty list.
