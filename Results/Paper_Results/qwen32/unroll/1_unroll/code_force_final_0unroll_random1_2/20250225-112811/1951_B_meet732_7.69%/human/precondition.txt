a is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, k, ratings), with n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) being the number of cows, k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) being the index of your cow, and ratings being a list of n distinct integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The length of the list a is the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
