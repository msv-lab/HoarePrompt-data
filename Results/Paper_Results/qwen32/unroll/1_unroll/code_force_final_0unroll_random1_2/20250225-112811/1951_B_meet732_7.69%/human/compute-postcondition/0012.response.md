Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of inputs. Each pair consists of two integers `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of cows and your cow's index, respectively, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all `a_i`'s being pairwise different. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `x` is the value of the element at index `k` in the list `a` for each test case; `ind` is a list containing the indices of up to two cows whose ratings are higher than `x`; `c` is the count of cows in `ind`, which is at most 2. If the current value of `k` is not 14, `ind` is not an empty list. The current value of `len(ind)` is 1, and the first element of `ind` is 0.**
