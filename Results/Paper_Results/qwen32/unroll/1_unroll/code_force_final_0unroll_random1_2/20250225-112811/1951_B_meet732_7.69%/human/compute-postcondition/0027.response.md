Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` of the list represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` (number of cows) and `k` (your cow's index), followed by a list of `n` integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The function processes each test case and returns different values based on the following conditions:
- Case_1: If a specific condition is met, it returns `n - 1`.
- Case_2: If a different condition is met, it returns `k - 1`.
- Case_3: If another condition is met, it returns `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the index of a cow whose rating is higher than `x` and `ind[0] > k`.
- Case_4: If a condition involving `k` and `ind[0]` is met, it returns the maximum of `(k - ind[0])` and `(ind[0] - 1)`.
- Case_5: If a condition involving the second cow in `ind` and `k` is met, it returns the minimum value between the index of the second cow in `ind` minus 1 and `k` minus 1.
- Case_6: If a condition involving `ind[0]` and `ind[1]` is met, it returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
- Case_7: If a final condition involving `ind[0]` and `k` is met, it returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.**
