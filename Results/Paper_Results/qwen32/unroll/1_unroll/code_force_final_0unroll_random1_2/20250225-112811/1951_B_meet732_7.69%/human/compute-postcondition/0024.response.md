Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.**

This means that the program calculates the two differences: the first difference is between the first index in `ind` minus 1, and the second difference is between the second index in `ind` minus the first index in `ind`. It then returns the larger of these two differences.
