To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze its logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing a series of operations. Each operation allows you to select two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

### Key Observations:
1. **Base Case**: If the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are different colors, the only way to make the whole grid the same color is if all the squares in the first row and the last row are the same (either all 'W' or all 'B'), and similarly, all the squares in the first column and the last column are the same.

2. **Corner Cases**:
   - If the grid has only one cell, the answer is trivially "YES".
   - If the grid has only one row or one column, the answer is "YES" if all cells in that row/column are the same.
   - If the grid has more than one row and one column, the answer is "YES" if the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same color, or if the conditions mentioned in the base case are met.

### Program Analysis:
Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = []
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        ans = 'YES'
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
            impossible = True
            for j in range(m - 1):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
            impossible = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
        print(ans)
```

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic for Checking Rows and Columns**: The program checks if all adjacent cells in the first and last rows are the same and all adjacent cells in the first and last columns are the same. However, this is not sufficient. The program should check if all cells in the first and last rows are the same and all cells in the first and last columns are the same, not just adjacent cells.

2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the grid has only one row or one column explicitly. It relies on the logic for checking rows and columns, which may not work correctly in these cases.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program is not correct because it does not properly handle the conditions for making the entire grid the same color when the top-left and bottom-right corners are different.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
