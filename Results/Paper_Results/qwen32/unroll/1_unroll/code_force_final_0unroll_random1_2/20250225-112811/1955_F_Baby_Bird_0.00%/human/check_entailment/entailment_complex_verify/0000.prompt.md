You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains four integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: the results of `sum(p) // 2` for each test case, concatenated and separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates a result based on these counts and prints the result. The result for each test case is determined by checking if exactly three of the first three counts are odd, adding 1 if true, and then adding half the sum of all four counts.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes numbers optimally.
- **Winning Condition**: Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
- **Input**: 
  - `t`: Number of test cases.
  - For each test case: Four integers representing the count of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the sequence.
- **Output**: For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Program Analysis:

The provided program is as follows:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4` representing the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

2. **Processing**:
   - `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`: This line modifies the input counts to be even by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2. This effectively reduces each count to the nearest even number. However, this is not necessary for the problem and doesn't align with the problem's requirements.
   - `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3`: This checks if the first three counts (counts of 1, 2, and 3) are all odd. If they are, it returns 1, indicating Bob can win at least once.
   - `sum(p) // 2`: This calculates the total number of pairs that can be removed, which is half the total count of numbers (after making them even).

3. **Output**:
   - The final result is the sum of the two above conditions. If the first three counts are all odd, it adds 1 to the total number of pairs that can be removed.

### Issues Found:
- **Incorrect Handling of Counts**: The program incorrectly modifies the counts to be even, which is not required. The problem does not require the counts to be even.
- **Incorrect Logic for Bob's Wins**: The logic for determining Bob's wins is flawed. The condition `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3` only checks if the first three counts are odd, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. There are more complex conditions based on the bitwise XOR properties that need to be considered.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider a counterexample to show the program's incorrectness:

**Input**:
```
1
1 1 1 1
```
**Expected Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**:
- The sequence is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- Eve can remove numbers optimally to make the XOR zero multiple times. For example, removing `1` and `1` first results in `[2, 3, 4]`, and the XOR of these numbers is `2 ^ 3 ^ 4 = 5` (non-zero). Then, removing `2` and `3` results in `[4]`, and the XOR is `4` (non-zero). However, removing `1` and `3` first results in `[1, 2, 4]`, and the XOR is `1 ^ 2 ^ 4 = 7` (non-zero). Removing `1` and `4` first results in `[1, 2, 3]`, and the XOR is `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0` (zero). Removing `2` and `4` first results in `[1, 1, 3]`, and the XOR is `1 ^ 1 ^ 3 = 3` (non-zero). Removing `2` and `3` first results in `[1, 1, 4]`, and the XOR is `1 ^ 1 ^ 4 = 4` (non-zero). Removing `3` and `4` first results in `[1, 1, 2]`, and the XOR is `1 ^ 1 ^ 2 = 2` (non-zero). Removing `1` and `2` first results in `[1, 3, 4]`, and the XOR is `1 ^ 3 ^ 4 = 6` (non-zero). Thus, Bob can win at most twice.

**Program Output**:
```
1
```

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the problem correctly and fails to provide the correct output for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
