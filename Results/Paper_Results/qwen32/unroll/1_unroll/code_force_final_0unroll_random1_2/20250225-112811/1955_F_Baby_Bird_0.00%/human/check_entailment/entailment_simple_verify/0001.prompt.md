You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains four integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: the results of `sum(p) // 2` for each test case, concatenated and separated by spaces.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR is zero.
- Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.
- Numbers in the sequence are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Eve removes one number at a time until the sequence is empty.
- We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Bitwise XOR Analysis:
- XOR of a number with itself is 0.
- XOR of 1 and 3 is 2.
- XOR of 2 and 4 is 6, but since we are dealing with numbers up to 4, the XOR of 2 and 4 is effectively 0 (considering only the lower 3 bits).
- XOR of 1 and 2 is 3.
- XOR of 1 and 4 is 5, but again, considering only the lower 3 bits, it is 1.
- XOR of 3 and 4 is 7, but considering only the lower 3 bits, it is 3.

### Key Insight:
- Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. This happens when the count of numbers contributing odd values to the XOR is even.
- Numbers 1 and 3 contribute odd values to the XOR, while 2 and 4 contribute even values (since 2 and 4 are powers of 2 and do not contribute to the lower 2 bits in XOR with themselves).

### Optimal Strategy:
- Eve should aim to remove numbers in such a way that the count of numbers contributing odd values (1 and 3) remains even as long as possible.
- If the count of 1s and 3s is odd, Bob can win once before Alice wins.
- After each game, the total number of numbers reduces by one, and Eve can adjust her strategy accordingly.

### Program Analysis:
The program given is:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

- The program reads the input for each test case.
- It processes the first three elements of `p` to check if all are odd (which is not relevant to the problem as we need to consider all elements).
- It then calculates `sum(p) // 2` which is the total number of games played (since one number is removed per game).
- The logic `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if the first three elements are odd, which is not the correct approach to determine Bob's wins.

### Correct Approach:
- Count the number of 1s and 3s.
- If the count of 1s and 3s is odd, Bob can win once initially.
- The rest of the games are determined by the total number of games played, which is `sum(p) // 2`.

### Correct Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        odd_count = p[0] + p[2]  # Count of 1s and 3s
        bob_wins = odd_count % 2 + sum(p) // 2
        print(bob_wins)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
