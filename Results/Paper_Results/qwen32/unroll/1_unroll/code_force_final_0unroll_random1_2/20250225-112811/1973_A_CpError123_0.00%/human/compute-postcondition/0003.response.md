To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `resultats` list based on the input `cas_de_test`.

The loop iterates over each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in the `cas_de_test` list and applies the following logic:
1. It calculates the total points: `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`.
2. If `total_points` is odd, it appends `-1` to the `resultats` list and continues to the next iteration.
3. If `total_points` is even, it calculates the total matches: `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
4. It then checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`. If either condition is true, it appends `-1` to the `resultats` list and continues to the next iteration.
5. If the above conditions are not met, it calculates the number of draws: `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
6. If `egalites` is negative, it appends `-1` to the `resultats` list; otherwise, it appends `egalites // 2` to the `resultats` list.

The `resultats` list will contain the results of each test case after the loop completes.

Given the initial state, the output state will be the `resultats` list populated with the results of each test case after applying the above logic.

Output State: **resultats is a list containing the results of each test case after the loop has executed all iterations.**
