The function reads multiple test cases, each with an integer \( n \) and a permutation of integers from 0 to \( n-1 \). It interactively queries up to 3n times to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in the permutation. The goal is to identify and return a pair of indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices (\( p_i \oplus p_j \)) is maximized.
