Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It interactively queries up to 3n times to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The function's goal is to identify and return a pair of indices i and j such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices (p_i âŠ• p_j) is maximized.**
