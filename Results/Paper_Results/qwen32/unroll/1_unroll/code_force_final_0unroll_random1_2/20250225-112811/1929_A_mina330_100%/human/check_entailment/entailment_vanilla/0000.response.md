To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array based on the problem description.

The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The optimal way to do this is to sort the array in ascending order and then consider the difference between the largest and smallest elements, as this would be the maximum single difference that can contribute to the beauty.

However, the beauty calculation involves the sum of all consecutive differences, not just the single largest difference. The correct approach is to maximize each individual difference, which is achieved by arranging the array in either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order. The maximum beauty would then be the sum of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in this sorted order.

The provided program sorts the array and then only calculates the difference between the last and the first element (a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]), which does not account for the sum of all consecutive differences. This is incorrect because it does not consider the contributions of all intermediate differences.

For example, in the third test case of the problem statement (with the array [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]), the correct approach would be to sort the array to [43, 54, 80, 90, 100] and then calculate the beauty as (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57. However, the provided program would only calculate 100 - 43 = 57, which is not the correct sum of all differences.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
