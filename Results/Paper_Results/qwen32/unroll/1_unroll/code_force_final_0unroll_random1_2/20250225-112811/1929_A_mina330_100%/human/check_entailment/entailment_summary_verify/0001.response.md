The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning:

### Problem Analysis:
The beauty of the array is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order. The beauty is calculated as:

\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]

when the array is sorted in ascending order, because all intermediate terms cancel out.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program sorts the array and then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is exactly \(a_n - a_1\) for a sorted array. This is the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's consider the third test case from the problem statement: the array \([100, 54, 80, 43, 90]\).

1. **Sorting the array**: \([43, 54, 80, 90, 100]\)
2. **Calculating the beauty**:
   - The beauty is \((54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\).
   - The provided program calculates \(100 - 43 = 57\), which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and computing the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The original assessment, which states that the program is incorrect, is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
