### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the array and then calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. However, this approach does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement.

The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this sum, we want to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, but the correct calculation is the sum of these differences, not just the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

For example, consider the array [1, 2, 3]. The beauty is calculated as (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2. The provided program would incorrectly calculate the beauty as 3 - 1 = 2 for this case, which happens to be correct in this specific instance but is not the general solution.

The correct approach is to sort the array and then compute the sum of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements.

### Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. It calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements instead of the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
