### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The current implementation simply prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

To maximize the beauty of the array, we need to maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. One effective way to achieve this is to arrange the elements in an alternating pattern of the largest and smallest remaining elements. This will ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

The function summary correctly describes the current implementation but does not address the problem's requirement for maximizing the beauty of the array. Therefore, the original assessment is correct in identifying that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
