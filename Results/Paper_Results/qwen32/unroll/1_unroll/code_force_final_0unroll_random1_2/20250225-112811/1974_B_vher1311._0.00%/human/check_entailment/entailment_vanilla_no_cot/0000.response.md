Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string. The `func_1` function is intended to decode the string, but it does not properly map each character in the encoded string back to its original character as described in the problem statement. 

Here are the issues with the current implementation:
1. The function `func_1` attempts to replace characters in the string `s` directly, which is not the correct approach for decoding. Instead, it should map each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the original string based on the symmetric property.
2. The `replace` method on strings is used incorrectly. It replaces all occurrences of a character at once, which would not work correctly for decoding.
3. The logic for mapping characters is incorrect. The function does not correctly handle the symmetry property of the encoding process.

To correctly decode the string, the function should:
1. Identify the unique characters in the encoded string and sort them to form the `r` string.
2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
3. Use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = decode(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def decode(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    r = unique_chars[::-1]  # Reverse the sorted unique characters to get the 'r' string
    mapping = {r[i]: unique_chars[i] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}  # Create the mapping
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)  # Decode the string using the mapping
```

This corrected function properly decodes the encoded string by using a mapping based on the symmetric property of the encoding process.
