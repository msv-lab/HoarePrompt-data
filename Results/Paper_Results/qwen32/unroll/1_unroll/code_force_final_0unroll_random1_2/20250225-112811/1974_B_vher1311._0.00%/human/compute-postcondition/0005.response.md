Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a list of strings. Each string in the list consists of lowercase Latin letters and has a length between 1 and 200,000. The length of the list `s` is between 1 and 10,000, and the total length of all strings combined does not exceed 200,000. The function returns a single string that is the concatenation of all unique strings from the initial list `s` in the order they were first encountered.**
