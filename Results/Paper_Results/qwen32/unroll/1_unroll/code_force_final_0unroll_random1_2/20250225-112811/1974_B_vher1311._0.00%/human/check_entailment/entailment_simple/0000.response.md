Reasoning:  
The provided program logic does not correctly perform the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Unique Characters Extraction and Sorting**:
   - The program correctly extracts the unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `r`.

2. **Symmetric Replacement**:
   - The program's intention seems to be to replace each character in `b` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`. However, the implementation is incorrect.
   - The logic in the loop attempts to replace each character in `b` with the corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` but does so incorrectly by modifying the string `s` directly inside the loop, which leads to incorrect replacements.
   - The `replace` method replaces all occurrences of a character in the string, which is not the desired behavior. Instead, it should replace each character one by one based on its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

3. **Building the Decoded String**:
   - The program incorrectly returns the `unique_chars` list joined as a string, which is not the decoded original string `s`.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    char_to_symmetric = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(char_to_symmetric[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

This corrected function:
- Creates a mapping from each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric counterpart.
- Constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `s` with its mapped symmetric character.

Correctness: **False**
