The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it depends on the result of `int(input())`. To ensure that the loop executes, `int(input())` must return a value greater than or equal to 1. Given the context, this value corresponds to `t`, the number of test cases.

Since the problem states that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, we need to ensure that `t` is within this range for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 before the loop starts and will increment with each iteration.

To summarize, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is at least 1, which means `int(input())` should return a value within the valid range for `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
