The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of elements in a list `a` and `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`. The list `a` contains `n` distinct integers, each between 1 and 10^9. The function processes these inputs and returns an output for each test case based on the provided constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. It processes these inputs and returns an output for each test case.**
