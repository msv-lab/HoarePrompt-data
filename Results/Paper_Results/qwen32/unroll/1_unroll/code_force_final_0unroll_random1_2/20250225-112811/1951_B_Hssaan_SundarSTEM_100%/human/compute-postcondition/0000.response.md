The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which is the number of iterations for the loop. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. If this value is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Given the problem statement, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, which means the loop will execute at least once if `t` is provided as input.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should ensure that the input value `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already described as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, no further adjustment to `t` is needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
