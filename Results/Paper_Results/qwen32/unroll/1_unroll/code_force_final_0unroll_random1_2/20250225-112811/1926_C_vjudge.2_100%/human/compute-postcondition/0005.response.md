In the given for loop, the loop variable is `_` and the range is `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. 

The variables `N` and `pd` are mentioned in the state before the loop starts, but they are not part of the loop head, so we cannot adjust them to ensure the loop executes. The only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

Since `t` is the number of test cases and it is given that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. The initial state of `t` being within this range already ensures that the loop will execute.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute. The state remains as provided.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); `N` is 200001; `pd` is a list where `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of all previous `pd` values plus the sum of the digits of each number from 1 to `i`.**
