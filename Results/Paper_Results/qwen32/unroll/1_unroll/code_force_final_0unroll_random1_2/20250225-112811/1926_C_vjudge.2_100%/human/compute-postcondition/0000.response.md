Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes on the board for that test case; `N` is 200001.**

Explanation: The value of `N` is set to 200001, as it is assigned the result of `int(2 * 100000.0) + 1`. The initial state of the input variables `t` and `n` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
