The code snippet provided is `t = int(input())`, which reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases.

Given the initial state, `t` was not previously defined, and now it is assigned the value from the input. The other variables (`n` and `N`) remain unchanged as they are not mentioned in the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); `N` is 200001.**
