To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic implemented in `func_1(a, b)` and how it relates to the problem description.

The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns playing with their wallets, and the player who cannot make a valid move loses. The key insight here is that the game can be reduced to the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins `a + b`.

The strategy is as follows:
- If the total number of coins `a + b` is even, then Bob wins.
- If the total number of coins `a + b` is odd, then Alice wins.

This is because:
- If the total number of coins is even, Alice will always be faced with an even number of coins after her turn, and Bob can always mirror Alice's moves to ensure he wins.
- If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even number of coins, ensuring Alice's win.

The implementation in `func_1(a, b)` correctly checks the parity of the total number of coins and returns the correct winner based on the above strategy.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Your response:
Correctness: **True**
