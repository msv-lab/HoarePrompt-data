Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify if the logic implemented in the functions aligns with the problem description.

The game is described as a turn-based game where Alice and Bob take turns to either swap their wallets or not, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally.

The critical insight is the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins (a + b). The problem hints at this by providing examples where the winner is determined based on whether the total number of coins is odd or even.

The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins:
- If the sum of coins (a + b) is even, Bob wins.
- If the sum of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice wins.

This aligns with the optimal strategy for both players. When the total number of coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he is the last one to make a move. Conversely, when the total number of coins is odd, Alice can force Bob into a position where Bob will eventually be unable to make a move.

The function `func_2()` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases, reading the number of coins for each test case, and using `func_1()` to determine the winner. It then prints the result for each test case.

Since both functions together correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
