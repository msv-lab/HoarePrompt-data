### Reasoning:

The problem is essentially about determining the winner of a game based on the parity (odd or even) of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the sum of the coins is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This is because the game revolves around the players taking turns reducing the number of coins, and the player who is forced to make a move when the total number of coins is zero loses. Given that both players play optimally, the game's outcome is solely dependent on whether the total number of coins is odd or even.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates `t` times to read pairs of integers (`a` and `b`), representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

2. **Logic in `func_1`**: The function `func_1(a, b)` calculates the sum of `a` and `b`. It then checks if this sum is even or odd:
   - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, the sum is even, and `func_1` returns `'Bob'`.
   - Otherwise, the sum is odd, and `func_1` returns `'Alice'`.

3. **Output**: The results from `func_1` are collected in a list and printed one by one, corresponding to each test case.

The given example inputs and outputs in the problem statement align with the logic implemented in the program. For instance:
- For the input `1 1`, the sum is `2` (even), so the output is `'Bob'`.
- For the input `1 4`, the sum is `5` (odd), so the output is `'Alice'`.

Thus, the program correctly determines the winner based on the described rules and handles multiple test cases as required.
