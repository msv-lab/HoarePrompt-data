Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an array `a` of `n` integers and `q` queries. Each query asks whether there exists a subarray within the specified range `[l, r]` such that the XOR of all its elements is zero. The function outputs "YES" if such a subarray exists and "NO" otherwise, for each query. The results for each test case are printed sequentially, with an empty line separating the results of different test cases.**
