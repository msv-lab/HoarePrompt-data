You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

    #This is printed: Result1\nResult2\n\nResult3\nResult4\n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an array `a` of `n` integers and `q` queries. Each query asks whether there exists a subarray within the specified range `[l, r]` such that the XOR of all its elements is zero. The function outputs "YES" if such a subarray exists and "NO" otherwise, for each query. The results for each test case are printed sequentially, with an empty line separating the results of different test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given problem requires determining if a subarray can be split into more than one segment such that the bitwise XOR of each segment is equal.

The provided solution uses a prefix XOR array (`pf`) and a dictionary (`mp`) that maps prefix XOR values to their indices. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The prefix XOR array `pf` is built such that `pf[i]` is the result of XORing all elements from the start of the array up to the `i-th` element.
   - `pf[0]` is initialized to 0, and for each subsequent element `a[i]`, `pf[i] = pf[i-1] ^ a[i]`.

2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**:
   - A dictionary `mp` is used to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs. This helps in quickly finding all positions where a particular prefix XOR value has been seen.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` is calculated as `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
   - If `x` is 0, it means the entire subarray can be considered as one segment with XOR 0, hence it is "interesting".
   - Otherwise, the solution attempts to find if there are indices in `mp[pf[r]]` and `mp[pf[l-1]]` such that a valid split is possible. The use of binary search (`bisect_left`) helps in efficiently finding the relevant indices.
   - If such indices exist, it means there is a way to split the subarray into two or more segments with equal XOR, and the answer is "YES". Otherwise, it's "NO".

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Prefix XOR**:
  - The prefix XOR array correctly represents the cumulative XOR up to each position in the array.
  
- **Efficiency of Query Processing**:
  - By leveraging the prefix XOR and binary search, the solution efficiently checks if a valid split exists for each query, without having to explicitly try all possible splits.

- **Handling Edge Cases**:
  - The solution correctly handles cases where the XOR of the entire subarray is 0.
  - It also correctly uses binary search to find relevant indices in the prefix XOR dictionary, ensuring that the solution works within the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution is correct and efficiently handles the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: True**
