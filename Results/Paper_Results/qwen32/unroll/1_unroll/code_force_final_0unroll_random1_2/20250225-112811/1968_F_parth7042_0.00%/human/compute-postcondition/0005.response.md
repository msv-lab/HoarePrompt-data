The only variable in the loop head is `_` in the `for _ in range(t):` statement, which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `idx` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
