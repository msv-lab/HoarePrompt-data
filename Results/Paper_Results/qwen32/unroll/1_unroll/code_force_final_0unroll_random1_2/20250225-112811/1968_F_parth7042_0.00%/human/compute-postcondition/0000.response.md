The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. The variables `t`, `n`, `q`, and the elements of the array `a` are not explicitly assigned values in the given code, but `data` will hold the split input values.

Given the initial state, `data` will be a list of strings containing the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and potentially the elements of `a` and the query pairs `l` and `r`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. The array `a` contains `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
