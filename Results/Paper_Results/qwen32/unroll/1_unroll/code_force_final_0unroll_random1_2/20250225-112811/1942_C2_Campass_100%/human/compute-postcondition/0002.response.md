In the given code snippet, the `while` loop condition is `while t:`. This loop will execute as long as `t` is a non-zero value. Since `t` is described as an integer read from input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it is guaranteed to be a non-zero value initially. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to ensure that the loop can execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and converts each component to an integer.**
