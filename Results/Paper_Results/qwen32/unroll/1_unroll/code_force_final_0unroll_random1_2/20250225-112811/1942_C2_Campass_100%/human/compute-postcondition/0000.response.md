The code snippet provided defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and converts each component to an integer. This lambda function is not used in the provided snippet but is defined for future use in reading input values.

Given the initial state, no variables are directly modified by the provided code snippet. The lambda function `R` is defined, but it does not execute and thus does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or the list of vertices.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and converts each component to an integer.**
