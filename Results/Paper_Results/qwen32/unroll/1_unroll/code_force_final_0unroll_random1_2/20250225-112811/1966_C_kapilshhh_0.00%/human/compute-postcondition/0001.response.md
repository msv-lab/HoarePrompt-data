To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `tc > 0` is satisfied. The variables `t` and `tc` are the ones in the loop head, and we can only adjust these.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, this variable does not affect the condition `tc > 0` directly. Therefore, we only need to adjust `tc` to ensure that it is greater than 0.

Since `tc` is an input integer, we need to state that `tc` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tc` must be greater than 0**
