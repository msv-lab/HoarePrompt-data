Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of cities, a list `a` of `n` distinct integers in ascending order representing the positions of the cities, and an integer `m` representing the number of queries. Each query consists of two integers `x_i` and `y_i` representing the indices of two different cities. The function returns the closest city to each queried city, excluding the city itself, for each query.**
