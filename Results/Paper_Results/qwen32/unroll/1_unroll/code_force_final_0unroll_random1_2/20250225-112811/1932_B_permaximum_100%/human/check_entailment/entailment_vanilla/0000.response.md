Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding:
The Chaya tribe believes in a series of signs, each occurring at regular intervals. The i-th sign occurs every a_i years. The signs must occur in sequence, meaning the next sign can only occur after the previous one has occurred. Our task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given the periodicities of the signs for multiple test cases.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - It initializes `current_year` to 0, representing the starting year.
   - For each sign's periodicity `ai`:
     - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence is exactly `ai` years later.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the next occurrence as the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`.
     - It then updates `current_year` to this next occurrence year.
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `current_year` to the results list.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

### Verification:
Let's verify the logic using the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Signs: `[3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - Year 3: First sign occurs.
   - Year 4: Second sign occurs (next multiple of 2 after 3).
   - Year 8: Third sign occurs (next multiple of 4 after 4).
   - Year 10: Fourth sign occurs (next multiple of 5 after 8).
   - Year 18: Fifth sign occurs (next multiple of 9 after 10).
   - Year 36: Sixth sign occurs (next multiple of 18 after 18).
   - **Result: 36**

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Signs: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Year 1: First sign occurs.
   - Year 2: Second sign occurs.
   - Year 3: Third sign occurs.
   - Year 4: Fourth sign occurs.
   - Year 5: Fifth sign occurs.
   - **Result: 5**

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Signs: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - All signs occur in the first year.
   - **Result: 5**

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Signs: `[50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
   - Year 50: First sign occurs.
   - Year 60: Second sign occurs (next multiple of 30 after 50).
   - Year 760: Third sign occurs (next multiple of 711 after 60).
   - Year 960: Fourth sign occurs (next multiple of 200 after 760).
   - Year 1463: Fifth sign occurs (next multiple of 503 after 960).
   - Year 2012: Sixth sign occurs (next multiple of 1006 after 1463).
   - **Result: 2012**

All the results match the expected output in the problem statement. Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
