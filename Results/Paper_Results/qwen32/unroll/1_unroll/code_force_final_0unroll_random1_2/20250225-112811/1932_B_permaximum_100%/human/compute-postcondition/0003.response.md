Output State: **The program returns a list `results` where each element is the smallest year that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding `a_list` from `test_cases`.**

This means that for each test case in `test_cases`, the program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a_list` and stores this LCM in the `results` list. The final `results` list is then returned.
