To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand what the loop does. For each test case, it calculates the smallest year that is a multiple of all the integers in `a_list`, starting from year 0. This is essentially finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers in `a_list`, but starting from year 0 and incrementing step by step according to the rules provided.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens for each test case:
1. Initialize `current_year` to 0.
2. For each integer `ai` in `a_list`:
   - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next year is `current_year + ai`.
   - If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next year is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
3. After processing all integers in `a_list`, the final `current_year` is appended to the `results` list.

The `results` list will contain the final `current_year` for each test case after the loop completes.

Given the initial state, the output state will be:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, test_cases is a list of t test cases where each test case is represented as a tuple (n, a_list). Here, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a_list is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, results is a list of t integers where each integer is the smallest year that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding a_list.**
