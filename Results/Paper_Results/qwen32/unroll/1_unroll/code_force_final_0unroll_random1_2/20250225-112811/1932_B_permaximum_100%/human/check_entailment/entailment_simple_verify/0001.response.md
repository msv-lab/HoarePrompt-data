### Reasoning:

The original assessment carefully analyzed the problem and the provided code, verifying the logic step-by-step using the example cases. Let's break down the reasoning to ensure the correctness:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given that each sign must occur sequentially and each sign has a specific periodicity.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and the periodicities for each test case.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year based on the current year and the periodicity of the sign.
   - The calculation of the next occurrence year is correctly handled by checking if the current year is a multiple of the periodicity. If not, it calculates the next multiple of the periodicity after the current year.
   - The program accumulates the years correctly for each sign in sequence.

3. **Verification with Example Cases:**
   - The assessment verified the logic using the provided example cases and showed that the results matched the expected output.

4. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations provided additional insights into the state of the program at key points, confirming that the program correctly processes each test case and calculates the correct year for the n-th sign.

### Evaluation:

The annotated code and the step-by-step verification in the original assessment show that the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The example cases were correctly handled, and the annotations support the correctness of the program's behavior.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was accurate, and the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Final: **True**
