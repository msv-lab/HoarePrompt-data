### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given the periodicity of each sign. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the i-th sign must occur after the (i-1)-th sign.

The provided program processes each test case as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`.
3. It initializes `current_year` to 0.
4. For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur:
   - If `current_year` is already a multiple of the sign's periodicity `ai`, the next occurrence is `current_year + ai`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`.
5. It updates `current_year` to the year of the next sign's occurrence.
6. After processing all signs, it stores the final `current_year` (which is the year the n-th sign occurs) in the results list.
7. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The logic in the program correctly implements the sequential occurrence of signs based on their periodicities. The provided example inputs and outputs match the expected behavior of the program.
