In the given task, the for loop iterates over the indices of the list `arr` in reverse order. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function parameters `len(arr) - 1`, `-1`, and `-1`. We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute.

Let's break it down:

1. The loop will execute if `len(arr) - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, meaning `arr` must have at least one element.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to `len(arr) - 1` in the first iteration.
3. The other variables `ans` and `tem` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `arr` has at least one element. The initial value of `i` does not need to be set in the state because it is determined by the range function.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `ans` is an empty list; `tem` is 1**
