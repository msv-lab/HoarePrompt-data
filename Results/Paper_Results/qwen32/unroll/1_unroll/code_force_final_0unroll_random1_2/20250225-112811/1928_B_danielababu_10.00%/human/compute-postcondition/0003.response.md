To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the provided code step by step:

The initial state is:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `tem` is `1`.

The loop iterates over the indices of `arr` in reverse order (from the last index to the first index). For each iteration, it multiplies the current value of `tem` by the element at the current index of `arr` and appends the result to `ans`.

Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose `arr` is `[2, 3, 4]`.

1. **Iteration 1 (i = 2)**:
   - `tem` is `1`.
   - `tem *= arr[2]` → `tem = 1 * 4 = 4`.
   - `ans.append(tem)` → `ans = [4]`.

2. **Iteration 2 (i = 1)**:
   - `tem` is `4`.
   - `tem *= arr[1]` → `tem = 4 * 3 = 12`.
   - `ans.append(tem)` → `ans = [4, 12]`.

3. **Iteration 3 (i = 0)**:
   - `tem` is `12`.
   - `tem *= arr[0]` → `tem = 12 * 2 = 24`.
   - `ans.append(tem)` → `ans = [4, 12, 24]`.

After the loop completes, the final state is:
- `arr` remains `[2, 3, 4]`.
- `ans` is `[4, 12, 24]`.
- `tem` is `24`.

In general, `ans` will contain the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` in reverse order, starting from the last element and moving to the first.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `ans` is a list of cumulative products of `arr` in reverse order; `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.**
