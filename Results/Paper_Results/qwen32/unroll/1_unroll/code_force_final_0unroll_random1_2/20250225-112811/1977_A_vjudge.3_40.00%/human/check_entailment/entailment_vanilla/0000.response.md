Let's analyze the problem and the given code to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

Nikita can perform two types of moves:
1. Add exactly 1 cube to the tower.
2. Remove exactly 1 cube from the tower.

We need to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, starting from 0 cubes.

### Key Observations:

1. **Parity of Moves and Result:**
   - If `n` (number of moves) is even, then the final number of cubes `m` must also be even. This is because each pair of moves (add and remove) results in no net change in the number of cubes, or two adds result in an even increase, or two removes result in an even decrease.
   - If `n` is odd, then the final number of cubes `m` must also be odd. This is because an odd number of moves will result in either an odd increase (if more adds than removes) or an odd decrease (if more removes than adds).

2. **Range of Possible Values:**
   - The minimum number of cubes after `n` moves is `0` (if all moves are removes and we start from 0).
   - The maximum number of cubes after `n` moves is `n` (if all moves are adds).

### Code Analysis:

Let's break down the code to see if it aligns with the above observations:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

- The code correctly handles the case where `n == m` (direct match).
- It correctly handles the case where `m > n` (impossible to have more cubes than moves).
- It correctly handles the case where `m == n - 1` (possible if the last move is a remove after `n` adds).
- The code then checks the parity of `m` and `n`:
  - If both are even, it prints 'Yes'.
  - If both are odd, it prints 'Yes'.
  - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues in the Code:

- **Missing Parity Check for `m < n - 1`:** The code doesn't handle cases where `m < n - 1` and the parity matches. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 1`, the code will incorrectly print 'No' because it doesn't consider the possibility of reaching `m` through a combination of adds and removes that results in the correct parity.

### Conclusion:

The code fails to correctly handle all possible cases, specifically cases where `m < n - 1` and the parity of `m` and `n` matches. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
