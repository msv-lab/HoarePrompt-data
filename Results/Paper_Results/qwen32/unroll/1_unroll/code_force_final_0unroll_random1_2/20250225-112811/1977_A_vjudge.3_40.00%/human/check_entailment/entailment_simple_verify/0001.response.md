### Reasoning:

Let's thoroughly analyze the problem and the given code to determine its correctness.

### Problem Recap:

Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move. Starting from zero cubes, we need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Observations:

1. **Parity of Moves and Result:**
   - If `n` (number of moves) is even, then the final number of cubes `m` must also be even. This is because an even number of moves can result in no net change, an even increase, or an even decrease.
   - If `n` is odd, then the final number of cubes `m` must also be odd. This is because an odd number of moves will result in either an odd increase or an odd decrease.

2. **Range of Possible Values:**
   - The minimum number of cubes after `n` moves is `0` (if all moves are removes and we start from 0).
   - The maximum number of cubes after `n` moves is `n` (if all moves are adds).

### Code Analysis:

Let's break down the code to see if it aligns with the above observations:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

- **Case `n == m`:** This is correct. If the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it's possible to end up with `m` cubes by adding one cube per move.
- **Case `m > n`:** This is correct. It's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
- **Case `m == n - 1`:** This is correct. If the number of cubes is one less than the number of moves, it's possible by adding cubes until the second-to-last move and then removing one cube.
- **Parity Check `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`:** This is correct. If both `m` and `n` are even, it's possible to reach `m` cubes.
- **Parity Check `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`:** This is correct. If both `m` and `n` are odd, it's possible to reach `m` cubes.
- **Else Case:** This is correct for cases where the parity does not match, and `m` is not `n - 1`.

### Issues in the Code:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the code does not handle all cases where `m < n - 1` and the parity matches. However, let's re-evaluate if there are any other issues.

1. **Handling `m < n - 1` with Matching Parity:**
   - The code does not explicitly handle this case, but the parity checks cover it indirectly.
   - For `m < n - 1`, if `m` and `n` have the same parity, it's possible to reach `m` by a combination of adds and removes. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 1`, the sequence can be: add, add, add, remove, remove.

### Conclusion:

The code correctly handles all cases by leveraging the parity checks and specific conditions. The original assessment incorrectly states that the code fails to handle some cases, but this is not true based on the provided logic.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
