You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and k such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The sum of n over all tuples in cases does not exceed 10^7.

    #The program returns a list of tuples where each tuple is (25, sequence) repeated for each case in `cases`. Each `sequence` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216].
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of cases, and `cases`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k`. For each tuple in `cases`, the function generates a tuple `(25, sequence)` and appends it to a results list. The `sequence` is a predefined list of the first 25 powers of 2 starting from 2^0 up to 2^24. The function returns the results list containing these tuples for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to generate a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
2. For all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

The provided program generates a sequence of 25 elements, each being a power of 2, and returns this sequence for every test case. Let's verify if this sequence meets the problem's requirements.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the input and parses the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then reads the pairs of integers `(n, k)` for each test case.

2. **Sequence Generation:**
   - The program generates a sequence of 25 elements where each element is a power of 2: `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^24]`.
   - This sequence is used for all test cases.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
     - Since the sequence consists of powers of 2, any sum of a subset of these numbers is a unique binary number.
     - If `k` is a power of 2, it is directly in the sequence, and thus can be formed by a subsequence.
     - If `k` is not a power of 2, it can still be formed as a sum of a subset of the sequence. Therefore, this sequence does not guarantee that no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - **Condition 2:** For all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.
     - This condition is satisfied because any number `v` can be represented in binary form, and the sequence of powers of 2 allows us to form any number up to `2^25 - 1` (which is much larger than any possible `n` in the problem).
     - However, as mentioned above, this condition alone is not enough to ensure that `k` cannot be formed.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not guarantee that there is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k` because the sequence of powers of 2 can form any number that is a sum of distinct powers of 2, including `k` if `k` is a sum of such powers.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem's requirements.
