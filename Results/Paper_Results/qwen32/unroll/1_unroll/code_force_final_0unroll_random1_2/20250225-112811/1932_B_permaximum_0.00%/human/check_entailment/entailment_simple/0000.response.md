### Reasoning:
The program is designed to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse occurs based on the periodicities of each sign. The key logic is to iteratively calculate the year in which each sign occurs, starting from year 0 and adding the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than the current year.

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Initialization**: The variable `year` is initialized to 0, representing the starting point.
2. **Iterate through each sign**: For each sign's periodicity `ai`:
   - The expression `year % ai or ai` is evaluated:
     - `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`. If `year % ai` is non-zero, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, and we need to find the next multiple of `ai` that is greater than `year`.
     - If `year % ai` is zero, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so we simply add `ai` to move to the next occurrence.
     - The `or` operator ensures that if `year % ai` is zero (i.e., `year` is already a multiple of `ai`), `ai` is added, otherwise, `year % ai` is added to `year` to reach the next multiple of `ai`.
3. **Update `year`**: The `year` is updated to the next occurrence of the current sign.
4. **Output the final year**: After processing all signs, the final value of `year` is printed, which represents the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

The logic correctly calculates the year for each sign in sequence, ensuring that each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens. It handles all edge cases and adheres to the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
