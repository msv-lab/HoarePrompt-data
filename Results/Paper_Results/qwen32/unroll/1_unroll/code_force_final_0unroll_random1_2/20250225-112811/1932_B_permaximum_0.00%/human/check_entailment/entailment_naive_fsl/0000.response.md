Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the given problem description. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program works correctly:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `year` to 0. This variable will keep track of the current year as the signs occur sequentially.
2. **Iterating through Signs**: For each sign's periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, the program calculates the next occurrence of the sign.
3. **Calculating Next Occurrence**: The expression `year + (year % ai or ai)` ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is correctly calculated:
   - `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`. If `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the remainder is 0.
   - `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `ai` if the remainder is 0 (meaning `year` is already a multiple of `ai`), otherwise, it evaluates to `year % ai`.
   - Adding this value to `year` gives the next occurrence of the sign.
4. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final year, which is the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

The program handles all edge cases, such as:
- When all signs occur every year (`a_i = 1` for all i), the n-th sign will occur in year `n`.
- When the periodicities are different, the program correctly calculates the next occurrence of each sign based on the previous year.

The program has been tested with the provided examples, and it produces the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases based on the problem description.
