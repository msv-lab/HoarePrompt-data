Let's analyze the given problem, the provided code, and the annotations to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning after the i-th sign occurs, the tribe waits for the (i+1)-th sign to occur starting from the year immediately after the i-th sign.

### Code Analysis
Here is the code provided with annotations:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)
```
#### Annotations:
- **State before the function call**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\).
- **State inside the loop**: `year` is initialized to 0. For each `ai` in the list `a`, `year` is updated using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.
- **State after the loop**: The final value of `year` is printed, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment claims that the program is correct. It explains that:
1. `year` is initialized to 0.
2. For each sign's periodicity `ai`, the program calculates the next occurrence of the sign using `year += year % ai or ai`.
3. This ensures that the next occurrence is correctly calculated based on the previous year.
4. The program handles edge cases and produces the correct output for the provided examples.

### Detailed Reasoning
Let's break down the logic of `year += year % ai or ai`:
- `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`.
- If `year % ai` is 0, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so the next occurrence should be `year + ai`.
- If `year % ai` is non-zero, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, so the next occurrence should be `year + (ai - (year % ai))`, which simplifies to `year + ai - (year % ai)`.
- The expression `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `ai` if `year % ai` is 0, otherwise it evaluates to `year % ai`. Adding this to `year` effectively calculates the next occurrence of the sign.

However, the expression `year += year % ai or ai` does not correctly calculate the next occurrence of the sign. The correct expression should be:
- `year += ai - (year % ai)` if `year % ai` is non-zero, otherwise `year += ai`.
- This can be simplified to `year = (year // ai + 1) * ai` for any `year`.

The given expression `year += year % ai or ai` does not handle the case correctly. For example, if `year` is 3 and `ai` is 2, the expression evaluates to `year += 1` (since `year % ai` is 1), but it should be `year += 1` to reach the next multiple of 2, which is 4.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur. The logic in the expression `year += year % ai or ai` is flawed.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
