Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the given periodicities and the sequential requirement of the signs. Here's a brief explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`.
3. It initializes a variable `year` to 0, representing the starting point.
4. For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`:
   - It calculates the next occurrence of the sign after the current `year` by adding the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `year + 1`. This is achieved by `year + (year % ai or ai)`. If `year % ai` is 0, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so the next occurrence is in `year + ai`. Otherwise, it adds the difference to reach the next multiple of `ai`.
5. It prints the final `year` after processing all signs for that test case.

The logic correctly follows the problem's requirement that each sign must occur strictly after the previous one, and the solution is efficient given the constraints.
