Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. Here are some issues with the logic:

1. **Handling of Gaps**: The logic for handling gaps between chosen vertices is flawed. The program sorts the gaps and then tries to fill them with the available `y` vertices, but it does not properly account for the fact that adding vertices can create new gaps and triangles.

2. **Counting Triangles**: The initial value of `ans` is set to `x - 2`, which assumes that the chosen vertices form a single polygonal chain. However, this is incorrect because the vertices can form multiple disconnected chains or even isolated vertices, and each chain can form its own set of triangles.

3. **Non-Intersecting Diagonals**: The program does not ensure that the diagonals are non-intersecting. The logic for adding vertices and counting triangles does not take into account the possibility of intersections.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the vertices form a single triangle or where the additional vertices can form new triangles that were not initially considered.

A correct approach would involve a more sophisticated algorithm that considers the structure of the chosen vertices, the gaps between them, and the possibility of adding vertices to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles. This might involve dynamic programming or a greedy approach with careful consideration of the constraints and the geometry of the problem.
