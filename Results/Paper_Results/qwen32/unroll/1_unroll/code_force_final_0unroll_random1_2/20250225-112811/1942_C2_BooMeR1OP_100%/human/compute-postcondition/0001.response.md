The only variable in the loop head of the given for loop is `_`, which is a common throwaway variable used when the loop variable is not needed. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of iterations specified.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9
- `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5)
- `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`
- The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

Since the loop only depends on `t`, and the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices do not affect the execution of the loop itself, we only need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for `n`, `x`, `y`, or the list of vertices. The only requirement is that `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`, and the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`**
