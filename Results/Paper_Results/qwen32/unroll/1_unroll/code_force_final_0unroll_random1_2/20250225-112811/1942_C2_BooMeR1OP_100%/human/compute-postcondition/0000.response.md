Output State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`) and their constraints remain unchanged as they have not been modified by the code snippet provided.
