Output State: **The program returns the number of unique elements that do not have a corresponding bitwise complement in the list `a`.**

This means that `res` holds the count of unique integers in the list `a` for which there is no other integer in `a` such that their bitwise XOR equals -1 (or equivalently, their bitwise AND equals 0 when considering the full 32-bit range for non-negative integers).
