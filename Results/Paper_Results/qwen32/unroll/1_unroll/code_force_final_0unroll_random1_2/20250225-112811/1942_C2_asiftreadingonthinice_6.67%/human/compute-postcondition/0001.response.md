The only variable in the loop head of the given for loop is `ii` and the range it iterates over is `tt`. Therefore, the only states we can adjust are `ii` and `tt` to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, `tt` must be at least 1. The initial value of `ii` before the loop starts does not affect whether the loop will execute, as it will be set to 0 at the start of the first iteration. However, for the sake of clarity and completeness, we can specify that `ii` should be 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`tt` must be greater than or equal to 1, `ii` is 0**
