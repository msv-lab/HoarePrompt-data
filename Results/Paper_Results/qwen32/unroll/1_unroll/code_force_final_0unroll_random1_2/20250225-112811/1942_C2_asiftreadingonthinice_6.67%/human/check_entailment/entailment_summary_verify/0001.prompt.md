You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the number of vertices `n`, the number of chosen vertices `x`, the available adjustments `y`, and the list of chosen vertices. The result is the minimum of a calculated value and `n - 2`, representing a specific property related to the chosen vertices and their arrangement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing up to `y` additional vertices from a regular `n`-sided polygon, given that `x` vertices have already been chosen.

### Key Points:
1. **Vertices and Diagonals**: We need to form triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals between the chosen vertices.
2. **Maximizing Triangles**: The strategy should focus on maximizing the number of triangles that can be formed.
3. **Constraints**: The number of additional vertices we can choose is `y`, and the total number of vertices is `n`. The vertices are numbered from 1 to `n` in a clockwise manner.

### Program Analysis:
Let's walk through the provided program and see if it correctly addresses the problem:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` followed by the list of `x` chosen vertices.
2. **Sorting**: The list of chosen vertices `a` is sorted to facilitate the calculation of gaps between consecutive vertices.
3. **Initial Triangles**: The program initializes the answer `ans` to `x + y - 2`. This is based on the idea that each additional vertex can potentially form additional triangles.
4. **Gap Calculation**: The program iterates over the sorted list of vertices to calculate gaps between consecutive vertices. If the gap is 2, it means we can form an additional triangle without needing extra vertices. If the gap is even and greater than 2, the program calculates how many triangles can be formed by adding vertices in the middle of the gap.
5. **Circular Gap**: The program also checks the gap between the first and last vertex considering the circular nature of the polygon.
6. **Remaining Vertices**: The program adds any remaining vertices to the answer.
7. **Output**: The program outputs the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`, which is the maximum number of triangles possible in a polygon with `n` sides.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Circular Gap Calculation**: There is a mistake in the circular gap calculation. The program incorrectly uses `a[i] - a[i - 1]` instead of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` in the `y` decrement calculation.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program might not handle edge cases properly, especially when `x` is close to `n` or when `y` is 0.

### Correctness:
Given the identified issues, particularly the mistake in the circular gap calculation, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct result for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
Reasoning: The program has a logical error in the calculation of the circular gap and might not handle edge cases correctly.
Correctness: **False**
