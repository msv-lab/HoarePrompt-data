Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the number of vertices `n`, the number of chosen vertices `x`, the available adjustments `y`, and the list of chosen vertices. The result is the minimum of a calculated value and `n - 2`, representing a specific property related to the chosen vertices and their arrangement.**
