Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, followed by a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident wants to live on the right side. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input. The other variables (`n` and `a`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.
