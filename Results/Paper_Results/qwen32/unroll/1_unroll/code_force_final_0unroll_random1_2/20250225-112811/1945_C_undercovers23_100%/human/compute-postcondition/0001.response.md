The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5), `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'**
