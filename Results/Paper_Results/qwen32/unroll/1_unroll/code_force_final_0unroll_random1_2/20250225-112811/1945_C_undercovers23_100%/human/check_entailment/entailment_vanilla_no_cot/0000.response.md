Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the main problems:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `pk`**: The variable `pk` is calculated as `n / 2` regardless of whether `n` is even or odd. This is correct, but the code unnecessarily checks if `n` is even or odd to set `pk`. It can be simplified to `pk = n // 2` since integer division in Python will handle both cases correctly.

2. **Percentage Calculation**: The program calculates percentages (`zero_perc` and `one_perc`) and checks if they are greater than or equal to 50. However, the problem requires checking if the number of residents on each side is at least the ceiling of half the number of residents on that side. The percentage calculation is not appropriate here.

3. **Incorrect Condition for Valid Positions**: The condition `if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50` is incorrect. Instead, the program should check if the number of zeros on the left is at least `ceil(i / 2)` and the number of ones on the right is at least `ceil((n - i) / 2)`. This can be done using integer arithmetic as `zero >= (i + 1) // 2` and `one >= (n - i - 1 + 1) // 2`.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle the edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house (position 0) or after the last house (position n). These cases need to be checked separately.

5. **Final Selection Logic**: The final selection logic to find the position closest to `pk` and break ties by choosing the smaller position is mostly correct but the handling of the edge cases is not properly addressed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        o = s.count('1')
        z = s.count('0')
        zero, one = 0, 0
        best_i = -1
        min_diff = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i == n:
                left_zeros = zero
                left_ones = one
                right_zeros = z - left_zeros
                right_ones = o - left_ones
            else:
                if s[i] == '0':
                    zero += 1
                else:
                    one += 1
                left_zeros = zero
                left_ones = one
                right_zeros = z - left_zeros
                right_ones = o - left_ones
            
            if left_zeros >= (i + 1) // 2 and right_ones >= (n - i) // 2:
                diff = abs(i - n // 2)
                if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and i < best_i):
                    min_diff = diff
                    best_i = i
        
        print(best_i)

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the conditions and edge cases, ensuring that the road is placed in the optimal position.
