In the given task, we need to adjust the state before the for loop starts such that the loop can execute. The loop head contains `range(int(sys.stdin.readline()))`, which means the loop will execute based on the integer value read from `sys.stdin`.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. `sys.stdin.readline()` will read a line from the input, which should be a string representation of an integer.
2. This string should be convertible to an integer.
3. The integer value should be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given that there are no variables present in the function signature of `func_1`, we can only adjust the state related to `sys.stdin`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. We need to simulate the input such that `sys.stdin.readline()` returns a string that can be converted to an integer.
2. The integer should be greater than or equal to 1 to ensure the loop executes.

### Adjustment:

- Simulate `sys.stdin.readline()` to return a string that can be converted to an integer.
- Ensure the integer is greater than or equal to 1.

### Example State:

To ensure the loop executes, we can simulate `sys.stdin.readline()` to return the string `"1"`, which is a valid integer and will make the loop execute once.

State: **`sys.stdin.readline()` returns `"1"`**
