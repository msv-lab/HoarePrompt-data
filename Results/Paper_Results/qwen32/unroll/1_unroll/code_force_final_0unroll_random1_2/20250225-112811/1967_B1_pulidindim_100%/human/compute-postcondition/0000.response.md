The provided code snippet reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases, and it is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The preconditions for `n` and `m` in each test case remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. Additionally, the sum of all `n` and the sum of all `m` across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.**
