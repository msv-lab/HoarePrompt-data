Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its logic against the problem requirements. The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:

1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The provided program initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`. It then iterates through values of `count` up to `m`, calculating the number of valid pairs for each `count`. However, the logic for counting valid pairs is flawed.

Let's break down the provided program and the logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Initialization:**
   - `count` is initialized to 2.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`, which counts the number of pairs where \(b = 1\).

2. **Loop through values of `count`:**
   - The loop runs from `count = 2` to `m`.
   - For each `count`, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`.
   - It calculates `g` as `int(n / count)`, which represents the number of multiples of `count` up to `n`.
   - It then subtracts `countmins` from `g` to get the number of valid values of `a` for the current `b = count`.
   - It adds `int(g / count) + 1` to `ans`.

### Flaws in the Program

- The logic for counting valid pairs is not correctly implemented. The program does not correctly iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is satisfied.
- The program assumes that the number of valid pairs for a given `b` can be calculated using the formula `int(g / count) + 1`, which is not correct.
- The program does not handle all cases correctly, as demonstrated by the original assessment.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is satisfied. A more correct approach would involve nested loops to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and count the valid pairs.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly compute the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions as described in the problem statement. The logic for counting valid pairs is flawed.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
