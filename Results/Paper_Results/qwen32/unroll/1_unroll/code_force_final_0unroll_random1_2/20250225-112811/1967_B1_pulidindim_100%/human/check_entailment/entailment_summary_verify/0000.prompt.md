You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, performs a series of calculations, and prints a result based on these values. The function processes each test case independently and does not retain any state between them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and the problem requirements.

The problem requires finding pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The given program initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`. It then iterates through values of `count` up to `m`, calculating the number of valid pairs for each `count`. However, the logic for counting valid pairs is incorrect.

Let's consider a simple test case to demonstrate the error:
- Input: `n = 3, m = 3`
- Expected Output: `4`
- Explanation of expected output:
  - Valid pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1)
  - For (1,1): \(1 + 1 = 2\) which is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1,1) = 1\)
  - For (2,1): \(2 + 1 = 3\) which is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2,1) = 1\)
  - For (2,2): \(2 + 2 = 4\) which is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2,2) = 2\)
  - For (3,1): \(3 + 1 = 4\) which is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(3,1) = 1\)

Now, let's see what the provided program outputs for this test case:
- The program initializes `ans` to `n = 3`.
- It then starts the loop with `count = 2`:
  - For `count = 2`, it calculates `countmins = 1`, `g = int(3 / 2) = 1`, and `g -= countmins` results in `g = 0`.
  - It then adds `int(0 / 2) + 1` to `ans`, which is `1`.
  - The new value of `ans` is `4`.
- For `count = 3`, it calculates `countmins = 2`, `g = int(3 / 3) = 1`, and `g -= countmins` results in `g = -1`.
  - Since `g < countmins`, the loop breaks.
- The final value of `ans` is `4`, which seems correct for this test case, but let's consider another test case to see if the logic holds.

Let's consider another test case:
- Input: `n = 10, m = 8`
- Expected Output: `14`
- Explanation of expected output:
  - Valid pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)

Now, let's see what the provided program outputs for this test case:
- The program initializes `ans` to `n = 10`.
- It then starts the loop with `count = 2`:
  - For `count = 2`, it calculates `countmins = 1`, `g = int(10 / 2) = 5`, and `g -= countmins` results in `g = 4`.
  - It then adds `int(4 / 2) + 1` to `ans`, which is `3`.
  - The new value of `ans` is `13`.
- For `count = 3`, it calculates `countmins = 2`, `g = int(10 / 3) = 3`, and `g -= countmins` results in `g = 1`.
  - It then adds `int(1 / 3) + 1` to `ans`, which is `1`.
  - The new value of `ans` is `14`.
- For `count = 4`, it calculates `countmins = 3`, `g = int(10 / 4) = 2`, and `g -= countmins` results in `g = -1`.
  - Since `g < countmins`, the loop breaks.
- The final value of `ans` is `14`, which is correct for this test case, but the logic is still suspect.

However, the provided program does not correctly handle all cases, and the logic for counting valid pairs is flawed. The program does not correctly iterate through all possible pairs (a, b) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is satisfied.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the correct answer is:
Correctness: **False**.
