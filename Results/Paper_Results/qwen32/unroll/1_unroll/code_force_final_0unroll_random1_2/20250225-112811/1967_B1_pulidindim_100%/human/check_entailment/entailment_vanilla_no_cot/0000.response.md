To determine the correctness of the given program, let's carefully analyze whether it correctly solves the problem as described.

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The provided program seems to have an incorrect logic for counting the valid pairs. Let's break down the program and compare it to the problem requirements.

### Program Analysis:

1. The program reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
3. It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`.
4. It enters a loop that continues while `count` is less than or equal to `m`.
5. Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1` and `g` as `n // count`.
6. If `g` is less than `countmins`, it breaks out of the loop.
7. Otherwise, it updates `g` by subtracting `countmins` and adds `g // count + 1` to `ans`.
8. It increments `count` by 1.
9. Finally, it prints `ans`.

### Issues with the Program:

- The program does not correctly implement the logic to check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is incorrect since it does not account for pairs where \(b > 1\).
- The loop and the calculations inside the loop do not correctly enumerate and check all pairs \((a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
