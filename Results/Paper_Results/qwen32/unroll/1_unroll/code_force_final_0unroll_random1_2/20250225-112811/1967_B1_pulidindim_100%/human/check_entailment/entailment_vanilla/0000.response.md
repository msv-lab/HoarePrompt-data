Let's analyze the provided Python program and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

### Program Analysis
The given program seems to attempt to solve the problem in a loop over possible values of `b` (denoted as `count` in the program). Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read.
   - `count` is initialized to 2 (since `b` starts from 1, and the loop starts from 2).
   - `ans` is initialized to `n` (since every pair (a, 1) is valid because gcd(a, 1) = 1 and a + 1 is always a multiple of 1).

2. **Loop over `b`**:
   - The loop runs while `count` (representing `b`) is less than or equal to `m`.
   - `countmins` is calculated as `count - 1`.
   - `g` is calculated as `n // count` (integer division).
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks (this is a condition to stop further iterations).
   - `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
   - `ans` is incremented by `g // count + 1`.
   - `count` is incremented by 1.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the final value of `ans` is printed.

### Issues in the Program
The logic of the program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The key issue is in the way `g` is calculated and used to update `ans`. The program does not correctly check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for each pair (a, b).

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if `a + b` is divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`. Here is a correct approach:

1. Iterate over all `b` from 1 to `m`.
2. For each `b`, iterate over all `a` from 1 to `n`.
3. Check if `a + b` is divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`.
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

This approach is computationally expensive for large `n` and `m` but is necessary to ensure correctness.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
