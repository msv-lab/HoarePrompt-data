The code snippet `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000. 

After executing the code, `n` will hold the length of `s`. The other conditions and properties of `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`.**
