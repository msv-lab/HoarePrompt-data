`t` is assigned the value `int(input(''))`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` is now a specific integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The other variables (`n`, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` where each `a_i` is either 0 or 1. There is at least one `a_i` equal to 1 in each test case.**
