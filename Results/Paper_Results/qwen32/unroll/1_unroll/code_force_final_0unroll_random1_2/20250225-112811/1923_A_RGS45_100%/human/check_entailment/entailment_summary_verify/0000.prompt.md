You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string of `n` characters (each being either '0' or '1' with at least one '1' present). For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of '0's between the first and last '1' in the string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a ribbon divided into `n` cells, each either free (0) or containing a chip (1).
- We can move chips to the closest free cell to the left.
- The goal is to move the chips into a single contiguous block with the minimum number of moves.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the ribbon configuration as a string of 0s and 1s.

2. **Finding the Range of Chips**:
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first chip (1) from the left.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the first chip (1) from the right. However, this is not directly useful as it is the index from the reversed string, not the original string. It needs to be adjusted to get the correct index from the original string, which should be `n - 1 - y`.

3. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` is intended to capture the substring from the first chip to the last chip. However, due to the incorrect calculation of `y`, this substring is incorrect.
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of free cells (0s) in the substring `z`.

### Issues:
- The calculation of `y` is incorrect. It should be `n - 1 - y` to correctly identify the last chip's position.
- The substring `z` is not correctly capturing the range of cells between the first and last chip.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
5
0 1 0 0 1
```
- The first chip is at index 1.
- The last chip is at index 4.
- The correct substring to consider is `arr[1:5]` which is `1001`.
- The number of free cells (0s) in this substring is 2.

However, the program calculates `y` incorrectly and ends up considering an incorrect substring, leading to an incorrect count of free cells.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not handle the problem correctly due to the incorrect calculation of the last chip's position and the resulting incorrect substring.

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation:
The program fails to correctly identify the range of cells between the first and last chip due to an incorrect calculation of the last chip's position. This results in an incorrect count of the free cells within that range, leading to incorrect output for at least some test cases.
