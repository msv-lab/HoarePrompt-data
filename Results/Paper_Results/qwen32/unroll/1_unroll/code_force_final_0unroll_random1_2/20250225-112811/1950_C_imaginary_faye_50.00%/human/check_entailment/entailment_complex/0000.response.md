Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each of the `t` test cases, it reads a string `s` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".

2. **Extracting Hours and Minutes:**
   - The program extracts the hour part `h` from the string `s` using `s[:2]`.

3. **Converting Hours:**
   - If `h` is "00", it prints "12" (midnight in 12-hour format).
   - If `h` is between "01" and "12" (inclusive), it prints the hour as is.
   - If `h` is greater than "12", it prints `int(h) - 12` formatted to two digits (e.g., "13" becomes "01").

4. **Appending AM/PM:**
   - The program appends "AM" if the original hour `h` is less than "12", otherwise it appends "PM".

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the converted time in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM".

### Issues in the Program:
- **Leading Zeroes in Converted Hours:**
  - The program does not ensure that the converted hour has a leading zero when it is a single digit (e.g., "01" instead of "1").
  - Specifically, the line `print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')` should be `print('{:02}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')` to ensure two digits.
  
- **Midnight and Noon Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles "00" as "12 AM" and "12" as "12 PM".

### Example Issue:
For the input "13:05", the program will output "1 PM" instead of "01 PM" because it doesn't format the hour to two digits.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program is not fully correct as it does not handle leading zeroes in the converted hour correctly.

**Correctness: False**
