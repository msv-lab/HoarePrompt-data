Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the field such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd; `grid` is an empty list; `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' mapped to the tuple (-1, -1); `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary; `goal` is a list containing two empty lists.**

In simple terms, the dimensions `n` and `m` remain unchanged as odd integers between 3 and 99. The `grid` list, `elements` dictionary, and `allPlayers` dictionary also remain unchanged. The new variable `goal` is introduced as a list containing two empty lists.
