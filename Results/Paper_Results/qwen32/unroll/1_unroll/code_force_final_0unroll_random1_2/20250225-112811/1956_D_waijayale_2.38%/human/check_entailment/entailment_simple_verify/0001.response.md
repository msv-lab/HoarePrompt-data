### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array `a` by performing a series of operations where each operation can change a subarray to its MEX (minimum excluded value). The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. We need to output the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations that achieve this sum.

#### Analysis of the Program

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - **Purpose**: This function is supposed to handle the case where `l == r` (a single element subarray) and also to fill a subarray with its MEX.
    - **Implementation**:
        - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not 0. If it is not, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and records the operation.
        - If `l != r`, it recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`, then checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If it is not, it sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
    - **Annotations**:
        - The annotations correctly describe the behavior of `func_1`. However, the logic of setting `a[l]` to 0 when `a[l] != 0` and setting the subarray to `r - l + 1` when `a[l] != r - l + 1` is questionable. This does not align with the goal of maximizing the sum using the MEX operation.
    - **Issues**:
        - The function does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray. It simply sets the subarray to `r - l + 1`, which is not necessarily the MEX.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - **Purpose**: This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum`.
    - **Implementation**:
        - It initializes `ops` as an empty list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.
        - It returns the sum of the array `a`, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
    - **Annotations**:
        - The annotations correctly describe the behavior of `func_2`. However, there is a critical issue: `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined within the scope of `func_2`, which would cause a `NameError`.
    - **Issues**:
        - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined, leading to a runtime error.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
    - **Purpose**: This function attempts to maximize the sum of the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.
    - **Implementation**:
        - It calculates the sum `s` of the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.
        - If `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it calls `func_1` and sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1`.
        - If `s` is greater than this value, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of this maximum element.
    - **Annotations**:
        - The annotations correctly describe the behavior of `recursive_maximize_sum`. However, the logic here is flawed. It does not correctly compute the MEX and apply it to maximize the sum.
    - **Issues**:
        - The function does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray. It simply sets the subarray to `r - l + 1` when `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, which is not necessarily the MEX.
        - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined, leading to a runtime error.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
    - **Purpose**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and operations, and then prints the results.
    - **Implementation**:
        - It reads the input values, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and operations, and then prints the results.
    - **Annotations**:
        - The annotations correctly describe the behavior of `func_3`.
    - **Issues**:
        - The issues with `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum` would cause this function to not work correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided code has several issues:
- `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined within the scope of `func_2`, leading to a runtime error.
- The logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` is not correctly implemented to achieve the goal of maximizing the sum using the MEX operation.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
