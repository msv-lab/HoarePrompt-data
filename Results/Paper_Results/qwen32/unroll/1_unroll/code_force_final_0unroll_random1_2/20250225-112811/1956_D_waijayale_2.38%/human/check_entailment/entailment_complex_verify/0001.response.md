### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided Python program based on the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version of the code.

#### Problem Recap:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array `a` by performing operations that change a subarray to its MEX (minimum excluded value). The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. We need to output the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations that achieve this sum.

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - The function is supposed to handle the case where `l == r` and also to fill a subarray with its MEX.
    - The recursive call `func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)` is incorrect because it doesn't correctly compute the MEX for the subarray.
    - The logic to set `a[l] = 0` if `a[l] != 0` is not aligned with the goal of maximizing the sum.
    - The function is supposed to set the subarray to the MEX value, but it does not compute the MEX correctly.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum`.
    - However, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined within the scope of `func_2`, which would cause a `NameError` at runtime.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
    - This function is intended to maximize the sum of the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.
    - The logic checks if the current sum `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If so, it calls `func_1` and then sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1`. This logic is flawed because it does not compute the MEX correctly.
    - If the sum is already greater than this value, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of this maximum element. This part of the logic is also flawed because it doesn't correctly compute the MEX and apply it to maximize the sum.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
    - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and operations, and then prints the results.
    - Due to the issues with `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum`, this function will not work correctly.

#### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- The annotations describe the state of the program before and after key operations, but they do not reflect the correct logic for computing the MEX and maximizing the sum.
- The annotations show that the program does not correctly compute the MEX and apply it to the subarrays.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code has several issues:
- `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined within the scope of `func_2`, leading to a runtime error.
- The logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` is not correctly implemented to achieve the goal of maximizing the sum using the MEX operation.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Final: **False**
