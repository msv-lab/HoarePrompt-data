To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, m)` statement, we need to understand the values of `s` and `m` based on the provided initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by the function `func_2(a)`.

### Analysis:
The values of `s` and `m` are determined by the function `func_2(a)`. Since the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `s` and `m`. However, we can describe what `s` and `m` represent based on the context.

Given that `func_2` returns three values and these values are used in the `print` statement, we can infer that `s` and `m` are likely some computed results or properties derived from the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
Without the exact implementation of `func_2`, we can't provide specific values for `s` and `m`. However, we can describe them in terms of what they represent based on the context.

Output: **s, m (where s and m are values returned by the function `func_2(a)`)**
