Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by repeatedly performing an operation that sets a subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of that subarray. The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set.

### Code Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, l, r, ops)`
- This function seems to be intended to handle the base case when `l == r` and to recursively process the subarray from `l+1` to `r`.
- It checks if the single element at `l` is not zero and sets it to zero if it's not, appending the operation to `ops`.
- Then, it recursively calls itself to process the subarray from `l+1` to `r`.
- After the recursion, it checks if the element at `l` is not equal to `r - l + 1` (which is the MEX of the subarray from `l` to `r` if all elements from `0` to `r-l` are present). If not, it sets the entire subarray from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.

#### Function 2: `func_2(a)`
- This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` with the full range of the array.
- It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

#### Function 3: `recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`
- This function is supposed to maximize the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
- It first calculates the sum of the subarray and checks if it is less than or equal to the square of the length of the subarray. If it is, it calls `func_1` and then sets the entire subarray to `r - l + 1`.
- If the sum is greater, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of this maximum element.

#### Function 4: `func_3()`
- This is the main function that reads input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.

### Issues in the Code

1. **Undefined `ops` in `recursive_maximize_sum`**: The `ops` list is defined in `func_2` but not passed to `recursive_maximize_sum`, leading to a `NameError`.
2. **Incorrect Logic in `recursive_maximize_sum`**: The condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is not a reliable way to determine if the subarray should be set to `r - l + 1`. The MEX operation should be based on the actual elements present in the subarray, not on the sum.
3. **Incorrect Handling of MEX**: The MEX should be calculated as the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, but the code incorrectly assumes it to be `r - l + 1` in some cases.
4. **Inefficient Operations**: The code does not guarantee that the operations are performed optimally to maximize the sum.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to maximize the sum of the array based on the MEX operation. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
