You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a).
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if (s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)) :
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
            
        #State: `l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a); `s` is the sum of `a[l:r + 1]`. The current value of `s` is (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1). The list `ops` now includes the tuple `(l, r)`. All elements in the list `a` from index `l` to index `r` (inclusive) are now set to the value (r - l + 1).
    else :
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if (pos != l) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        #State: `l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a); `s` is the sum of `a[l:r + 1]` and is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1); `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`; `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, then the current value of `pos` is not equal to `l`. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos`.
        if (pos != r) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
        #State: `l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a); `s` is the sum of `a[l:r + 1]` and is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1); `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`; `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called. If `pos` is equal to `r`, no further changes are made to `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos`.
    #State: `l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a); `s` is the sum of `a[l:r + 1]`. If `s` is less than or equal to (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), `s` is updated to (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1) and all elements in the list `a` from index `l` to index `r` (inclusive) are set to the value (r - l + 1), and the tuple `(l, r)` is added to the list `ops`. If `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, and `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called. If `pos` is equal to `r`, no further changes are made to `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` accepts two integer parameters `l` and `r` such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a). It returns the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within the slice of the array `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
