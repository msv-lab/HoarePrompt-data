### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the provided annotations and the problem description. We'll focus on the correctness of the logic and variable scoping.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Issue 1**: The function `func_1` is called recursively without passing the `ops` list and the array `a`. This will lead to a `NameError` because `ops` and `a` are not defined within the scope of `func_1`.
- **Issue 2**: If `l == r`, the function incorrectly sets `a[l]` to 0 instead of the MEX of the subarray `{a[l]}`. The MEX of a single element `{x}` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `{x}`, which is `0` if `x != 0` and `1` if `x == 0`. This is not handled correctly.
- **Issue 3**: The recursive call to `func_1` and subsequent operations do not correctly compute the MEX and set the elements of the array.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Issue 1**: The function `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum` without passing the list `a` or the list `ops` as arguments. This will result in a `NameError` because `a` and `ops` are not defined within the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

#### Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:
- **Issue 1**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is supposed to recursively split the array and compute the MEX for subarrays, but it does not correctly handle the MEX calculation or the operations.
- **Issue 2**: The MEX is not computed correctly. The condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is not the correct condition for setting the subarray to the MEX. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
- **Issue 3**: The operations are not recorded correctly, and the array is not modified as intended.

#### Function `func_3`:
- **Issue 1**: The function `func_3` correctly reads the input and calls `func_2` to get the sum, number of operations, and the operations themselves. However, since `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum` are incorrect, the output will not be correct.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases. There are multiple issues with variable scoping, incorrect logic for computing the MEX, and incorrect handling of operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
