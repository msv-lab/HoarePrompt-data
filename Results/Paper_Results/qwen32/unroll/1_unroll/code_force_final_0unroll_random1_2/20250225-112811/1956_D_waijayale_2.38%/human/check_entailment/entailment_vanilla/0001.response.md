Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array `a` by performing a series of operations where each operation can change a subarray to its MEX (minimum excluded value). The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. We need to output the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations that achieve this sum.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - This function seems to be designed to handle the case where `l == r` (i.e., a single element subarray) and also to fill a subarray with its MEX.
    - It calls itself recursively, which is not ideal for this problem as it doesn't seem to handle the MEX calculation in a meaningful way.
    - The logic to set `a[l] = 0` if `a[l] != 0` is unclear and doesn't align with the goal of maximizing the sum.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum`.
    - However, `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined within the scope of `func_2`, which would cause a `NameError`.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
    - This function attempts to maximize the sum of the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.
    - It checks if the current sum `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If so, it calls `func_1` and then sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1`.
    - If the sum is already greater than this value, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of this maximum element.
    - The logic here is somewhat flawed as it doesn't correctly compute the MEX and apply it to maximize the sum.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
    - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and operations, and then prints the results.
    - The issue with `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum` would cause this function to not work correctly.

### Conclusion
The provided code has several issues:
- `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined within the scope of `func_2`, leading to a runtime error.
- The logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` is not correctly implemented to achieve the goal of maximizing the sum using the MEX operation.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
