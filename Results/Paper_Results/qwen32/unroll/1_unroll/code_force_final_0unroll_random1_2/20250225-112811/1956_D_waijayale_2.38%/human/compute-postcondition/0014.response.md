Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a); `s` is the sum of `a[l:r + 1]` and is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1); `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`; `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called. If `pos` is equal to `r`, no further changes are made to `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos`.**
