### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the code and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate or if there are any issues that need to be addressed.

#### Key Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Scope and Variable Passing:**
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the list `a` or the list `ops` as arguments. This will indeed result in a `NameError` because `a` and `ops` are not defined within the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.
   - The function `func_1` does not receive `a` and `ops` as arguments, leading to undefined behavior when trying to modify these lists.

2. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly sets `a[l]` to 0 when `l == r` instead of setting it to the MEX of the subarray.
   - The recursive call to `func_1` and subsequent operations do not correctly compute the MEX and set the elements of the array.

3. **Logic in `recursive_maximize_sum`:**
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray.
   - The condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is not the correct condition to determine when to set the subarray to the MEX.
   - The operations are not recorded correctly, and the array is not modified as intended.

4. **Output Handling:**
   - The function `func_3` correctly reads the input and calls `func_2` to get the sum, number of operations, and the operations themselves. However, since `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum` are incorrect, the output will not be correct.

### Analysis of the Code:
Let's review the code step-by-step to identify and correct the issues:

#### Function `func_1`:
- `func_1` is supposed to recursively set the elements of the array to the MEX of the subarray and record the operations.
- If `l == r`, it should set `a[l]` to the MEX of the subarray, not 0.
- The recursive call and subsequent operations need to correctly compute the MEX and set the elements of the array.

#### Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:
- This function should correctly compute the MEX of the subarray.
- The condition to set the subarray to the MEX should be based on the MEX calculation, not the sum condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
- The operations should be recorded correctly.

### Corrected Code:
Here is a corrected version of the code addressing the issues:

```python
def compute_mex(subarray):
    mex = 0
    while mex in subarray:
        mex += 1
    return mex

def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        mex = compute_mex([a[l]])
        if mex != a[l]:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = mex
        return
    func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
    mex = compute_mex(a[l:r + 1])
    if mex != a[l]:
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = mex
        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)

def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []
    func_1(a, 0, n - 1, ops)
    return sum(a), len(ops), ops

def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)

# Example usage:
# func_3()
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying several critical issues in the code, including scope and variable passing, incorrect logic for computing the MEX, and incorrect conditions for setting the subarray to the MEX. The corrected code addresses these issues and should now correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect, but the assessment is accurate in identifying the issues.)
