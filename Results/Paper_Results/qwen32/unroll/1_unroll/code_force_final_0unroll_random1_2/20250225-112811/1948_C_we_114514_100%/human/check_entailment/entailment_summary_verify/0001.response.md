### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining if a robot can move from the top-left corner `(1, 1)` of a `2xN` grid to the bottom-right corner `(2, N)`. The robot can move left, right, up, or down, but must follow the direction of the arrow in the cell it lands on. Additionally, no arrow points outside the grid, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

#### Solution Analysis:
The solution involves a function `func_1` that checks whether the robot can reach the target cell based on the given grid configuration. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The function calculates `half_n` which is `n // 2`. This is used to iterate over the grid.
2. **Loop through the grid**: The loop iterates through the first half of the columns up to `half_n - 1`. It checks if there is a pattern where the arrow in the first row points left (`<`) and the corresponding arrows in the second row either point left at the current column or two columns ahead. If such a pattern is found, it returns 'No'.
3. **Final column check**: After the loop, it checks if the last column in the first row points left and the second last column in the second row points left. If both conditions are true, it returns 'No'.
4. **Default return**: If none of the conditions for returning 'No' are met, it returns 'Yes'.

#### Evaluation:
Let's consider the provided example cases:

1. **First example**:
   - `n = 4`
   - `row1 = ">><<"`
   - `row2 = ">>><"`
   - The function checks the pattern and finds no condition that leads to 'No'. It returns 'Yes'. This is correct as the robot can follow the path `(1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4)`.

2. **Second example**:
   - `n = 2`
   - `row1 = "><"`
   - `row2 = "><"`
   - The function checks the pattern and finds no condition that leads to 'No'. It returns 'Yes'. This is correct as the robot can follow the path `(1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2)`.

3. **Third example**:
   - `n = 4`
   - `row1 = ">>><"`
   - `row2 = "><<<"`
   - The function checks the pattern and finds a condition that leads to 'No'. It returns 'No'. This is correct as the robot cannot reach `(2, 4)` due to the left-pointing arrows in the second row.

4. **Fourth example**:
   - `n = 6`
   - `row1 = "><><>"`
   - `row2 = "><>>><"`
   - The function checks the pattern and finds no condition that leads to 'No'. It returns 'Yes'. This is correct as the robot can follow the path `(1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6)`.

### Verification:
The function `func_1` seems to correctly identify patterns that would prevent the robot from reaching the target cell. However, let's verify if the logic is comprehensive by considering another test case:

- **Additional Test Case**:
  - `n = 6`
  - `row1 = "><><><"`
  - `row2 = "><><><"`
  - The function checks the pattern and finds no condition that leads to 'No'. It returns 'Yes'. This is correct as the robot can follow the path `(1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (1, 4) -> (1, 5) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6)`.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution appears to correctly handle the given examples and additional test cases. The logic checks for patterns that would prevent the robot from reaching the target cell and returns the appropriate result.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the correctness of the given program is:

Final: **True**
