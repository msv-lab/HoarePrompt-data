Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
We need to determine if a robot can move from the top-left corner of a 2xN grid to the bottom-right corner. The robot can move left, right, up, or down, but it must follow the direction of the arrow in the cell it lands on. Additionally, no arrow points outside the grid, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

### Solution Analysis
The solution involves a function `func_1` that checks whether the robot can reach the target cell based on the given grid configuration. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The function calculates `half_n` which is `n // 2`. This is used to iterate over the grid.
2. **Loop through the grid**: The loop iterates through the first half of the columns up to `half_n - 1`. It checks if there is a pattern where the arrow in the first row points left (`<`) and the corresponding arrows in the second row either point left at the current column or two columns ahead. If such a pattern is found, it returns 'No'.
3. **Final column check**: After the loop, it checks if the last column in the first row points left and the second last column in the second row points left. If both conditions are true, it returns 'No'.
4. **Default return**: If none of the conditions for returning 'No' are met, it returns 'Yes'.

### Evaluation
Let's consider the provided example cases:

1. **First example**:
   - `n = 4`
   - `row1 = ">><<"`
   - `row2 = ">>><"`
   - The function checks the pattern and finds no condition that leads to 'No'. It returns 'Yes'.

2. **Second example**:
   - `n = 2`
   - `row1 = "><"`
   - `row2 = "><"`
   - The function checks the pattern and finds no condition that leads to 'No'. It returns 'Yes'.

3. **Third example**:
   - `n = 4`
   - `row1 = ">>><"`
   - `row2 = "><<<"`
   - The function checks the pattern and finds a condition that leads to 'No'. It returns 'No'.

4. **Fourth example**:
   - `n = 6`
   - `row1 = "><><>"`
   - `row2 = "><>>><"`
   - The function checks the pattern and finds no condition that leads to 'No'. It returns 'Yes'.

### Conclusion
The provided solution appears to correctly handle the given examples and the problem constraints. The logic checks for patterns that would prevent the robot from reaching the target cell and returns the appropriate result.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
