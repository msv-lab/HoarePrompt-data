Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for determining if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid of arrows. Let's analyze the logic and find a case where it fails.

#### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - The function checks if there are any configurations of arrows that would prevent the robot from reaching (2, n).
    - The logic primarily checks for specific patterns in the arrows, specifically focusing on the second row and the last arrow in the first row.
    - It assumes that if there are certain configurations of arrows (e.g., `<` in the first row and `<` in the second row at specific positions), the robot cannot reach the destination. However, this logic is not comprehensive and does not account for all possible paths the robot can take.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - This function reads the input and applies `func_1` to each test case.
    - It collects the results and prints them.

#### Potential Issue:
The logic in `func_1` is too restrictive and does not correctly simulate all possible paths the robot can take. Let's consider an example where the robot can reach (2, n) but the function incorrectly returns "No".

#### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
6
>>><<<
><>>><
```

Expected Output: `YES`
- The robot can move as follows:
  - Start at (1, 1)
  - Move right to (1, 2)
  - Follow the arrow to (1, 3)
  - Move right to (1, 4)
  - Follow the arrow to (2, 4)
  - Move right to (2, 5)
  - Follow the arrow to (2, 6)

However, `func_1` will incorrectly return "No" for this input because it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement and checks for specific patterns that do not cover all possible paths.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases and can return incorrect results for some inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
