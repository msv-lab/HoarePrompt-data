### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided functions to determine if they meet the requirements.

#### Problem Summary:
- The robot starts at (1,1).
- It must reach (2,n).
- Each second, the robot moves one cell in any direction (left, right, up, down) and then follows the arrow in the current cell.
- Arrows can only point left or right and cannot point outside the grid.
- The grid has two rows and `n` columns.

#### Provided Functions:
1. **`func_1(n, row1, row2)`**:
   - This function determines if the robot can move from (1,1) to (2,n) given the configurations of `row1` and `row2`.
   - It checks specific conditions involving '<' and '>' in `row1` and `row2` to determine the result.
   - The output hints suggest that `func_1` returns 'No' if certain configurations are detected, otherwise 'Yes'.

2. **`func_2()`**:
   - This function reads the input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results.
   - It handles multiple test cases, reads the grid configurations, and uses `func_1` to determine if the robot can reach the target for each test case.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function checks if there are any configurations in `row1` and `row2` that would prevent the robot from reaching (2,n).
- The specific checks in `func_1` are:
  - For each pair of columns `(2*i, 2*i+1)`, it checks if `row1[2*i+1]` is '<' and either `row2[2*i]` or `row2[2*i+2]` is '<'. If so, it returns 'No'.
  - It also checks if `row1[n-1]` is '<' and `row2[n-2]` is '<'. If so, it returns 'No'.
  - If none of these conditions are met, it returns 'Yes'.

#### Verification:
- The checks in `func_1` seem to address the critical configurations that would prevent the robot from reaching (2,n).
- The function correctly handles the constraints and the logic aligns with the problem description.

#### Conclusion:
- Given the problem description and the provided execution summaries, `func_1` appears to correctly determine if the robot can reach (2,n) based on the grid configurations.
- `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to produce the desired output for each test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
