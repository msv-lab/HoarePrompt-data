### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct. We need to verify whether the logic in `func_1` correctly identifies whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) given the constraints and the movement rules.

#### Problem Recap:
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It moves left, right, up, or down, then follows the arrow in the new cell.
- The goal is to reach (2, n).

#### Key Points in `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: `half_n = n // 2` is calculated.
2. **Loop through the grid**:
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `half_n - 2`.
   - For each `i`, it checks if `row1[2 * i + 1] == '<'` and either `row2[2 * i] == '<'` or `row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'`.
   - If both conditions are true, it returns 'No'.
3. **Final column check**:
   - It checks if `row1[n - 1] == '<'` and `row2[n - 2] == '<'`.
   - If both conditions are true, it returns 'No'.
4. **Default return**: If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'Yes'.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Loop through the grid**:
  - The loop checks for a specific pattern where the robot could get stuck or unable to move forward. Specifically, it checks if there is a left arrow in the first row at an odd index and a left arrow in the second row either at the same index or two columns ahead.
  - This pattern could potentially trap the robot in the first row, preventing it from moving to the second row.
- **Final column check**:
  - This check ensures that the robot can move from the last column of the first row to the second last column of the second row and then to the last column of the second row.
  - If both arrows point left, the robot cannot move forward from the last column of the first row to the second row.

### Evaluation Against Example Cases:
1. **First example**:
   - `n = 4`
   - `row1 = ">><<"`
   - `row2 = ">>><"`
   - The function checks the pattern and finds no condition that leads to 'No'. It returns 'Yes'.
   - **Correct**: The robot can move as follows: (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4).

2. **Second example**:
   - `n = 2`
   - `row1 = "><"`
   - `row2 = "><"`
   - The function checks the pattern and finds no condition that leads to 'No'. It returns 'Yes'.
   - **Correct**: The robot can move as follows: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2).

3. **Third example**:
   - `n = 4`
   - `row1 = ">>><"`
   - `row2 = "><<<"`
   - The function checks the pattern and finds a condition that leads to 'No'. It returns 'No'.
   - **Correct**: The robot cannot move from (1, 4) to (2, 4) due to the left arrows.

4. **Fourth example**:
   - `n = 6`
   - `row1 = "><><>"`
   - `row2 = "><>>><"`
   - The function checks the pattern and finds no condition that leads to 'No'. It returns 'Yes'.
   - **Correct**: The robot can move as follows: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6).

### Conclusion:
The logic in `func_1` appears to correctly identify patterns that would prevent the robot from reaching the target cell (2, n). The function checks for conditions where the robot could get trapped or unable to move forward, and it correctly handles the provided example cases.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the correctness of the given program is:

Final: **True**
