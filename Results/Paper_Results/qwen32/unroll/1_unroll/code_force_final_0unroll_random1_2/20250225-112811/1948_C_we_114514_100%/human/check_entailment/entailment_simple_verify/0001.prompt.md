You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
We need to determine if a robot can move from the top-left corner of a 2xN grid to the bottom-right corner. The robot can move left, right, up, or down, but it must follow the direction of the arrow in the cell it lands on. Additionally, no arrow points outside the grid, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

### Solution Analysis
The solution involves a function `func_1` that checks whether the robot can reach the target cell based on the given grid configuration. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The function calculates `half_n` which is `n // 2`. This is used to iterate over the grid.
2. **Loop through the grid**: The loop iterates through the first half of the columns up to `half_n - 1`. It checks if there is a pattern where the arrow in the first row points left (`<`) and the corresponding arrows in the second row either point left at the current column or two columns ahead. If such a pattern is found, it returns 'No'.
3. **Final column check**: After the loop, it checks if the last column in the first row points left and the second last column in the second row points left. If both conditions are true, it returns 'No'.
4. **Default return**: If none of the conditions for returning 'No' are met, it returns 'Yes'.

### Evaluation
Let's consider the provided example cases:

1. **First example**:
   - `n = 4`
   - `row1 = ">><<"`
   - `row2 = ">>><"`
   - The function checks the pattern and finds no condition that leads to 'No'. It returns 'Yes'.

2. **Second example**:
   - `n = 2`
   - `row1 = "><"`
   - `row2 = "><"`
   - The function checks the pattern and finds no condition that leads to 'No'. It returns 'Yes'.

3. **Third example**:
   - `n = 4`
   - `row1 = ">>><"`
   - `row2 = "><<<"`
   - The function checks the pattern and finds a condition that leads to 'No'. It returns 'No'.

4. **Fourth example**:
   - `n = 6`
   - `row1 = "><><>"`
   - `row2 = "><>>><"`
   - The function checks the pattern and finds no condition that leads to 'No'. It returns 'Yes'.

### Conclusion
The provided solution appears to correctly handle the given examples and the problem constraints. The logic checks for patterns that would prevent the robot from reaching the target cell and returns the appropriate result.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
