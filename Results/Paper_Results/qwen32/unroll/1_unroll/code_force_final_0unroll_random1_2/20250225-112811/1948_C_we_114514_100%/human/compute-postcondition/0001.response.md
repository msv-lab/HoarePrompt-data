The value of `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `row1` and `row2` are strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', `t` is an input integer.**
