Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of list `a` and string `s`), `m` (an integer used as the modulus), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'). The function returns a list where each element is the cumulative product modulo `m` of the elements of `a` in reverse order, but the resulting list is itself in reverse order.**
