You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function takes an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It rearranges the elements of `a` based on the instructions in `s`, computes the cumulative product modulo `m` of the rearranged list in reverse order, and returns the resulting list in reverse order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program appends elements to the list `b` based on the commands but does not compute the product of the current state of the array `a` and take the remainder when divided by `m` as required. Instead, it computes the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, which is incorrect.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation**:
   - The program appends elements to `b` based on the commands ('L' or 'R').
   - It then computes the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and takes the remainder when divided by `m`.
   - This does not match the requirement of computing the product of the current state of `a` (which changes after each command) and taking the remainder when divided by `m`.

2. **Expected vs Actual Behavior**:
   - **Expected**: For each command, compute the product of all elements in the current state of `a` and take the remainder when divided by `m`. Then, remove the leftmost or rightmost element based on the command.
   - **Actual**: The program computes the product of elements in `b` (which is not the current state of `a`) and takes the remainder when divided by `m`.

### Example to Illustrate the Issue

Let's consider the first test case from the problem statement:

**Input:**
```
4
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 2 4 1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Initial array: `[3, 1, 4, 2]`
- Command 'L': Product = 3 * 1 * 4 * 2 = 24, Remainder = 24 % 6 = 0. Remove leftmost element: `[1, 4, 2]`
- Command 'R': Product = 1 * 4 * 2 = 8, Remainder = 8 % 6 = 2. Remove rightmost element: `[1, 4]`
- Command 'R': Product = 1 * 4 = 4, Remainder = 4 % 6 = 4. Remove rightmost element: `[1]`
- Command 'L': Product = 1, Remainder = 1 % 6 = 1. Remove leftmost element: `[]`

**Actual Output from Provided Program:**
- The program will not produce the expected output because it does not correctly compute the product of the current state of `a`.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem description. It computes the product of elements in `b` (which is not the current state of `a`) and takes the remainder when divided by `m`, instead of computing the product of the current state of `a` and taking the remainder when divided by `m` for each command.
