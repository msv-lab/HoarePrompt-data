The provided code snippet only defines a type variable `T` using `TypeVar('T')`. This does not affect any of the existing variables `t`, `n`, `v`, or `p`. Since no operations are performed on these variables, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000. `v` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `v_i` satisfies 1 <= v_i <= 10^9. `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. The sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `T` is a type variable.**
