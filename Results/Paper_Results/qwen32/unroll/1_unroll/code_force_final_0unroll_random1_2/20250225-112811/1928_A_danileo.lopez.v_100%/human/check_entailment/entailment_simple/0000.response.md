### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\). For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\) representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Logic for Cutting and Rearranging**:
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles:
     - If \(a\) is even, he can cut it into two rectangles of size \(a/2 \times b\).
     - If \(b\) is even, he can cut it into two rectangles of size \(a \times b/2\).
   - For each case, after cutting, it checks if the new rectangle formed by rearranging the two smaller rectangles is different from the original rectangle:
     - If the new rectangle's dimensions are not the same as the original (ignoring rotation), it prints "Yes".
     - Otherwise, it prints "No".
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it is impossible to form a different rectangle by cutting, so it prints "No".

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - The program uses `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0` to check if at least one dimension is even.
   - It then checks if the resulting rectangle after cutting is different from the original rectangle by comparing dimensions.
   - If neither dimension is even, it directly prints "No".

### Evaluation Against Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: \(1 \times 1\)
  - Both dimensions are odd, so the output should be "No".
  - The program correctly outputs "No".

- **Test Case 2**: \(2 \times 1\)
  - \(a\) is even, but cutting results in \(1 \times 1\) and \(1 \times 1\), which can only form a \(1 \times 2\) rectangle (same as \(2 \times 1\)).
  - The program correctly outputs "No".

- **Test Case 3**: \(2 \times 6\)
  - \(a\) is even, cutting results in \(1 \times 6\) and \(1 \times 6\), which can form a \(2 \times 6\) rectangle.
  - However, rearranging \(1 \times 6\) and \(1 \times 6\) can form a \(2 \times 3\) rectangle, which is different.
  - The program correctly outputs "Yes".

- **Test Case 4**: \(3 \times 2\)
  - \(b\) is even, cutting results in \(3 \times 1\) and \(3 \times 1\), which can form a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle (different from \(3 \times 2\)).
  - The program correctly outputs "Yes".

- **Test Case 5**: \(2 \times 2\)
  - \(a\) and \(b\) are even, cutting results in \(1 \times 2\) and \(1 \times 2\), which can form a \(1 \times 4\) rectangle (different from \(2 \times 2\)).
  - The program correctly outputs "Yes".

- **Test Case 6**: \(2 \times 4\)
  - \(a\) and \(b\) are even, cutting results in \(1 \times 4\) and \(1 \times 4\), which can form a \(1 \times 8\) rectangle (different from \(2 \times 4\)).
  - The program correctly outputs "Yes".

- **Test Case 7**: \(6 \times 3\)
  - \(a\) is even, cutting results in \(3 \times 3\) and \(3 \times 3\), which can only form a \(3 \times 6\) rectangle (same as \(6 \times 3\)).
  - The program correctly outputs "No".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original rectangle based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
