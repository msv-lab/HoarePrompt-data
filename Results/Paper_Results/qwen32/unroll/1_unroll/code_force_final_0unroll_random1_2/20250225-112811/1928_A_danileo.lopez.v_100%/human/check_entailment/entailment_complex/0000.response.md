### Reasoning:
The program's logic is based on the observation that for Bob to form a different rectangle from the two resulting rectangles obtained by cutting the original rectangle, at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle must be even. This is because only then can the rectangle be split into two equal parts along that dimension, and these parts can be reassembled into a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases, `t`, and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Dimension Check**:
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, the program checks if the resulting halves can form a new rectangle different from the original one:
     - If `a` is even, it checks if `a // 2` is not equal to `b`. If not, it prints "Yes".
     - If `b` is even, it checks if `b // 2` is not equal to `a`. If not, it prints "Yes".
   - If neither `a` nor `b` is even, it prints "No" because the rectangle cannot be split into two equal parts.
3. **Output**: Based on the checks, the program outputs "Yes" or "No" for each test case.

The program correctly handles the cases where the rectangle can be split into two equal parts and reassembled into a different rectangle. It also correctly handles the cases where the rectangle cannot be split in such a way.

### Correctness:
The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and it correctly determines whether Bob can form a different rectangle. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
