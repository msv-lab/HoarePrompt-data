You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The problem states that Bob can only form a new rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange these two smaller rectangles into a new one with different dimensions (ignoring rotations).

2. The program checks if either dimension of the rectangle is even. If either dimension is even, it means that it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.

3. If `a` is even, the program divides `a` by 2 to get two smaller rectangles of dimensions `a // 2` by `b`. If `a // 2` is not equal to `b`, it prints "Yes" because a new rectangle can be formed.

4. Similarly, if `b` is even, the program divides `b` by 2 to get two smaller rectangles of dimensions `a` by `b // 2`. If `b // 2` is not equal to `a`, it prints "Yes" because a new rectangle can be formed.

5. If neither dimension is even, the program prints "No" because it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides that can be rearranged into a new rectangle with different dimensions.

6. However, the program does not correctly handle the case where both dimensions are even. For example, for a 4x4 rectangle, the program would incorrectly print "No" because it checks each dimension separately and finds that neither 4 // 2 (which is 2) is different from the other dimension (4). But, a 4x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x4 rectangles and then rearranged into an 8x2 rectangle, which is a different rectangle.

7. Therefore, the program is not correct for all cases.
