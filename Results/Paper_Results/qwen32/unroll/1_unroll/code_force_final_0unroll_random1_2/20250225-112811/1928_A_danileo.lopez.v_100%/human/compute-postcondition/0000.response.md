Output State: **The function takes no arguments but operates on multiple test cases provided via standard input. Each test case consists of two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the dimensions of Bob's rectangle. The number of test cases, t, is assigned the value of the integer input.**
The number of test cases `t` is now known, but the values of `a` and `b` for each test case are still to be read.
