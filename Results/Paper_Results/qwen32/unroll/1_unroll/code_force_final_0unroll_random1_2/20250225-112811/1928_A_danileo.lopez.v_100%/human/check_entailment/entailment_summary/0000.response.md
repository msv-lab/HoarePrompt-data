### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The logic in the program is based on the observation that if either dimension of the rectangle is even, it can be cut into two equal parts along that dimension. If the resulting smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a different rectangle, the program outputs "Yes". Otherwise, it outputs "No".

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Even Dimension Check**: For each rectangle, it checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.
3. **Splitting and Comparison**:
   - If \(a\) is even, it considers splitting the rectangle into two rectangles of size \(a/2 \times b\).
   - If \(b\) is even, it considers splitting the rectangle into two rectangles of size \(a \times b/2\).
   - It then checks if the resulting smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a different rectangle:
     - If \(a/2 \neq b\), then the resulting rectangles can form a different rectangle, and the program outputs "Yes".
     - If \(b \neq a\), then the resulting rectangles can form a different rectangle, and the program outputs "Yes".
   - If neither condition is met, it outputs "No".
4. **Odd Dimension Case**: If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the program directly outputs "No" because it's not possible to split the rectangle into two equal parts along either dimension.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic for determining if a new rectangle can be formed from the given rectangle by checking the evenness of the dimensions and ensuring that the resulting smaller rectangles can form a different rectangle. The program handles all given examples correctly, and the logic aligns with the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.
