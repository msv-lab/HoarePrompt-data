You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i is either 0 or 1. There is at least one 1 in each test case's list a.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: t lines, each line containing the count of '0's in the substring of arr between the first and last '1's for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of cells and the configuration of chips and free cells. It then finds the first occurrence of a chip (`x`) and the first occurrence of a chip from the end (`y`). It slices the array from the first chip to the last chip (`z`) and counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in this slice.

However, this approach does not correctly account for the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together. The correct approach involves calculating the cost of moving each chip to the median position of the chips. Here's why the provided program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program only counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip. This does not account for the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together. For example, in the case `0 1 0 0 0 1`, the program would output `3` (the number of `0`s between the first and last `1`), but the correct answer is `1` (move the rightmost `1` to the left).

2. **Median Position**: The optimal strategy to minimize the number of moves is to move all chips to the median position of the chips. The median minimizes the total distance that all chips need to travel.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = list(map(int, input('').split()))
        positions = [i for i in range(n) if arr[i] == 1]
        median = positions[len(positions) // 2]
        moves = sum(abs(p - median) for p in positions)
        print(moves)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program calculates the positions of all chips, finds the median position, and then calculates the total number of moves required to bring all chips to this median position. This ensures that the solution is correct for all possible inputs.
