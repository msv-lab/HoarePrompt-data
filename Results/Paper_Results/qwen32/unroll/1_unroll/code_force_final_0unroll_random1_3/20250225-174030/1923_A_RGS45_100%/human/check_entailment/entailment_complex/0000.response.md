### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of operations needed to move chips such that they form a single contiguous block without any free cells (0s) between them. The key observation here is that the minimum number of moves required is equivalent to the number of 0s between the first and last 1s in the sequence.

Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cells) and the sequence of cells `arr`, which is then stripped of any whitespace.

2. **Finding the First and Last '1's:**
   - `x = arr.find('1')`: This finds the index of the first '1' in the sequence.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: This finds the index of the last '1' in the sequence by reversing the array and finding the first '1' in the reversed sequence. The actual index of the last '1' in the original sequence is `n - y - 1`.

3. **Counting the 0s Between the First and Last '1's:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]`: This creates a substring from the first '1' to the last '1'. The slice is taken from `x` to `n - y` because `y` is the index of the last '1' in the reversed sequence, so `n - y - 1` is the actual index in the original sequence. However, since we are slicing up to but not including the end index, `n - y` is used.
   - `print(z.count('0'))`: This counts the number of '0's in the substring `z`, which corresponds to the minimum number of moves required to consolidate the chips into a single block.

### Verification with Examples:

- **First Example:**
  - Input: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
  - First '1' at index 1, last '1' at index 6.
  - Substring: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
  - Number of '0's: 1
  - Output: `1`

- **Second Example:**
  - Input: `0 1 0 0 0 0`
  - First '1' at index 1, last '1' at index 1.
  - Substring: `1`
  - Number of '0's: 0
  - Output: `0`

- **Third Example:**
  - Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - First '1' at index 0, last '1' at index 5.
  - Substring: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Number of '0's: 0
  - Output: `0`

- **Fourth Example:**
  - Input: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - First '1' at index 0, last '1' at index 4.
  - Substring: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - Number of '0's: 2
  - Output: `2`

- **Fifth Example:**
  - Input: `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
  - First '1' at index 1, last '1' at index 7.
  - Substring: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
  - Number of '0's: 3
  - Output: `3`

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required in each case, as demonstrated by the examples.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and implements the solution as intended.
