To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `tc > 0` is satisfied. The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one.

Given the state right before the loop: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `tc` is an input integer; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.

To make the loop execute at least once, `tc` must be greater than 0. Right before the loop, `tc` is an input integer, so it must be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `tc` must be greater than 0; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.**
