Functionality: **The function `func_2` takes an integer `n`, three integers `na`, `nb`, and `nc` representing the sizes of three groups, and a list `numbers` of `n` positive integers. It sorts the list in descending order and attempts to split it into three groups of sizes `na`, `nb`, and `nc`. If the sums of these groups satisfy a condition defined by `func_1`, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
