### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the function summary in detail to determine if the code meets the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Input:**
   - An integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - Two integers `n` and `m`.
     - An array `a` of `n` integers.
     - A string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'.

2. **Processing:**
   - For each command in `s`:
     - Compute the remainder of the product of all elements in the current array `a` modulo `m`.
     - If the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from `a`.
     - If the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from `a`.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output `n` integers representing the remainders after each command.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The code consists of a main loop that processes each test case and a function `func_1` that performs the required operations.

#### Function `func_1` Breakdown:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `b = []`: An empty list to store the elements of `a` in the order they are removed.
   - `l = 0` and `r = n - 1`: Pointers to the leftmost and rightmost elements of `a`.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - For each command in `s`:
     - If the command is 'L', append `a[l]` to `b` and increment `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', append `a[r]` to `b` and decrement `r`.

3. **Calculating Remainders:**
   - `ans = []`: An empty list to store the remainders.
   - `p = 1`: Initialize the product.
   - For each element `v` in `reversed(b)`, update `p = p * v % m` and append `p` to `ans`.

4. **Return Statement:**
   - `return reversed(ans)`: Return the remainders in the correct order.

#### Issues in the Code:
- **Incorrect Order of Product Calculation:**
  - The function calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order, but the problem requires the product to be calculated in the order the elements were removed from `a`.
  
- **Incorrect Product Calculation:**
  - The function calculates the product of all elements in `b` (which are the elements removed from `a`), but it should calculate the product of the remaining elements in `a` after each removal.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the initial product of all elements in `a` modulo `m`.
2. Iterate over the commands in `s` and update the product by removing the appropriate element (either from the left or the right) and taking the new product modulo `m`.

#### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    # Calculate the initial product of all elements in a modulo m
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    
    ans = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    
    for command in s:
        ans.append(product)
        if command == 'L':
            # Remove the leftmost element and update the product
            product = (product * pow(a[l], m - 2, m)) % m  # Use modular inverse
            l += 1
        else:
            # Remove the rightmost element and update the product
            product = (product * pow(a[r], m - 2, m)) % m  # Use modular inverse
            r -= 1
    
    return ans
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the required product at each step.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
