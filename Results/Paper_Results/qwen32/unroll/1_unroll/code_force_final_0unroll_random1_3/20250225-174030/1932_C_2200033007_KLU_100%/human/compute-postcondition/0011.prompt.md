You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^4, a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: `b` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= b_i <= 10^4, arranged according to the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in the string `s`; `l` is the number of 'L' characters encountered in `s`; `r` is `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters encountered in `s`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: `b` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the string `s`, `r` is `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop in reverse order of `b`, `p` is the final value after all iterations.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of list `a` and string `s`. `m` is a positive integer. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^4. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The function returns the list `ans` in reverse order.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `ans` in reverse order.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
