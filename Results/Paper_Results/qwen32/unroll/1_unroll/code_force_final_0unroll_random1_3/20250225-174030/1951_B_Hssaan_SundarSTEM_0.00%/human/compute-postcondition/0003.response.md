Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it performs specific swaps and calculations to determine the longest non-increasing subsequence starting from the first element after the swaps. It outputs the maximum value between two calculated results for each test case.**
