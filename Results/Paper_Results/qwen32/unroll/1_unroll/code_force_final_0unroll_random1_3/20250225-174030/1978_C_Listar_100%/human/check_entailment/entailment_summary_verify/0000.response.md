### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the code and its behavior based on the provided problem description, function summaries, and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \).
- The Manhattan value is calculated as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |p_i - i| \).
- If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".
- If a permutation exists, we should output "Yes" and the permutation.

#### Function Summaries and Analysis:
1. **`func_4`**:
   - Reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - Checks if \( k \) is odd. If so, returns `0, 0` (indicating no valid permutation).
   - Calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`):
     - If \( n \) is odd: \( \text{max\_k} = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \)
     - If \( n \) is even: \( \text{max\_k} = \frac{n^2}{2} \)
   - If `max_k` is less than \( k \), it returns `0, 0`.
   - Otherwise, it returns \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **`func_1`**:
   - Starts with the identity permutation `l = [1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - Iterates over the permutation in reverse order with a step of -2.
   - Adjusts the permutation using `func_2` and `func_3` to match the required \( k \).

3. **`func_2` and `func_3`**:
   - `func_2`: Swaps elements to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - `func_3`: Swaps elements to adjust the Manhattan value.

4. **`func_5`**:
   - Prints "YES" and the permutation if a valid permutation is found.

5. **`func_6`**:
   - Handles multiple test cases by calling `func_4` and `func_1`.

#### Testing and Validation:
- The original assessment tested the code with several examples, including edge cases, and found that the code produced the expected results.
- The function summaries and the code logic seem to align with the problem requirements.

#### Verification:
- **Odd \( k \) Check**: The code correctly returns "No" if \( k \) is odd, as the Manhattan value is always even.
- **Maximum \( k \) Check**: The code correctly calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value and returns "No" if \( k \) exceeds this value.
- **Permutation Generation**: The code uses a systematic approach to generate permutations by iteratively adjusting the permutation and checking the Manhattan value.

Given the analysis and the tests performed, the code appears to correctly handle all specified cases and edge conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
