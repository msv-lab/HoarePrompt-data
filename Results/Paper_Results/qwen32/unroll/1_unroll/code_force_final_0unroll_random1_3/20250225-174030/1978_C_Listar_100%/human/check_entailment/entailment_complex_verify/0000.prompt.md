You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

    8 14
    
    112 777
    
    5 12
    
    5 2

Output

    Yes
    3 1 2
    No
    Yes
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    No
    Yes
    8 2 3 4 5 6 1 7
    No
    Yes
    5 4 3 1 2
    Yes
    2 1 3 4 5
    
Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze whether it meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \). The Manhattan value is defined as:
\[ \text{Manhattan value} = |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \]

The program consists of multiple functions:
- `func_1`: Main function to generate the permutation.
- `func_2`: Helper function to swap elements in the permutation.
- `func_3`: Another helper function to swap elements in the permutation.
- `func_4`: Function to read input and check if a valid permutation exists.
- `func_5`: Function to print the permutation.
- `func_6`: Main function to handle multiple test cases.

### Code Analysis

1. **Input Handling (`func_4`)**:
   - The function reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It checks if \( k \) is odd. If so, it returns `0, 0` (indicating no valid permutation).
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`):
     - If \( n \) is odd: \( \text{max\_k} = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \)
     - If \( n \) is even: \( \text{max\_k} = \frac{n^2}{2} \)
   - If `max_k` is less than \( k \), it returns `0, 0`.
   - Otherwise, it returns \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Permutation Generation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function starts with the identity permutation `l = [1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates over the permutation in reverse order with a step of -2.
   - It calculates the Manhattan value incrementally and adjusts the permutation using `func_2` and `func_3` to match the required \( k \).

3. **Element Swapping (`func_2` and `func_3`)**:
   - `func_2`: Swaps elements to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - `func_3`: Swaps elements to adjust the Manhattan value.

4. **Output (`func_5`)**:
   - Prints "YES" and the permutation if a valid permutation is found.

5. **Main Function (`func_6`)**:
   - Handles multiple test cases by calling `func_4` and `func_1`.
