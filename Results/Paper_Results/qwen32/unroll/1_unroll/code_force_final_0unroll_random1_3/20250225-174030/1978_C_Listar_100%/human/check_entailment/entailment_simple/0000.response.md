### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step based on the problem description and the annotated execution states.

1. **Function `func_4()`**:
   - This function handles input parsing and checks if a valid permutation with the given `k` is possible.
   - It checks if `k` is even because the Manhattan value of a permutation is always even. If `k` is odd, it returns `0, 0` indicating no valid permutation.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a permutation of length `n`. For even `n`, `max_k` is `n^2 / 2`, and for odd `n`, it is `(n^2 - 1) / 2`.
   - If `k` is greater than `max_k`, it returns `0, 0` indicating no valid permutation.
   - Otherwise, it returns the valid `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - This function constructs a permutation with the given Manhattan value `k`.
   - It first divides `k` by 2 because the Manhattan value calculations are adjusted for even values.
   - It initializes a list `l` as a permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates from `n` down to `1` in steps of `2`, adjusting `k` and the list `l` to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - If `k` becomes `0`, it returns the current list `l`.
   - If `k` is less than `i - 1`, it calls `func_2()` to make a specific swap in the list `l` to achieve the remaining Manhattan value.
   - It calls `func_3()` to swap the `c`-th element from the start with the `c`-th element from the end, effectively making a swap that contributes to the Manhattan value.

3. **Function `func_2(c, k, l)`**:
   - This function makes a specific swap in the list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value by `k`.
   - It swaps the elements at indices `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l`.

4. **Function `func_3(c, l)`**:
   - This function swaps the `c`-th element from the start with the `c`-th element from the end in the list `l`.

5. **Function `func_5(l)`**:
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation `l`.

6. **Function `func_6()`**:
   - This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4()` to get valid `n` and `k`, then `func_1()` to get the permutation, and finally `func_5()` to print the result.

### Verification:

- **Even `k` Check**: The program correctly checks if `k` is even, which is necessary for the Manhattan value to be achievable.
- **Max `k` Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value correctly based on the parity of `n`.
- **Permutation Construction**: The program uses a systematic approach to construct a permutation that achieves the desired Manhattan value by making strategic swaps.
- **Output**: The program correctly prints "YES" followed by the permutation or "NO" if no valid permutation exists.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the problem requirements and constraints, and it is verified through the annotated states and the logic described.

**Correctness: True**
