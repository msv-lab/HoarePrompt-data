### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that it correctly handles the problem requirements for all possible valid inputs. Let's break down the program and its components:

1. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value of a permutation is always even.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. If `k` exceeds this maximum, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for constructing a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.
   - It starts with the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It attempts to increase the Manhattan value by swapping elements in the list.
   - It uses `func_2` and `func_3` to perform specific swaps based on the value of `k`.
   - The process is iterative and involves decrementing `k` until it reaches 0 or a specific condition is met.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function swaps two elements in the list `l` at specific positions based on the values of `c` and `k`.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function swaps the `c`-th element from the start and the `c`-th element from the end of the list `l`.

5. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation if a valid permutation is found.

6. **Function `func_6`**:
   - This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0 (indicating an invalid case from `func_4`), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and `func_5` to print it.

### Key Points:
- The Manhattan value is always even, so if `k` is odd, the program correctly returns "NO".
- The maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is `(n^2 - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd and `n^2 // 2` if `n` is even. If `k` exceeds this, the program correctly returns "NO".
- The construction of the permutation in `func_1` involves a series of swaps to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
- The swapping logic in `func_2` and `func_3` is designed to incrementally increase the Manhattan value by swapping elements in specific ways.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all edge cases and construct valid permutations when possible. It correctly identifies invalid cases (where `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value) and constructs permutations with the correct Manhattan value when valid.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
