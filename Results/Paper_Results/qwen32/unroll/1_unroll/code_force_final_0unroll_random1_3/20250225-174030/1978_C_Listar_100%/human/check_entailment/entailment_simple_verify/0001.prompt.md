You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find a permutation of length `n` such that the Manhattan value of the permutation equals `k`. The Manhattan value is defined as the sum of absolute differences between each element in the permutation and its position.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of several functions, each performing specific tasks:

1. **func_4()**: This function reads the input values `n` and `k` for a test case. It checks if `k` is even (since the Manhattan value is always even) and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. If `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation exists. Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **func_1(n, k)**: This function attempts to construct a permutation with a Manhattan value of `k`. The approach involves iteratively adjusting the permutation by swapping elements to increase the Manhattan value. It starts with the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` and iteratively performs swaps to increase the Manhattan value until it reaches `k`. The function `func_1` calls `func_2` and `func_3` to perform the necessary swaps.

3. **func_2(c, k, l)**: This function performs a specific swap in the list `l` to increase the Manhattan value by `k`. It swaps the element at position `-c` with the element at position `-c - k`.

4. **func_3(c, l)**: This function performs another specific swap in the list `l` to increase the Manhattan value. It swaps the element at position `-c` with the element at position `c - 1`.

5. **func_5(l)**: This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation `l` if a valid permutation is found.

6. **func_6()**: This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to get the input values `n` and `k`, then calling `func_1` to attempt to construct a valid permutation. If `func_1` returns a valid permutation, it prints "YES" and the permutation. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Handling Odd `k`**: The program correctly checks if `k` is odd and returns "NO" if it is, as the Manhattan value is always even.

2. **Maximum Manhattan Value**: The program calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value correctly. For an even `n`, the maximum value is `n^2 / 2`, and for an odd `n`, it is `(n^2 - 1) / 2`. This is because the maximum deviation for each element is `n-1`, and the sum of deviations for all elements is maximized when each element is placed at the farthest possible position.

3. **Constructing Permutation**: The program attempts to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value using a series of swaps. The logic for swapping elements to increase the Manhattan value seems correct, but verifying the exact correctness of the swapping logic would require a detailed combinatorial proof, which is beyond the scope of this analysis.

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints "YES" followed by the permutation if a valid permutation is found, and "NO" otherwise.

### Conclusion

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to correctly handle the edge cases and construct a valid permutation when possible. The logic for checking the feasibility of `k` and the approach for constructing the permutation seem sound.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
