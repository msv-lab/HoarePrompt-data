### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its components to determine if they collectively solve the problem as described.

1. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It checks if `k` is even. If not, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no valid permutation can be formed.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` based on whether `n` is odd or even.
   - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`, indicating valid inputs for further processing.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function generates a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.
   - It starts with a list `l` of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It iterates backward through the list, making swaps to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - The process involves either swapping specific elements (using `func_2` and `func_3`) or directly modifying the list to achieve the target value `k`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function swaps two elements in the list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - It swaps the elements at indices `-c` and `-c-k`.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function swaps the `c`-th element from the start with the `c`-th element from the end of the list `l`.

5. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation if a valid permutation is found.
   - It prints the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.

6. **Function `func_6`**:
   - This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to validate `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0 (indicating invalid `k`), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then `func_5` to print the result.

### Analysis:

- **Validation and Input Handling (`func_4`)**:
  - The function correctly checks if `k` is even and if it exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value. This ensures that only valid inputs are processed further.

- **Generating the Permutation (`func_1`)**:
  - The algorithm starts with the identity permutation and makes strategic swaps to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
  - The logic involves iterating backward through the list and making swaps based on the remaining value `k`.
  - The use of `func_2` and `func_3` to perform specific swaps suggests a systematic approach to modifying the permutation.

- **Output (`func_5`)**:
  - The function correctly prints "YES" followed by the permutation if a valid one is found.

- **Orchestration (`func_6`)**:
  - This function ties everything together, ensuring that the input is validated and the permutation is generated and printed correctly.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to generate a permutation with the specified Manhattan value or determine that no such permutation exists. The functions work together to handle input validation, permutation generation, and output formatting as required by the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
