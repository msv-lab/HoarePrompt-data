Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, and for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 <= |`s`| <= 500.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the input, while the condition on `t` (1 <= `t` <= 500) remains valid. The description of `s` for each test case remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code snippet.
