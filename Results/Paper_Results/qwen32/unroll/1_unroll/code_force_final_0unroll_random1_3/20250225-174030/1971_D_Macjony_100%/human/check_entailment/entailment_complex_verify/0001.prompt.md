You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 <= |s| <= 500.

    #State: A series of integers, each representing the adjusted count of transitions for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes a string `s` consisting of '0's and '1's. It then calculates and prints the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string, subtracting one if there is at least one '01' transition.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it to the requirements of the problem.

The task is to find the minimum number of pieces a binary string needs to be cut into so that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string. A sorted binary string is one where all '0's come before all '1's.

The program's logic is as follows:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the binary string.
- It initializes `count` to 1 (since at least one piece is needed).
- It uses a `flag` to check if there is a transition from '0' to '1' in the string.
- It iterates through the string, checking if the current character is different from the next character. If they are different, it increments the `count` by 1.
- If a transition from '0' to '1' is found, it sets the `flag` to `True`.
- After the loop, if the `flag` is `True`, it decrements the `count` by 1 and prints the result.

Now, let's analyze the logic:
- The `count` variable is incremented every time there is a transition between '0' and '1' in the string. This is correct because each transition indicates a new piece is needed.
- However, the `flag` and the decrement of `count` based on the `flag` are unnecessary. The presence of a '01' transition does not mean that we should decrement the count. Instead, the count should simply reflect the number of transitions plus one.
- The program works correctly for the given examples, but the unnecessary `flag` and decrement do not affect the correctness in these specific cases. However, they could lead to incorrect results in other scenarios.

Let's consider a counterexample:
If the input is `101010`, the program will count 5 transitions ('10', '01', '10', '01') and set the `flag` to `True`. It will then decrement the count to 4, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 5 pieces.

The program's logic should simply count the number of transitions and add one, without using the `flag` and decrement. However, the provided program does not fail for the given examples, and the logic seems to work by coincidence.

Correctness: **False**  
The program's logic is overly complicated and includes unnecessary steps that could lead to incorrect results in other scenarios. A simpler and more direct approach would be to count the number of transitions and add one. However, since the program does not fail for the provided examples, it might be considered correct for those specific cases, but it is not universally correct.
