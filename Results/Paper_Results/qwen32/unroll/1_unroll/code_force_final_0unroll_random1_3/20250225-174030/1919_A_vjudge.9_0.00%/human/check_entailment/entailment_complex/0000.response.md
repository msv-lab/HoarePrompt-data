### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the number of coins Alice and Bob have in their wallets. The game involves taking turns, swapping wallets, and removing coins until one player cannot make a move. The problem states that both players play optimally.

The key insight here is that the game can be analyzed based on the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets. If the sum of the coins is even, Bob wins. If the sum is odd, Alice wins. This is because the game essentially reduces to a Nim game with a single pile of coins where the total number of coins determines the winner when both players play optimally.

Let's break down the provided functions:

1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function takes the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`a` and `b`), calculates the sum, and checks if the sum is even or odd. If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob', otherwise it returns 'Alice'. This logic aligns with the insight that the sum's parity determines the winner.

2. **func_2()**: This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases (`t`), then for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, calls `func_1` to determine the winner, and stores the result. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The provided functions correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the sum's parity, and they handle multiple test cases as required by the problem description.
