You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic used in `func_1` and see if it correctly determines the winner of the game based on the given problem description.

Let's break down the problem and the solution step by step:

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Dynamics**: 
   - Alice and Bob take turns.
   - Each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not.
   - After choosing, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob wins.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice wins.

### Explanation of the Program:
- **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
  - This function determines the winner based on the sum of coins in both wallets.
  - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns 'Bob'.
  - Otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.

- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - It reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
  - It calls `func_1` to determine the winner and appends the result.
  - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Verification of the Logic:
- The key insight here is that the game is essentially determined by the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins `(a + b)`.
  - If the total number of coins is even, the first player (Alice) can always be forced into a losing position if both play optimally.
  - If the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force the second player (Bob) into a losing position.

### Conclusion:
The logic implemented in `func_1` is correct based on the problem analysis. The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
