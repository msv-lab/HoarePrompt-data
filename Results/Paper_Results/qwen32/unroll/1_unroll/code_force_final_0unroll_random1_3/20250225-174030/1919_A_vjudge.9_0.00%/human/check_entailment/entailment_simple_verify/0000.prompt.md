You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns with their wallets. Each player can either swap wallets or not, and then they must remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses. The goal is to determine who will win if both play optimally.

### Key Insight:
The optimal strategy involves considering the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins (a + b). If the total number of coins is even, Bob will win. If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will win. This is because:
- If the total number of coins is even, Alice will always leave Bob with an odd number of coins after her turn, and Bob can always leave Alice with an even number of coins after his turn. Eventually, Bob will be left with the last coin and Alice will lose.
- If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always leave Bob with an even number of coins after her turn, and Bob will always leave Alice with an odd number of coins after his turn. Eventually, Alice will be left with the last coin and Bob will lose.

### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Determines the winner based on the parity of `a + b`.
2. `func_2()`: Handles input and output for multiple test cases.

Let's verify if the code correctly implements the above logic:

#### Function `func_1(a, b)`:
- It checks if the sum `a + b` is even or odd.
- If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
- If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

This matches the optimal strategy derived from the problem analysis.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
- It calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner and stores the result.
- Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

This function correctly handles multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the winner for each case.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the total number of coins and handles multiple test cases as required by the problem description.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins in both Alice's and Bob's wallets. It handles multiple test cases and outputs the correct winner for each case.
