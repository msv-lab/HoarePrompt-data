To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_1` correctly determines the winner of the game based on the given rules.

The game revolves around the total number of coins and whether it is even or odd. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initial Observation**: If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice will win. If it is even, Bob will win. This is because:
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always ensure that Bob ends up with an even number of coins after each of her turns. This means that Bob will eventually be left with a single coin and Alice will be left with zero coins, making Bob the one who cannot make a move.
   - Conversely, if the total number of coins is even, Bob can always ensure that Alice ends up with an odd number of coins after each of his turns, leading to Alice being the one who cannot make a move.

2. **Implementation Check**: The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic by checking if the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even or odd and returning 'Bob' or 'Alice' accordingly.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function handles input and output correctly by reading the number of test cases, processing each test case using `func_1`, and printing the results.

Given the above analysis, the logic in the provided program is correct. Therefore, the response is:

Correctness: **True**
