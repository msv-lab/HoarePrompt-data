The function `func_1` determines the winner of a game based on the shortest path from a starting node to two different leaf nodes in an undirected tree. It accepts three parameters: `n`, the number of nodes; `edges`, a list of edges connecting the nodes; and `start`, the starting node. The function returns 'Ron' if at least one of the shortest paths from the starting node to any two leaf nodes has an odd length, otherwise it returns 'Hermione'.
