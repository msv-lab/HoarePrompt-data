The code snippet initializes a set named `visited` with the starting node `start`. This means that the starting node is now marked as visited. The other variables (`start`, `target`, `tree`, and `queue`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node in the tree, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, both within the range of 1 to n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree; `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree; `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`; `visited` is a set containing the `start` node.**
