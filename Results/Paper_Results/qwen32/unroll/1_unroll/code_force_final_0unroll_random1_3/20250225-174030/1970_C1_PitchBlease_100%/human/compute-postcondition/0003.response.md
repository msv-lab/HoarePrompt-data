The code snippet creates a list called `leaves` that contains all nodes in the tree that have only one connection (i.e., nodes with a degree of 1). The initial state of the variables `n`, `edges`, `start`, and `tree` remains unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `leaves`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge between nodes u and v with 1 <= u, v <= n, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed such that 1 <= start <= n, `tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and the corresponding value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to the key node by an edge, `leaves` is a list of nodes in `tree` that have exactly one connection.**
