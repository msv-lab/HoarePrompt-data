You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        
        print(year)
        
    #State: For each test case, the variable `year` will hold the cumulative sum calculated by the inner loop, where for each integer `ai` in the list `a`, `year` is incremented by `year % ai` if `year % ai` is not zero, otherwise it is incremented by `ai`. The final value of `year` for each test case is printed. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` will not retain their values after the loop completes the iteration for that test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and verify its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The Chaya tribe believes in `n` signs of the apocalypse, where the `i-th` sign occurs every `a_i` years.
- Signs must occur sequentially, meaning that after the `i-th` sign occurs in year `x`, the tribe waits for the `(i+1)-th` sign starting from year `x+1`.
- The goal is to find the year in which the `n-th` sign occurs, which triggers the apocalypse.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_i`. It then calculates the year in which the `n-th` sign occurs using the logic:
```python
year += year % ai or ai
```
This line essentially ensures that `year` is updated to the next multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current `year`.

### Verification:
Let's break down the logic:
- `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`.
- If `year % ai` is not zero, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, and `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `year % ai`. Adding this to `year` will not give the next multiple of `ai`, so we need to add `ai - (year % ai)` to `year` to get the next multiple.
- If `year % ai` is zero, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, and `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `ai`. Adding `ai` to `year` will give the next multiple of `ai`.

However, the correct logic should be:
```python
year += (ai - year % ai) % ai
```
This ensures that `year` is always updated to the next multiple of `ai` correctly.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the provided program with the given examples and some edge cases.

#### Example 1:
Input:
```
4
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 1 1 1 1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```
Output:
```
36
5
5
2012
```
The program produces the correct output for these examples.

#### Edge Case 1:
Input:
```
1
1
1
```
Output:
```
1
```
The program should output `1` because the first sign occurs in the first year.

#### Edge Case 2:
Input:
```
1
2
2
```
Output:
```
2
```
The program should output `2` because the first sign occurs in the first year and the second sign occurs in the second year.

#### Edge Case 3:
Input:
```
1
3
3
```
Output:
```
3
```
The program should output `3` because the first sign occurs in the first year, the second sign occurs in the third year, and the third sign occurs in the sixth year, but we are only interested in the year the second sign occurs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for finding the next multiple of `ai`. The line `year += year % ai or ai` is incorrect and should be replaced with `year += (ai - year % ai) % ai` to ensure the correct year is calculated.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the logic for finding the next multiple of `ai`. The line `year += year % ai or ai` is incorrect and should be replaced with `year += (ai - year % ai) % ai` to ensure the correct year is calculated.
