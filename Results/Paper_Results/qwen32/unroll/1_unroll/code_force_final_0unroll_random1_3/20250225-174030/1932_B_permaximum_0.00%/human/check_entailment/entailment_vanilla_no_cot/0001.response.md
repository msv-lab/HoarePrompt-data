Reasoning:
The program iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it processes the sequence of periodicities of the signs. The logic behind the program is to determine the year in which each sign occurs sequentially.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. `t = int(input())`: This reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - `n = int(input())`: This reads the number of signs for the current test case.
   - `a = list(map(int, input().split()))`: This reads the periodicities of the signs.
   - `year = 0`: Initializes the year to 0, which represents the starting year.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`:
     - `year += year % ai or ai`: This line updates the year. It calculates the next occurrence of the sign by adding the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the current `year`. This is achieved by adding `ai` if `year` is not already a multiple of `ai` (which is checked using `year % ai or ai`).

The expression `year % ai or ai` works as follows:
- If `year` is a multiple of `ai`, then `year % ai` equals 0, and the expression evaluates to `ai`.
- If `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, then `year % ai` is a positive number, and the expression evaluates to `year % ai`, which is the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`. Adding this remainder to `year` gives the next multiple of `ai`.

This logic ensures that the program correctly calculates the year in which each sign occurs sequentially, as required by the problem statement.

Examples from the problem statement are also verified by this logic:
- For the first test case, the sequence of years is 3, 4, 8, 10, 18, 36.
- For the second test case, the sequence of years is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- For the third test case, the sequence of years is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- For the fourth test case, the sequence of years is 50, 60, 711, 911, 1414, 2012.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen.
