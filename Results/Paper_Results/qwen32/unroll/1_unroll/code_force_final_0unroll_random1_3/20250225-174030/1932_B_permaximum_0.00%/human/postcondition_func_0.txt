The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers. For each test case, it calculates a cumulative sum based on the elements of the list and prints the result. Specifically, for each integer in the list, if the current cumulative sum modulo the integer is non-zero, the cumulative sum is incremented by that modulo value; otherwise, it is incremented by the integer itself.
