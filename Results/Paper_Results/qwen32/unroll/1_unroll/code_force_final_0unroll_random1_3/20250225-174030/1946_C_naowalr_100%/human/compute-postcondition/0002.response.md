Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not take any parameters. It reads multiple sets of input data from standard input, where each set consists of two integers `n` and `k` representing the number of vertices and the number of edges to be removed, respectively, followed by `n-1` lines of edges between vertices. The function processes each set to determine the maximum number `x` such that removing exactly `k` edges results in all remaining connected components having at least `x` vertices.**
