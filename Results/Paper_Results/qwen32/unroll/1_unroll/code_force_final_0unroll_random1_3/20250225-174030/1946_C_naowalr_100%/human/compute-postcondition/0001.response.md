Output State: **The function `func_1` has processed all sets of input data provided through standard input. For each set, it has determined the maximum number `x` such that removing exactly `k` edges results in all remaining connected components having at least `x` vertices. The state of variables not involved in the loop (such as those used within the `solve()` function) remains unchanged from their state after processing the last input set.**
