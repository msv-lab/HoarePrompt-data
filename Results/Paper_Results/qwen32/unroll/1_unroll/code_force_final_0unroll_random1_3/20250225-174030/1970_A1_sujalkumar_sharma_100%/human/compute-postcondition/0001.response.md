The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `prefix_balance`. This action does not affect the values of `s` or `n`, which remain as a non-empty string of balanced parentheses and the length of `s`, respectively.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is an empty list.**
