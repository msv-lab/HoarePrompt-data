To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the operations within the loop. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer, and `n` is not equal to 2.
   - `max_index` is 0.
   - `min_indices` is [0].

2. **Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - For each iteration, the function `func_1` is called with parameters `max_index`, `min_indices[0]`, `max_index`, and `i`.
   - The result of `func_1` is compared:
     - If the result is `'<'`, `min_indices` is updated to `[i]`.
     - If the result is `'='`, `i` is appended to `min_indices`.

Given the initial state, `max_index` is 0, and `min_indices` is `[0]`. The loop starts with `i = 0`, and since `min_indices[0]` is also 0, the first iteration will not change `min_indices` because `func_1(0, 0, 0, 0)` will not result in a value that causes `min_indices` to be updated.

For subsequent iterations, the behavior depends on the output of `func_1`. However, without the specific implementation of `func_1`, we can consider the general possibilities:

- If `func_1` consistently returns `'='` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `min_indices` will accumulate all values from 0 to `n-1`.
- If `func_1` returns `'<'` for any `i`, `min_indices` will be reset to `[i]` and will not accumulate further values unless `func_1` returns `'='` for subsequent values of `i`.

Since the problem does not provide the implementation of `func_1`, we cannot definitively predict the exact sequence of operations. However, based on the provided initial state and the nature of the loop, we can consider a likely scenario where `func_1` might return `'='` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

Thus, the output state, assuming `func_1` returns `'='` for all iterations, would be:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is 0, `min_indices` is [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1].**
