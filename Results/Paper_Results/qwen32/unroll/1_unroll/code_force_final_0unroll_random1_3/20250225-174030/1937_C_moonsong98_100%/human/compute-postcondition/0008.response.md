The code assigns the value of `max_index` to a new list called `min_indices`. The value of `max_index` remains unchanged, and `n` retains its initial state as an input integer that is not equal to 2.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is 0, `min_indices` is [0]**.
