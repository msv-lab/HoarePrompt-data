To understand the output state, let's break down the code and analyze what it does:

1. **Input Handling**: The code processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` (length of the list) and a list `array` of `l` integers.

2. **Alphabet List**: A list `alp` of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z' is defined.

3. **Reversing the Array**: The list `array` is reversed and stored in `rev_array`.

4. **Generating the Output String**:
   - An empty list `ans` is initialized to store the characters of the output string.
   - For each index `j` in the range of `l`:
     - The code counts how many times the element at `rev_array[j]` appears in the sublist `rev_array[j:]`.
     - It then subtracts 1 from this count and uses the result as an index to select a character from the `alp` list.
     - This character is appended to the `ans` list.
   - Finally, the characters in `ans` are joined into a single string and printed.

### Analysis of the Output:

For each element in the reversed array, the code determines how many times that element appears from that position to the end of the reversed array, subtracts 1, and uses this value as an index to pick a character from the alphabet list.

### Output State:

After all the test cases are processed, the output state will be a series of strings, one for each test case. Each string is generated based on the described process.

Output State: **For each test case, the output is a string where each character is determined by the count of elements in the reversed array from the current position to the end, minus one, used as an index in the alphabet list. The state of variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remains unchanged except for the values used in the current test case.**
