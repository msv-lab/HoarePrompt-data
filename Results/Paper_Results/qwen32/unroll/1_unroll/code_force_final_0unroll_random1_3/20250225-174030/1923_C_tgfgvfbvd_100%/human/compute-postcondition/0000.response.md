In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the function `int(input())`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1 since the loop will iterate `t` times.

The other variables (`n`, `q`, `c`, `l_i`, `r_i`) are defined and used within the loop body, so we do not need to adjust their states before the loop starts.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure that the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
