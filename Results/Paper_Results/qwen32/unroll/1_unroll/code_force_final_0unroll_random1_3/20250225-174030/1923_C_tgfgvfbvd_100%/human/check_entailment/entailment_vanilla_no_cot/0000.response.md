Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if a subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` of array `c` is "good". A subarray is considered "good" if there exists an integer array `b` of the same length such that:
1. The sum of elements in `b` equals the sum of elements in the subarray.
2. Each element in `b` is positive.
3. No element in `b` is equal to the corresponding element in the subarray.

### Key Observations

1. **Sum Condition**: The sum of the subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` must be able to be distributed into `b` such that all elements are positive and different from the elements in the subarray.
2. **Positive Elements**: Since all elements in `c` are positive, the smallest possible sum of a `b` array of the same length where all elements are positive is equal to the length of the subarray (i.e., `b_i > 0` for all `i`).
3. **Different Elements**: If the subarray has any element equal to 1, it is impossible to create a `b` array where all elements are positive and different from the corresponding elements in the subarray because the smallest positive integer is 1.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Prefix Sums and Count of 1s**:
   - `p`: Prefix sum array of `c`.
   - `c`: Prefix count array of 1s in `c`.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray using prefix sums and counts the number of 1s in the subarray.
   - It then checks if the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1s in the subarray. If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

### Issues in the Program

The main issue in the program is the logic for determining if a subarray is "good". The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is not sufficient to ensure that the subarray is "good". Specifically, it does not account for the fact that if a subarray contains a 1, it is impossible to create a `b` array where all elements are positive and different from the elements in the subarray.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly determine if a subarray is "good" based on the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion

**Correctness: False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it fails to account for the case where the subarray contains a 1, making it impossible to create a valid `b` array.
