The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are modified or assigned values in the provided code. The initial state of `t` and `test_cases` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, an integer m such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `results` is an empty list.**
