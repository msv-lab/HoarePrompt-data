#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, an integer m such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.

    #State: The `results` list will contain `t` elements, where each element is the number of additional characters needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the corresponding test case string `a`. The variables `t`, `test_cases`, and the structure of `results` remain as described in the initial state, but the `results` list will now be populated with the computed values.
    #
    #Output State:
    return results
    #The program returns the `results` list, which contains `t` elements. Each element in the `results` list is the number of additional characters needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the corresponding test case string `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n`, an integer `m`, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is the number of additional characters needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the corresponding test case string `a`.
