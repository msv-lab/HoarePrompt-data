### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case, such that each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G' is represented at least `m` times across `m` rounds.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the program’s logic and whether it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**: The function `func_1` initializes a list `results` to store the results of each test case.

2. **Iteration over Test Cases**: The function iterates over each test case, extracting the number of problems `n`, the number of rounds `m`, and the string of difficulties `a`.

3. **Frequency Calculation**: For each test case, it initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (representing the 7 difficulty levels 'A' to 'G'). It then counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `a` by incrementing the corresponding index in `freq`.

4. **Missing Calculation**: For each difficulty level, it calculates the number of additional problems needed by checking if the current frequency `f` is less than `m`. If it is, it adds the difference `m - f` to the total number of missing problems.

5. **Appending Results**: The total number of missing problems for the current test case is appended to the `results` list.

6. **Return Results**: After processing all test cases, the function returns the `results` list.

### Analysis of the Execution Summary:
The execution summary correctly describes the program’s behavior. It accurately states that the function calculates the number of additional characters needed to ensure each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the corresponding test case string `a`.

### Conclusion:
The program logic correctly implements the requirements of the problem. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed to meet the criteria of having at least `m` problems of each difficulty level.

**Correctness: True**
