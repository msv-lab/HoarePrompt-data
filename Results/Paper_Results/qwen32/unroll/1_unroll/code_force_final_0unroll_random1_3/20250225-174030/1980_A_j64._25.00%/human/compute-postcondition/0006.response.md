Functionality: **The function takes an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n`, an integer `m`, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is the number of additional characters needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the corresponding test case string `a`.**
