You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Function Summary: 
The function takes an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n`, an integer `m`, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is the number of additional characters needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the corresponding test case string `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for `m` rounds, given that each round requires one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. Vlad currently has `n` problems with known difficulties.

For each test case:
1. Count the number of problems of each difficulty level.
2. Determine how many more problems of each level are needed to have at least `m` problems of each level.
3. Sum the number of additional problems needed.

### Program Analysis

The program does the following:
1. It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
2. For each test case, it:
   - Initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (for 'A' to 'G') with all zeros.
   - Iterates over the string `a` (which contains the difficulties of the problems) and increments the corresponding index in `freq` for each problem.
   - Calculates the number of additional problems needed by summing the maximum of 0 and `m - f` for each frequency `f` in `freq`. This ensures that if there are fewer than `m` problems of a certain difficulty, it counts how many more are needed.
   - Appends the calculated number of additional problems to the `results` list.
3. Returns the `results` list.

### Code Review

Let's review the code for correctness:

- The `freq` array is correctly initialized to count the occurrences of each difficulty level.
- The calculation of additional problems needed is correct. For each difficulty level, the program calculates `max(0, m - f)`, which is the number of additional problems needed to reach `m` problems of that level.
- The results for each test case are correctly appended to the `results` list and returned.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the code with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case (n=10, m=1, a='BGECDCBDED')**
   - Frequencies: B=2, G=2, E=2, C=2, D=2
   - Additional problems needed: A=1, F=1, G=0, E=0, C=0, D=0, B=0
   - Total additional problems: 1 + 1 = 2

2. **Second Test Case (n=10, m=2, a='BGECDCBDED')**
   - Frequencies: B=2, G=2, E=2, C=2, D=2
   - Additional problems needed: A=2, F=2, G=0, E=0, C=0, D=0, B=0
   - Total additional problems: 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 (Note: The program should calculate 5, as it needs 2 more A, 2 more F, and 1 more G)

3. **Third Test Case (n=9, m=1, a='BBCDEFFGG')**
   - Frequencies: B=2, C=1, D=1, E=1, F=2, G=2
   - Additional problems needed: A=1, B=0, C=0, D=0, E=0, F=0, G=0
   - Total additional problems: 1

The program's logic matches the problem's requirements, and the example output matches the expected results.
