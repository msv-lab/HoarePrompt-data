### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description and the provided examples.

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field (`n` and `m`).
   - It reads the field grid and initializes the `elements` dictionary to map each entity (players, goals, Quaffle) to its position.
   - It also initializes the `allPlayers` dictionary to track which players are carrying the Quaffle.
   - The `goal` list is used to store the positions of the goals for each team.
   - The `points` list is initialized to keep track of the scores for each team.
   - It reads the number of steps (`t`) and then processes each command.

2. **Processing Commands**:
   - For each command, it checks if the command involves catching or throwing the Quaffle.
   - If the command is to catch the Quaffle, it updates the `allPlayers` dictionary to indicate that the player is carrying the Quaffle.
   - If the command is to throw the Quaffle, it updates the `allPlayers` dictionary to indicate that the player is no longer carrying the Quaffle.
   - If the player throws the Quaffle while at a goal, it updates the score for the appropriate team and prints the goal event.
   - For movement commands, it updates the position of the entity in the `elements` dictionary.

3. **Checking Goal Scores**:
   - The function `goalIn(pos)` correctly checks if a given position is a goal for either team and returns the appropriate team index.
   - The function `isPlayer(el)` correctly identifies whether a given entity is a player.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the score events as they occur and the final scores at the end of the game.

### Comparison with Examples:

- **First Example**:
  - The program correctly identifies the blue player scoring at the red goal and the red player scoring at the blue goal.
  - The final score is correctly printed as `FINAL SCORE: 1 1`.

- **Second Example**:
  - The program correctly identifies the blue player scoring at the red goal.
  - The final score is correctly printed as `FINAL SCORE: 0 1`.

- **Third Example**:
  - The program correctly identifies the red player scoring at their own goal, giving a point to the blue team.
  - The final score is correctly printed as `FINAL SCORE: 0 1`.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and passes all the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
