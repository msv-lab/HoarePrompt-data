Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input, representing the dimensions of the field; `grid` is an empty list; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the grid, where `elements = {'.B': (-1, -1)}`; `allPlayers` is a dictionary mapping player identifiers to a boolean indicating whether they are carrying the Quaffle, where `allPlayers = {}`; `goal` is a list of lists where `goal[0]` contains the positions of blue team goals and `goal[1]` contains the positions of red team goals, and `goal` is now `[[], []]`; `points` is `[0, 0]`; `t` is an integer representing the number of steps in the game; `command` is a list of strings representing a command where the first element is the entity performing the action, the second element is the action, and if the action is 'C', the third element is the ball being caught.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    grid.append(line)
    for ind in range(len(line)):
        if line[ind] != '..':
            elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
            if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
            elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
