Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the solution to the described problem.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Initialization and Variables:**
   - The dictionary `elements` is initialized with `'.B': (-1, -1)`, which is incorrect and not used in the rest of the code. This seems to be a leftover or incorrect initialization.
   - The dictionary `GoalName` is not defined anywhere in the provided code, but it is used in the print statements. This will cause a `NameError`.
   - The dictionary `mov` is not defined anywhere in the provided code, but it is used for movement calculations. This will cause a `NameError`.
   - The list `goal` is defined to hold the positions of goals, but it is not used correctly in the function `goalIn` because `goal` is not a global variable within that function.

2. **Logic Errors:**
   - The function `goalIn` is supposed to check if a position is a goal, but it doesn't have access to the `goal` list because it is not passed as an argument. This will cause incorrect results.
   - The movement logic is incorrect. The code does not check if the movement is valid (i.e., it does not ensure that the entity stays within the grid boundaries).
   - The catch and throw logic is not correctly implemented. For example, the code does not correctly handle the case where a player throws the Quaffle.
   - The scoring logic is not correctly implemented. For example, the code does not correctly handle the case where a player scores in the wrong goal.

3. **Output:**
   - The output format does not match the problem description. The code does not print the correct event messages when a player scores or is eliminated.
   - The final score is printed correctly, but the intermediate event messages are not.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
