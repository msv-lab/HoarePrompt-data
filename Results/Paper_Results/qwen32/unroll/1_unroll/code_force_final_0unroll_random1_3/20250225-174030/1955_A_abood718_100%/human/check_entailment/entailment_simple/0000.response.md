### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program to determine if it correctly computes the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts under promotion).

2. **Logic to Determine Minimum Cost:**
   - **Condition 1:** If the cost of buying two yogurts separately (`a * 2`) is less than the promotional price (`b`), it means that buying them separately is cheaper. Hence, the cost is `n * a`.
     - The program does not explicitly handle this case correctly. Instead, it checks if `b * 2 < c`, which is incorrect. It seems like a typo or a misunderstanding. The correct check should be `a * 2 < b`. However, given the context, it seems the intention was to check if `b < a * 2` to decide whether to use the promotion or not. Since the code does not handle this correctly, this needs to be fixed.
   - **Condition 2:** If `n` is even, the optimal way to buy the yogurts is to use the promotion for all pairs. Hence, the cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
     - The program correctly calculates this as `int(A * C / 2)` where `A` is `n` and `C` is `b`.
   - **Condition 3:** If `n` is odd, the optimal way is to use the promotion for as many pairs as possible and then buy the remaining yogurt at the regular price. Hence, the cost is `((n // 2) * b) + a`.
     - The program correctly calculates this as `X * C + B` where `X` is `n // 2`, `C` is `b`, and `B` is `a`.

However, the first condition is incorrectly implemented, which might lead to incorrect results in some cases. Let's correct this and re-evaluate:

- The correct first condition should be `if b < a * 2:` which means if buying two yogurts under promotion is cheaper than buying them separately, use the promotion as much as possible.

### Corrected Logic:
1. **If `b < a * 2`:**
   - If `n` is even, the cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
   - If `n` is odd, the cost is `((n // 2) * b) + a`.
2. **If `b >= a * 2`:**
   - The cost is simply `n * a`.

Given the corrected logic, the program needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the first condition.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided program does not correctly handle the first condition (`if b < a * 2:`), it may produce incorrect results in some cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
