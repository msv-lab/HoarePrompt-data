You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):

            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: All test cases have been processed and their respective outputs have been printed. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a number of test cases, each defined by three integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on specific conditions involving these integers. The input values remain unchanged after processing.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- The price for one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price for two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles.
- Determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy `n` yogurts.

### Key Observations:
1. **If `2 * a < b`:** It's cheaper to buy yogurts individually. Hence, the cost is `n * a`.
2. **If `2 * a >= b`:** It's cheaper or equally expensive to buy yogurts in pairs. 
   - If `n` is even, the cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
   - If `n` is odd, the cost is `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a` (buy as many pairs as possible and one individual yogurt).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows the above logic with the following steps:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Decision Making:**
   - It first checks if `2 * a < b`. If true, it calculates the cost as `n * a` and prints it.
   - If `2 * a >= b`, it checks if `n` is even. If true, it calculates the cost as `(n / 2) * b` and prints it.
   - If `n` is odd, it calculates the cost as `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a` and prints it.

### Code Review:
The code provided does not exactly match the decision-making logic described above. Specifically:
- The condition `if B * 2 < C` is correct for determining if buying individually is cheaper.
- However, the else part does not correctly handle the odd `n` case. Instead of checking if `n` is even or odd, it directly computes `X = A // 2` and prints `X * C + B`. This is incorrect because it doesn't properly handle the scenario where `n` is odd.

### Corrected Code:
To fix the code, we should properly handle the odd `n` case. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            # Calculate the number of pairs and the remaining yogurt
            pairs = A // 2
            remaining = A % 2
            print(pairs * C + remaining * B)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the improper handling of the odd `n` case. Therefore, the Correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
