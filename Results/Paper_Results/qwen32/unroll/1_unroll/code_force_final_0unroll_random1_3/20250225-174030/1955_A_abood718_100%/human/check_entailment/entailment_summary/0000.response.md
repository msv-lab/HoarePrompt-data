Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts given the price `a` for one yogurt and the price `b` for two yogurts under promotion. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts `n`, the price `a` for one yogurt, and the price `b` for two yogurts.
3. It then checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than the promotion price. If `2 * a < b`, it simply multiplies the number of yogurts `n` by the price `a` to get the total cost.
4. If the promotion is cheaper or equal in cost to buying two yogurts at regular price (`2 * a >= b`), it checks if `n` is even. If `n` is even, it calculates the cost by multiplying the number of pairs of yogurts (`n / 2`) by the promotion price `b`.
5. If `n` is odd, it calculates the cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible (`n // 2` pairs) at the promotion price `b` and then buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price `a`.

Let's verify this logic with the example provided:

- For the first test case (2 yogurts, 5 burles each, 9 burles for 2), it should output 9 because buying 2 yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper.
- For the second test case (3 yogurts, 5 burles each, 9 burles for 2), it should output 14 because buying 2 yogurts at the promotion price (9 burles) and 1 yogurt at the regular price (5 burles) results in a total of 14 burles.
- For the third test case (3 yogurts, 5 burles each, 11 burles for 2), it should output 15 because buying 2 yogurts at the promotion price (11 burles) and 1 yogurt at the regular price (5 burles) results in a total of 16 burles, but buying all 3 yogurts at the regular price (15 burles) is cheaper.
- For the fourth test case (4 yogurts, 5 burles each, 11 burles for 2), it should output 20 because buying 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price results in a total of 22 burles, but buying all 4 yogurts at the regular price (20 burles) is cheaper.

The program correctly implements the logic described and produces the correct output for the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
