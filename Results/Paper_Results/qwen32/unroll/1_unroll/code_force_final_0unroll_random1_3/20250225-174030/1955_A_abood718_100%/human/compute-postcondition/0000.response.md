The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is controlled by the `range` function that takes an integer input. The loop will execute if the input to `range` is greater than 0. 

Given the provided state, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30. The loop's execution depends on the value of `n` since `n` will be the input to the `range` function.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 1. Since `n` is already in the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), it will satisfy the condition for the loop to execute.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`, `a`, or `b` since they are not part of the loop head. The only relevant state is `n`, which must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 30, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 30**
