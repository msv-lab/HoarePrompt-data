Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation can be applied to indices from 2 to n-1, and it modifies the elements at positions i-1, i, and i+1.

The provided program includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's a detailed breakdown of each function and the overall logic:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the first `n` elements of the list are all zeros.
   - It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list and returns `False` if any element is not zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is designed to apply the specified operation to the list to try and make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the list from the second element to the second-to-last element (indices 1 to n-2).
   - For each element, it checks if the current element and its neighbors (i-1 and i+1) are greater than zero and if the current element is greater than 1.
   - If these conditions are met, it attempts to apply the operation. However, there is a critical mistake in the implementation of the operation:
     - Instead of subtracting 1, 2, and 1 from `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` respectively, it subtracts `list[i-1]`, `2*list[i-1]`, and `list[i-1]` from them. This is incorrect because it can reduce the values by more than the intended amount, potentially making them negative or zero prematurely.
   - After attempting to make the elements from index 1 to n-2 zero, it calls `func_1` to check if the first `n` elements are all zeros.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The mistake in `func_2` means that the operation is not applied correctly, and the function does not accurately determine if it's possible to make all elements zero. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
