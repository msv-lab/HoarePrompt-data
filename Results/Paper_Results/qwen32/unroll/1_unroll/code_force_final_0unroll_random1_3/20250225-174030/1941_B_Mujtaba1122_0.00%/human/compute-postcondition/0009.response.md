Functionality: **The function `func_2` takes a list of non-negative integers and its length `n` (where `n` is at least 3) as input. It modifies the list such that all elements from the second to the second-to-last become zero, while the first and last elements remain unchanged. It then checks a condition using `func_1` and prints 'YES' if the condition is true, otherwise 'NO'. The final state of the program is that the list has been modified as described, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed.**
