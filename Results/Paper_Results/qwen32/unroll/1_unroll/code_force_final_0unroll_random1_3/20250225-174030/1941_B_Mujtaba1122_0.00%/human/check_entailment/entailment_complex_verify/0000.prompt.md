You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    3
    
    7 1 0

    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list).
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: list is a list of integers where the first n elements are 0, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list). The function returns True.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function checks if the first `n` elements of the list are all zeros and returns `True` if they are, otherwise it returns `False`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers, and n is a positive integer such that n = len(list) and n >= 3.
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
    #State: list[0] is unchanged, list[1] to list[n-2] are all 0, list[n-1] is unchanged.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `list[0]` is unchanged, `list[1]` to `list[n-2]` are all 0, `list[n-1]` is unchanged, and `func_1(list, n)` evaluates to either true or false.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a list of non-negative integers and its length `n` (where `n` is at least 3) as input. It modifies the list such that all elements from the second to the second-to-last become zero, while the first and last elements remain unchanged. It then checks a condition using `func_1` and prints 'YES' if the condition is true, otherwise 'NO'. The final state of the program is that the list has been modified as described, and either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Operation Logic**:
   - In `func_2`, the operations are incorrectly applied. Specifically, the lines:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     These lines are incorrect because they subtract a multiple of `list[i - 1]` from the elements, which is not what the problem description specifies. The operations should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```

2. **Inefficient Looping**:
   - The loop in `func_2` only runs while `list[i] > 1`, but it should run while `list[i] >= 2` because the operation requires `list[i]` to be at least 2.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the array cannot be made zero, such as when the sum of the array elements is odd, as the total decrement must be even.

Let's consider a simple counterexample:

**Counterexample Input**:
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
YES
```

**Actual Output by the Program**:
```
NO
```

The actual output is incorrect because the program does not properly apply the operations to reduce the array to zeros. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def can_make_all_zeros(arr, n):
    # If the sum of the array is odd, it's impossible to make all elements zero
    if sum(arr) % 2 != 0:
        return "NO"
    
    # Try to make all elements zero using the described operation
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while arr[i] >= 2 and arr[i - 1] > 0 and arr[i + 1] > 0:
            arr[i - 1] -= 1
            arr[i] -= 2
            arr[i + 1] -= 1
    
    # Check if all elements are zero
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] != 0:
            return "NO"
    
    return "YES"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    t = int(input[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        arr = list(map(int, input[index + 1: index + 1 + n]))
        results.append(can_make_all_zeros(arr, n))
        index += 1 + n
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage
main()
```

This corrected version properly applies the operations and checks if all elements can be made zero.
