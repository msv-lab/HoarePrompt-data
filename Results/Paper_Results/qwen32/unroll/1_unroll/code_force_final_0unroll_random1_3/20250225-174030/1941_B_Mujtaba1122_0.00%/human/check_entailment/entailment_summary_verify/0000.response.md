**Reasoning:**

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues in the provided program and confirm why it is incorrect based on the function summary and problem description.

### Issues in the Provided Program

1. **Incorrect Operation Logic:**
   - The operations in `func_2` are incorrectly implemented. Specifically, the lines:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     These lines should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```
     The current implementation incorrectly multiplies the decrements by the value of `list[i - 1]`, which is not what the problem description specifies.

2. **Inefficient Looping:**
   - The loop in `func_2` only runs while `list[i] > 1`, but it should run while `list[i] >= 2` because the operation requires `list[i]` to be at least 2.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the array cannot be made zero, such as when the sum of the array elements is odd. The total decrement must be even to make all elements zero, but the provided program does not check this condition.

### Function Summary Validation

The function summary suggests that `func_2` modifies the list such that all elements from the second to the second-to-last become zero, while the first and last elements remain unchanged. It then checks if the list is all zeros using `func_1` and prints 'YES' or 'NO'. However, the actual implementation of `func_2` does not correctly apply the operations as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness of the Program

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
