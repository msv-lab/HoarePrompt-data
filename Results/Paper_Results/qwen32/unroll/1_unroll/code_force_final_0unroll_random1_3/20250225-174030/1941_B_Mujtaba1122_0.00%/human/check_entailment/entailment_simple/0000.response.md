### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by iteratively applying the described operation to make all elements of the array zero. However, there are several issues in the implementation that make the program incorrect.

1. **Incorrect Operation Application:**
   - The program's logic for applying the operation is flawed. Specifically, the lines:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     incorrectly assume that the entire value of `list[i - 1]` can be subtracted from itself and the other elements. The correct operation should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```
     The operation should be applied as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0`.

2. **Inadequate Check for Zero Elements:**
   - After applying the operations, the program checks if all elements are zero using `func_1`. However, the current implementation of `func_1` only checks the first `n` elements, which is unnecessary since `n` is the length of the list. Moreover, the function does not correctly handle the state of the list after the operations. The list should be checked entirely to ensure all elements are zero.

3. **Inability to Handle All Cases:**
   - The current approach does not guarantee that all elements can be made zero for all possible inputs. For example, if the array has a configuration where the middle elements cannot be reduced to zero without affecting the boundary elements, the program might incorrectly return "YES".

### Correctness:

Given the issues described above, the program is not correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
