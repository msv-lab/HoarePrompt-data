Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given inputs, representing the result of some computation involving the vertices and the value `y`. The final output for each test case is the minimum of the computed value and `n - 2`.**
