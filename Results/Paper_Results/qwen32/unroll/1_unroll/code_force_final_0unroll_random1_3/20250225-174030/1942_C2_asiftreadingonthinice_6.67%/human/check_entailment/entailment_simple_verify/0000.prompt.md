You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Handling of Gaps Between Chosen Vertices:**
   - The code attempts to handle gaps between chosen vertices by checking if the difference between consecutive vertices is 2 or even. However, it incorrectly uses `a[i] - a[i - 1]` in the final conditional statement outside the loop, which leads to incorrect calculations.
   - Specifically, `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` are used outside the loop, which is incorrect since `i` is out of scope after the loop ends. This would raise an `IndexError`.

2. **Circular Nature of the Polygon:**
   - The code correctly handles the circular nature of the polygon by checking the gap between the first and last chosen vertices. However, it uses the same incorrect logic as above, using `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` outside the loop, which is incorrect.

3. **Maximizing Triangular Pieces:**
   - The logic for maximizing triangular pieces is flawed. The code does not correctly account for the number of additional vertices that can be chosen (`y`) to form more triangles. Specifically, it does not correctly distribute the additional vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle edge cases where the chosen vertices are very close together or spread out in a way that does not allow for additional vertices to form more triangles.

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
8 4 2
1 3 5 7
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Chosen vertices: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Gaps between chosen vertices: 2 (between 1 and 3), 2 (between 3 and 5), 2 (between 5 and 7), 2 (between 7 and 1)
- Each gap of 2 can be used to form 1 triangle, and with 4 gaps, we can form 4 triangles.
- With 2 additional vertices, we can form 2 more triangles, leading to a total of 6 triangles.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
- The program will likely raise an `IndexError` due to the incorrect use of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` outside the loop.
- Even if the program does not raise an error, it will not correctly calculate the number of triangles due to the flawed logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
