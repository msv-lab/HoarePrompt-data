### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the functions and their roles in the program to determine if they collectively meet the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to set all elements in the subarray `a[l:r+1]` to the value `r - l + 1` if the element at index `l` is not already equal to that value.
   - It records these modifications in the `ops` list.
   - The purpose of this function is to maximize the sum of the array by replacing elements with the highest possible MEX value for the subarray.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calls `recursive_maximize_sum` and then returns the sum of the array `a`, the number of operations performed, and the list of operations.
   - It initializes the `ops` list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` with the full range of the array.
   - The purpose of this function is to orchestrate the process of maximizing the sum of the array and collecting the operations performed.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function is responsible for recursively dividing the array into subarrays and applying the MEX operation to maximize the sum.
   - It checks if the sum of the elements in the subarray `a[l:r+1]` is less than or equal to the square of the subarray's length. If true, it applies the MEX operation to set all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1`.
   - If the sum is greater, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of this maximum element.
   - The purpose of this function is to strategically apply the MEX operation to maximize the sum of the array.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to compute the maximum sum and the operations, and then prints the results.
   - It converts the 0-based indices in `ops` to 1-based indices for the output as required by the problem description.
   - The purpose of this function is to handle input/output operations and ensure the final output meets the problem's requirements.

### Analysis:

- **Recursive Strategy**: The recursive strategy in `recursive_maximize_sum` is sound. It ensures that the MEX operation is applied optimally by dividing the array into subarrays around the maximum element and applying the operation only when necessary.
- **Operation Recording**: The operations are recorded correctly in the `ops` list, which is then used to output the sequence of operations.
- **Output**: The output format is correct, with the sum and the number of operations printed first, followed by the operations in the required format.
- **Edge Cases**: The functions handle edge cases such as arrays of length 1, arrays with all elements equal, and arrays with distinct elements.

### Conclusion:

The functions collectively meet the problem description by maximizing the sum of the array and providing a valid sequence of operations. Therefore, the program is correct.
