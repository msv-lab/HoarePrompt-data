Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < n, where n is the length of the array `a`. If `s` (the sum of the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` inclusive) is less than or equal to (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), then `ops` is a list that includes the tuple `(l, r)` as its last element and the elements of `a` from index `l` to `r` are all set to `r - l + 1`. Otherwise, `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), `mx` is the maximum value in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`, and `pos` is the index of `mx` in the array `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been executed, and `pos` remains the index of the maximum value in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`. If `pos` is equal to `r`, no further action is taken.**
