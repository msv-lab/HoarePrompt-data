Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem based on the given description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(a, l, r, ops)`**:
   - This function is supposed to handle the case when the segment from `l` to `r` is processed.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not zero, sets `a[l]` to zero, and records the operation.
   - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `l + 1` to `r`, and then checks if the current segment's MEX is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If not, it sets the entire segment to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
   - **Issue**: This function seems to assume that the MEX of the segment is always `r - l + 1` if it's not zero, which is not necessarily true. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the segment, not necessarily `r - l + 1`.

2. **Function `func_2(a)`**:
   - This function initializes the operations list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.
   - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the operations list.
   - **Issue**: `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `a` and `ops` lists, which means it won't modify the array or the operations list as intended.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`**:
   - This function is supposed to recursively split the array and maximize the sum by finding the MEX.
   - It calculates the sum of the segment and checks if it's less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If so, it calls `func_1` and sets the entire segment to `r - l + 1`.
   - If the sum condition is not met, it finds the maximum element in the segment and recursively processes the segments before and after the maximum element.
   - **Issue**: Similar to `func_1`, the logic for determining the MEX seems incorrect. The function `func_1` is called without passing `a` and `ops` properly.

4. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.
   - **Issue**: Since `func_2` does not correctly call `recursive_maximize_sum` with the necessary parameters, the entire logic is flawed.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX and maximize the sum of the array. The recursive functions are not properly passing the necessary parameters, and the logic for determining the MEX is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
