The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `a`. This means the initial value of `a` is overwritten by the new list of integers provided by the user input.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, where each integer is between 0 and 10^7; `n` is the length of the list `a`.**
