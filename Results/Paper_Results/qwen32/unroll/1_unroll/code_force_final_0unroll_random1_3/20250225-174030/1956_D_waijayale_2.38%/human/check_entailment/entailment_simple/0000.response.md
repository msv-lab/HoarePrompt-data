### Reasoning:

The given program aims to maximize the sum of the array `a` by performing a series of operations where each operation sets a subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of that subarray. The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to set all elements in a subarray `a[l:r+1]` to `r-l+1` if the current sum of this subarray is less than `(r-l+1)*(r-l+1)`.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if the element at `a[l]` is not zero and sets it to zero if necessary.
   - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself to process the subarray `a[l+1:r+1]` and then checks if the element at `a[l]` is not equal to `r-l+1`. If so, it sets the entire subarray `a[l:r+1]` to `r-l+1` and records the operation.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array.
   - It then returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the operations list.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function recursively processes the array to maximize its sum.
   - It calculates the sum `s` of the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.
   - If `s` is less than or equal to `(r-l+1)*(r-l+1)`, it calls `func_1` to set the subarray to `r-l+1`.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element `mx` and its position `pos` in the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.
   - It recursively processes the left subarray `a[l:pos-1]` and the right subarray `a[pos+1:r]` if necessary.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to process the array, and prints the maximum sum and the operations.

### Analysis:

- **Maximizing the Sum**: The program aims to set each subarray to the highest possible value that is not already present in the subarray. This is achieved by setting the subarray to `r-l+1` if the current sum is less than `(r-l+1)*(r-l+1)`.
- **Correctness of Operations**: The operations are correctly recorded and applied to maximize the sum of the array.
- **Output**: The output format matches the problem's requirement, providing the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations and recording them appropriately. The provided examples and the logic within the functions align with the problem description.

**Correctness: **True**
