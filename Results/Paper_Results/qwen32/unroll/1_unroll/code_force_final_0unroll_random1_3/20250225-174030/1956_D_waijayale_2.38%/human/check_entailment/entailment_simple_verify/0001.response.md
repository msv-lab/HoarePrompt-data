### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have an array of integers.
- We can perform operations to set all elements in a subarray to the MEX of that subarray.
- Our goal is to maximize the sum of the array and provide the sequence of operations.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is supposed to set all elements in the subarray `[l, r]` to the MEX of that subarray.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not zero and sets it to zero, appending the operation to `ops`.
   - If `l != r`, it recursively calls itself on the subarray `[l + 1, r]`.
   - After the recursive call, it checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1` (which is supposed to be the MEX), and if so, sets all elements in `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Initializes `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum`.
   - Returns the sum of the array and the number of operations.

3. **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**:
   - This function is supposed to maximize the sum of the array by recursively dividing it into subarrays.
   - It checks if the sum of the subarray `[l, r]` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If true, it calls `func_1` to set all elements to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation.
   - If the sum is greater, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays before and after this maximum element.

4. **Function 4 (`func_3`)**:
   - Reads input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the sum and operations.

#### Issues Identified:

- **Scope and Variable Passing**:
  - `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing `a` and `ops`. This will lead to a `NameError` because `recursive_maximize_sum` tries to modify `a` and `ops` which are not in its scope.
  
- **MEX Calculation**:
  - The program incorrectly assumes that setting the subarray to `r - l + 1` is always the optimal solution. This is not true as the MEX of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, which might not always be `r - l + 1`.

- **Recursive Logic**:
  - The function does not correctly handle the base case when `l == r`.
  - The logic for splitting the subarray around the maximum element is flawed. It does not guarantee that the MEX is calculated correctly.

- **Operation List**:
  - The operations list `ops` is not correctly managed, leading to incorrect or missing operations.

#### Annotations Evaluation:

The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, but they do not address the fundamental issues with the logic and variable scope.

#### Conclusion:

The program contains several critical issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem. The logic for calculating the MEX and handling operations is flawed, and the program does not correctly manage the operations list or variable scope.

**Final: False**
