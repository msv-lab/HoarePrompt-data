The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The state of `t` is already given as an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Since the state of `t` already ensures that the loop will execute (as it is within the specified range), no adjustment is needed for `t`. The state of `_` does not need to be considered for adjustment as it is not used within the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
