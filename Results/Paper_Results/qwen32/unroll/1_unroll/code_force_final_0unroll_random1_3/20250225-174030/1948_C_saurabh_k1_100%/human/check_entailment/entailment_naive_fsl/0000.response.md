Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The robot can move in four directions and then follow the arrow in the current cell. The given code only checks a very limited set of conditions and does not account for the full movement rules or all possible paths.

Let's consider a test case that demonstrates the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
6
><><><
><><><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Test Case:**
The robot can follow this path: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (1, 4) -> (1, 5) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6). Thus, the correct output should be "YES".

However, the provided code will output "NO" for this test case because it only checks specific conditions related to the arrows at positions i and i+1 or i and i-1, which are not sufficient to determine the full path.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all possible paths and movement rules correctly.
