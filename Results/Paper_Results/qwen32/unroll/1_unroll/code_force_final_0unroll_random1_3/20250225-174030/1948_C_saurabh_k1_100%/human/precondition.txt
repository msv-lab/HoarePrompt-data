t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The first and second lines of each test case contain strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, representing the directions of the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
