Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The conditions for the test cases (each with an integer n and two strings of length n) remain unchanged.**

In simpler terms, `t` has been assigned the value of the number of test cases, but the rest of the initial state remains the same.
