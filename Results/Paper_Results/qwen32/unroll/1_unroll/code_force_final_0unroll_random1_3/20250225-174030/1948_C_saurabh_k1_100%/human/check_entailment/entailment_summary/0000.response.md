### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided solution.

**Problem Analysis:**

- The robot starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n).
- The robot moves in two steps each second: a free move and then a move following the arrow in the current cell.
- The robot cannot move outside the grid or skip a move.
- The grid has two rows, and each cell contains an arrow pointing either left ('<') or right ('>').

**Key Observations:**

- Since the robot starts at the top-left corner and needs to reach the bottom-right corner, it must eventually move down from row 1 to row 2 at some point.
- The robot can only move down from row 1 to row 2 if it is in a column where the arrow in row 1 points down (i.e., it points to the right, and there is a corresponding right-pointing arrow in row 2 in the next column).

**Solution Analysis:**

The provided solution checks for a specific pattern in the grid to determine if the robot can reach (2, n). Specifically, it checks for two consecutive columns `i` and `i+1` in the grid where both columns have '<' in row 1 and row 2, or row 1 has '<' in column `i` and row 2 has '<' in column `i-1`. If such a pattern is found, it prints 'No' because it indicates a dead end where the robot cannot proceed further.

However, this logic does not fully capture all scenarios where the robot might be unable to reach (2, n). For example, it does not consider cases where the robot might be trapped in a loop or where there are no valid paths to move down to the second row.

**Counterexample:**

Consider the following test case:

```
2
4
><<>
><><
```

- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It can move to (1, 2) and then follow the '>' to (1, 3).
- From (1, 3), it can move to (1, 4) and then follow the '<' to (1, 3).
- The robot is now trapped in a loop and cannot reach (2, 4).

The provided solution would incorrectly output 'Yes' for this case because it does not detect the loop.

**Conclusion:**

The given solution is not comprehensive and does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach (2, n) for all possible grid configurations. Thus, the solution is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
