The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (where `n` is even) and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. The functionality of the function is to handle multiple test cases, each involving a pair of strings of arrows, and return a corresponding result based on the configuration of the arrows for each case.
