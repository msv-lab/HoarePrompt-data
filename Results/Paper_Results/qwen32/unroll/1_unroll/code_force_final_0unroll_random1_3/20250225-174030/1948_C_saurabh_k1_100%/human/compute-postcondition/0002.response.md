To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the given code. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b`, both of length `n`. It then checks for specific conditions in the strings and prints either "No" or "Yes" based on those conditions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**: The loop initializes with `t` test cases.
2. **For each test case**:
   - It reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It iterates over the indices of `a` and `b` starting from 1 to `n-1` with a step of 2 (i.e., it checks only the odd indices).
   - For each odd index `i`, it checks if either:
     - `i + 1 < n` and both `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are '<'.
     - `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are '<'.
   - If either of these conditions is true, it prints "No" and breaks out of the inner loop.
   - If none of these conditions are true for any `i`, it prints "Yes" after the inner loop completes.

After all test cases have been processed, the state of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` will reflect the last test case processed. The variables `i` and the loop control variables will not persist outside the loop, so they do not affect the output state.

Output State: **After processing all test cases, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` will hold the values from the last test case. The loop control variables (`_` and `i`) will not be accessible outside the loop.**
