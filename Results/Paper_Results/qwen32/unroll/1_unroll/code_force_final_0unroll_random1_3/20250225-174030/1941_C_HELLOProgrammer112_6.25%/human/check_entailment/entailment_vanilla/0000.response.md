Reasoning:  
The provided program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string and outputs the sum of these counts as the number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. However, this approach is incorrect because simply counting the substrings does not account for overlapping substrings or the possibility of removing characters that would prevent the formation of multiple substrings with fewer deletions.

For example, consider the string "mappie". The program would count one "map" and one "pie", resulting in a total of 2 deletions. However, by deleting only the character 'a' at index 2, we can make the string "mpie", which is beautiful, requiring only 1 deletion.

The program does not consider such optimal deletion strategies and thus does not always produce the correct minimum number of deletions.

Correctness: **False**
