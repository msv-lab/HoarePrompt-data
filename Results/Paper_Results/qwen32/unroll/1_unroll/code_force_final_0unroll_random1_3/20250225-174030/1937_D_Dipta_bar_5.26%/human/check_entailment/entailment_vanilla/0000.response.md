Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

### Analysis of the Program

The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of a string `s` of length `n` where each character is either '<' or '>'. The program aims to compute the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

### Key Components of the Program

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the grid configuration `s`.

2. **Processing the Grid:**
   - Two lists `A` and `B` are used to store intermediate results.
   - `idx_A` and `idx_B` store indices of '>' and '<' respectively.
   - Two loops iterate over the grid to populate `A` and `B` based on the positions of '>' and '<'.

3. **Calculating Results:**
   - Two pointers `l` and `r` are used to track the indices of processed elements in `A` and `B`.
   - For each cell, the program calculates the number of steps required for the pinball to leave the grid based on the current character and the values in `A` and `B`.

### Correctness of the Program

The provided program seems to be quite complex and involves intricate calculations involving multiple lists and indices. However, the logic appears to be based on the idea of tracking the cumulative effects of character inversions and the movements of the pinball.

### Potential Issues

Upon closer inspection, there are several issues that could lead to incorrect results:

1. **Inconsistent Indexing:**
   - The program uses both 0-based and 1-based indexing inconsistently, which could lead to off-by-one errors.

2. **Complex Calculations:**
   - The calculations involving `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` are quite complex and involve nested conditions and arithmetic operations. These calculations are not trivial and could easily contain bugs.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not explicitly handle edge cases such as grids with all '<' or all '>', which might require specific handling.

4. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program prints the results for each query on the same line separated by spaces. However, it does not handle the case where the output should be separated by a newline after each test case, which is implied by the problem statement.

### Conclusion

Given the complexity of the calculations and the potential for off-by-one errors and other logical issues, it is difficult to confidently assert that the program is correct without rigorous testing and verification.

**Correctness: False**

The program may not handle all edge cases correctly, and the complex calculations could contain bugs. Therefore, the program is likely incorrect.
