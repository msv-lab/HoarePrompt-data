The initial state describes the elements of `mex` being printed in a single line, separated by spaces. However, the provided Python code snippet is an empty `print()` statement without any arguments.

Given the information:
- The `mex` list is mentioned in the initial state, but it is not used or referenced in the provided code snippet.
- The `print()` statement is empty and does not contain any arguments to print.

Therefore, the `print()` statement will produce no output.

Output: **(an empty line)**
