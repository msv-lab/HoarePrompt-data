To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's break down the operations performed in the loop:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (unchanged).
   - `n` is the integer value read from the input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 (unchanged).
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each `arr_i` satisfies -n ≤ `arr_i` ≤ n (unchanged).
   - `mex` is an empty list.
   - `minn` is 0.
   - `used` is an empty dictionary.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in `arr`:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive:
       - Append `minn` to the `mex` list.
       - Mark `minn` as used in the `used` dictionary.
       - Increment `minn` until it finds the next unused number.
     - If `arr[i]` is non-positive:
       - Compute the absolute difference `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
       - Append this value to the `mex` list.
       - Mark this value as used in the `used` dictionary.

After the loop finishes, the `mex` list will contain `n` elements, each representing the smallest non-negative integer not used up to that point, considering the rules defined in the loop. The `minn` variable will hold the smallest non-negative integer not yet used after processing all elements. The `used` dictionary will reflect all the integers that have been used during the loop.

**Output State**: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value read from the input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each `arr_i` satisfies -n ≤ `arr_i` ≤ n; `mex` is a list of `n` integers representing the smallest non-negative integers not used at each step; `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer not used after processing all elements; `used` is a dictionary of integers that have been used.**
