The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `arr`. This means that the list `arr` will now hold the integers that were inputted.

Since `n` is the integer value read from the input which specifies the number of integers in the list `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers, the list `arr` will replace the list `a` with the new list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value read from the input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each `arr_i` satisfies -n ≤ `arr_i` ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
