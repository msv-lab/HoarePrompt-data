To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over the `mex` list.

The loop statement is:
```python
for itm in mex:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `itm`, which is an element of the `mex` list. For the loop to execute, the `mex` list must have at least one element.

Let's analyze the given state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the integer value read from the input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each `arr_i` satisfies -n ≤ `arr_i` ≤ n
- `mex` is a list of `n` integers computed based on the loop conditions
- `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex`
- `used` is a dictionary of all unique values in `mex`

Since the loop depends on the `mex` list, we need to ensure that `mex` has at least one element for the loop to execute. The state of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `minn`, and `used` do not directly affect the execution of the loop as per the loop head.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `mex` has at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value read from the input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each `arr_i` satisfies -n ≤ `arr_i` ≤ n, `mex` is a list of `n` integers with at least one element, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex`, `used` is a dictionary of all unique values in `mex`**
