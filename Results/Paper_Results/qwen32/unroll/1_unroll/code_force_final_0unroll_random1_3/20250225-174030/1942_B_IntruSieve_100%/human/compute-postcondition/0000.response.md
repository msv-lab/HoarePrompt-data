The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`, which means the variable `n` will be assigned the integer value obtained from the input. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. After executing the code, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer value read from the input, but the constraints on `n` remain the same. The other variables `t` and `a` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value read from the input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
