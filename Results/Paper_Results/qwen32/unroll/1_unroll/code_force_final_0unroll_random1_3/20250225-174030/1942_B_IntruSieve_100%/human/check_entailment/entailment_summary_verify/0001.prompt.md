You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It computes a list `mex` based on the values in `arr` and prints the elements of `mex` in a single line, separated by spaces. Each element in `mex` is determined by the smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex` up to that point or the absolute difference between the current element in `arr` and the smallest non-negative integer not used, depending on whether the current element is positive or not. After processing the list, it prints an empty line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to construct a permutation `p` of size `n` based on an array `a` of size `n`.
- The relationship between `a` and `p` is given by `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- `MEX` of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- We need to find at least one valid `p` for the given `a`.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps for each test case:
1. Read the size `n` of the array `a`.
2. Read the array `a` of length `n`.
3. Initialize an empty list `mex` to store the permutation `p`.
4. Initialize `minn` to 0, which will keep track of the smallest unused number.
5. Initialize a dictionary `used` to keep track of which numbers have been used in the permutation.
6. Iterate through each element in `a`:
   - If `a[i]` is positive, append `minn` to `mex` and mark `minn` as used. Then, increment `minn` until it points to the next unused number.
   - If `a[i]` is non-positive, append `abs(a[i] - minn)` to `mex` and mark this number as used.
7. Print the permutation `mex` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
The core issue with the program is the incorrect logic used to determine the permutation `p`. The key mistake is in handling the case when `a[i]` is non-positive. The program incorrectly calculates `p_i` as `abs(a[i] - minn)`, which does not guarantee that the resulting `p` will satisfy the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly construct the permutation `p`:
1. Initialize `mex` to 0 and an empty set `used` to keep track of used numbers.
2. For each `a[i]`, calculate the correct `p_i` as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.
3. Ensure that `p_i` is a valid number (i.e., not already used and within the range `[0, n-1]`).
4. Update `mex` to the next unused number after adding `p_i` to the permutation.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to construct the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
