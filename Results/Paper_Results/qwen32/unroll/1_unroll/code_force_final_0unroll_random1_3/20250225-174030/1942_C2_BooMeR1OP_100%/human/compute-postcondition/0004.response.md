Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` based on the given inputs and constraints. The value `ans` is determined by evaluating the gaps between the integers in the list and adjusting it according to the value of `y`.**
