Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Final destination on the number line.
     - `k`: Number of known points (excluding the starting point).
     - `q`: Number of queries.
     - `a`: List of `k+1` points on the number line (including the starting point 0 and ending point `n`).
     - `b`: List of `k+1` times at which the car reaches each point in `a`.
     - `d`: List of `q` queries, each representing a point on the number line.

2. **Output:**
   - For each query `d`, output the time it takes for the car to reach point `d`, rounded down to the nearest integer.

3. **Constraints:**
   - `1 <= t <= 10^4`
   - `k <= n <= 10^9`
   - `1 <= k, q <= 10^5`
   - The sequences `a` and `b` are strictly increasing, with `a_k = n`.

### Solution Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - It reads the list of points `a` and the list of times `b`.
   - It initializes additional lists `ad` and `bd` to store the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It calculates the speed `v` between each pair of consecutive points using the formula `v = (a[i] - a[i-1]) / (b[i] - b[i-1])`.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query `d`, it finds the index `s` in the list `a` where `d` would be inserted to maintain the order.
   - If `d` is exactly at a known point `a[s]`, it directly outputs the corresponding time `b[s]`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time to reach `d` by:
     - Adding the time to reach the previous known point `b[s-1]`.
     - Calculating the time to travel the remaining distance from `a[s-1]` to `d` at the speed `v[s]`.
   - It outputs the total time rounded down using `int(m)`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program correctly initializes the lists `ad`, `bd`, and `v` to store the differences and speeds between consecutive points.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - The use of `bisect_left` to find the appropriate segment for each query is correct.
   - The calculation of the time to reach a point `d` is correct:
     - If `d` is exactly at a known point, it directly outputs the corresponding time.
     - If `d` is between two known points, it calculates the time to reach `d` by adding the time to the previous known point and the time to travel the remaining distance at the appropriate speed.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles the input and output requirements as per the problem description. It efficiently calculates the time to reach each query point using the given information about the car's movement.

**Correctness: True**
