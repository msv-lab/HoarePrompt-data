The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `k`, and `q`, lists `a` and `b` of `k` integers each, and a list `d` of `q` integers. It computes and prints a list of `q` values, where each value is determined based on the provided lists `a` and `b` for each query in `d`.
