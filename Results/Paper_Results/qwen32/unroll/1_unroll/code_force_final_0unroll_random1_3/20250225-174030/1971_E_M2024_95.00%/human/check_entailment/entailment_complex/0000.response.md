### Reasoning:
The program correctly processes each test case by calculating the time it takes for the car to reach each query point `d` based on the provided information about the car's journey. Here is a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`, representing the final destination, the number of known points, and the number of queries, respectively.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b`, which represent the positions and times at which the car reaches each known point, respectively.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The program calculates the differences between consecutive positions (`ad`) and times (`bd`).
   - It calculates the speed `v` for each segment between consecutive points using the formula `v[i] = ad[i] / bd[i]`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `ql`, the program finds the segment in which `ql` lies using `bisect_left`.
   - If `ql` exactly matches a known point, the program directly outputs the corresponding time from `b`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time taken to reach `ql` from the previous known point using the speed of that segment and adds it to the time taken to reach the previous known point.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated time for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and constraints. It accurately calculates the time for each query based on the provided data and handles edge cases such as queries that exactly match known points. The use of `bisect_left` ensures efficient searching for the segment in which each query point lies.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
