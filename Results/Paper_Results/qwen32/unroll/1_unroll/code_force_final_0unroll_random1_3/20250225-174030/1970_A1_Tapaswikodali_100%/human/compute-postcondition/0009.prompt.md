You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and s is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects where each object contains the balance at the start of each character's position in `s`, the index of the character, and the character itself; `balance` is 0.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: - The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result` which is a rearrangement of the characters in the original string `s` based on the specified sorting criteria of `balance_info`.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #The output will be the string `result`, which is a rearrangement of the characters in the original string `s` sorted by the cumulative balance and position as described.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns an integer representing the maximum depth of nested parentheses in the string.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
