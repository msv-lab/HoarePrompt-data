### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a balanced parentheses sequence `s`.
   - The task is to perform a "balanced shuffle" operation on `s` to produce a new sequence `t`.
   - The balanced shuffle operation involves:
     - Calculating the balance of the prefix of the sequence before each character.
     - Creating a list of objects (`BalanceInfo`) containing the balance, position, and character.
     - Sorting this list based on balance in ascending order, and in case of ties, by position in descending order.
     - Constructing the new sequence `t` from the sorted list of characters.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function is used as a key for sorting the `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - It compares the `balance` of two objects. If they differ, it returns the difference. If they are the same, it returns a negative difference of their `position` (to sort in descending order of position).
     - This function correctly implements the sorting criteria specified in the problem statement.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function takes the input string `s`, calculates the balance for each prefix, and creates a list of `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - It sorts this list using `func_1` as the key.
     - It constructs and prints the new sequence `t` by joining the characters of the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - This function correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

3. **Verification:**
   - Given the example input `(()(()))`:
     - The prefix balances and positions are calculated as follows:
       ```
       Prefix balance | 0 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1
       Position       | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7
       Character      | ( | ( | ) | ( | ( | ) | ) | )
       ```
     - Sorting by balance and position (descending on tie) gives:
       ```
       Prefix balance | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3
       Position       | 0 | 7 | 3 | 1 | 6 | 4 | 2 | 5
       Character      | ( | ) | ( | ( | ) | ( | ) | )
       ```
     - The resulting sequence `t` is `()(()())`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Both `func_1` and `func_2` work as intended, and the example provided confirms the correctness of the implementation.

**Correctness: True**
