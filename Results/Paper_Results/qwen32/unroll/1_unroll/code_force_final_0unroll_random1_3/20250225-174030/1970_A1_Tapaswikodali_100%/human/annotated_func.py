#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence and 'position' is an integer representing the position of the character in the sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between infoA.balance and infoB.balance
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence and 'position' is an integer representing the position of the character in the sequence. The balance of infoA is equal to the balance of infoB.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `infoA` and `infoB`, which are objects with attributes 'balance' and 'position'. It returns the difference between `infoA.balance` and `infoB.balance` if their balances are not equal, and returns 0 if their balances are equal.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and s is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects where each object contains the balance at the start of each character's position in `s`, the index of the character, and the character itself; `balance` is 0.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: - The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result` which is a rearrangement of the characters in the original string `s` based on the specified sorting criteria of `balance_info`.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #The output will be the string `result`, which is a rearrangement of the characters in the original string `s` sorted by the cumulative balance and position as described.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function prints a rearranged version of the string `s` based on the cumulative balance and position of each character. The function does not return any value.
