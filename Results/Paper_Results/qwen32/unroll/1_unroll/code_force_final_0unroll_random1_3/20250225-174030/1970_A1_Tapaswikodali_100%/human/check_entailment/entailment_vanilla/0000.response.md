To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the logic and compare it against the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Balance Calculation**: For each character in the input string, calculate the balance of the prefix before that character.
2. **Sorting**: Sort the characters based on their prefix balance in increasing order. If two characters have the same prefix balance, sort them in decreasing order of their positions.
3. **Result Construction**: Construct the final string from the sorted list of characters.

### Provided Program Breakdown:
1. **Balance Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the balance for each prefix by iterating through the string and updating the balance based on whether the current character is '(' or ')'.
2. **Sorting**: The program uses a custom sorting function `func_1` which sorts primarily by the balance and secondarily by the negative position (to achieve the decreasing order of positions when balances are the same). However, this custom function is not used directly in the sorting key. Instead, the lambda function `lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position)` is used, which effectively does the same thing.
3. **Result Construction**: The program constructs the final string by joining the characters from the sorted list.

### Class Definition:
The program references a class `BalanceInfo` which is not provided in the given code snippet. However, based on the usage, it is assumed that `BalanceInfo` is a class with attributes `balance`, `position`, and `character`.

### Verification:
- The balance calculation is correct.
- The sorting criteria match the problem description.
- The result construction is correct.

Since the program correctly implements the steps described in the problem, it is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
