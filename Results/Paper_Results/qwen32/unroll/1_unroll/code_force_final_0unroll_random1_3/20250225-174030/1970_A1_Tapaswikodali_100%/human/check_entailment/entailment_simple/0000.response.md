### Reasoning:
The provided Python program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Class Definition (`BalanceInfo`)**:
   - The `BalanceInfo` class is used to store the balance of a prefix, the position of the character in the sequence, and the character itself.
   - This class helps in maintaining the necessary information for sorting the characters based on their prefix balance and position.

2. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads a balanced parentheses sequence `s` from the input.
   - It calculates the balance of the prefix for each character in the sequence and stores this information in a list of `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - The balance is updated by incrementing it for each opening parenthesis `(` and decrementing it for each closing parenthesis `)`.
   - The list `balance_info` is then sorted using a custom key. The key sorts primarily by the balance in ascending order and secondarily by the position in descending order (achieved by negating the position).
   - After sorting, the characters are joined in the new order to form the balanced shuffle sequence, which is then printed.

3. **Sorting Function (`func_1`)**:
   - Although the sorting logic is defined in `func_1`, it is not directly used in the provided code. Instead, the sorting is done using a lambda function within `func_2`.
   - The lambda function correctly implements the sorting criteria described in the problem statement.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - The example provided in the problem statement (`(()(()))`) is correctly processed by the program. The sorted sequence based on the prefix balance and position is `()(()())`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It calculates the prefix balance for each character, sorts the characters based on the specified criteria, and outputs the resulting balanced shuffle sequence.

**Correctness: True**
