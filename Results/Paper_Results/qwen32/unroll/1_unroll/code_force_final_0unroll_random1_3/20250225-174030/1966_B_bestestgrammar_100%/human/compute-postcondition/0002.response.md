To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the logic of the provided code. The code processes multiple test cases where each test case involves a grid of characters 'W' and 'B'. For each grid, it checks if it's possible to color the grid such that:

1. The top-left corner and the bottom-right corner have the same color.
2. If the top-left corner and bottom-right corner have different colors, then:
   - No two adjacent cells in the first row can have different colors.
   - No two adjacent cells in the last row can have different colors.
   - No two adjacent cells in the first column can have different colors.
   - No two adjacent cells in the last column can have different colors.

If these conditions are met, the answer is 'YES'; otherwise, it's 'NO'. The output for each test case is printed individually.

Given the initial state and the provided code, the output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' answers, one for each test case. Since the initial state only specifies the number of test cases and the dimensions and contents of the grids, we cannot determine the exact sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' without the specific input data. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the format and the conditions that determine each answer.

Output State: **A series of 'YES' or 'NO' answers, one for each test case, based on the conditions specified in the code.**
