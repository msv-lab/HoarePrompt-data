### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using a specific operation. The operation allows coloring all squares in a subrectangle to a given color if the subrectangle corners are of the same color.

The given solution checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid have the same color. If they do not, it then checks if the first row and the last row are uniform (all squares in the row are the same color) and if the first column and the last column are uniform. If both conditions are true, it still concludes that it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color.

However, this logic is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Top-left and Bottom-right Check**: The check for `gr[0][0]` and `gr[n-1][m-1]` being different is correct. If these corners are different, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color unless the rest of the grid can be manipulated to match one of these colors.
2. **Row and Column Uniformity Check**: The check for uniformity in the first and last rows and columns is not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform. The grid can have different patterns that do not violate the first and last row/column being uniform but still cannot be made uniform overall.

For example, consider a grid:
```
BB
WW
BB
WW
```
Here, the first and last rows and columns are uniform, but the entire grid cannot be made uniform because the pattern alternates between rows and columns.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly determine if the entire grid can be made uniform. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
