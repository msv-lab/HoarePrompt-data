The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, as `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `t`. The variable `i` is the loop variable and is initialized automatically by the `range` function, so we don't need to set it before the loop starts.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state so that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is the integer input by the user, representing the number of test cases, and `t` must be greater than 0**
