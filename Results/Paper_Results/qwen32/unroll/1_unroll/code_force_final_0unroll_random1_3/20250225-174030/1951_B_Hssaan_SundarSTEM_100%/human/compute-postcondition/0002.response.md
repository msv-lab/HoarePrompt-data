Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where `n` is the number of elements in the list `a` and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n. It also accepts a list `a` containing `n` pairwise different integers. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
