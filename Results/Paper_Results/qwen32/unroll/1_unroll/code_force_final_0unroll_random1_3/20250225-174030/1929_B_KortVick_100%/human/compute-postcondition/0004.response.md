Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers, `n` and `k`. It calculates and prints a value indicating the minimum number of colored cells required to ensure that at least `k` diagonals of an `n`-sized square grid contain at least one colored cell. After processing each test case, the function does not retain the values of `n` and `k`.**
