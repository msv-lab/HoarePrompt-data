The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The underscore `_` is a conventional variable name used when the loop variable is not needed, so we don't need to adjust its state.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0**.
