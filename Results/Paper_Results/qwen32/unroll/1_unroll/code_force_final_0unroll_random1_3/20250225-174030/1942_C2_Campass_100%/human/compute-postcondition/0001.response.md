The code snippet provided reads a single integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of `x` distinct integers) are not yet affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change in the state is the assignment of the value of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
