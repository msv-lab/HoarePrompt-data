Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to construct a permutation `p` from an array `a` such that:
- `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`
- `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Given Program:
The program iterates over the array `a` from the end to the beginning, calculating the corresponding value in `p` using the formula `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`, and updates the `mex` value accordingly.

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` with length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The program iterates over the array `ar` from the end to the beginning.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The key idea is to ensure that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `res`.
   - By iterating from the end to the beginning, we are effectively constructing the permutation `p` in reverse order, which allows us to correctly determine the `mex` at each step.
   - The update `mex = mex - ar[i]` is incorrect. The correct update should be to find the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `res` after placing `res[i]`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where `ar[i]` is such that `mex - ar[i]` results in a value that has already been used in `res`.
   - The program assumes that `mex - ar[i]` will always yield a valid and unused integer, which is not guaranteed.

### Detailed Reasoning:
Let's consider the first test case from the example:

```
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

The program will process this as follows:
- Initialize `res` as `[None, None, None, None, None]` and `mex` as `5`.
- Iterate from the end to the beginning:
  - `i = 4`: `ar[4] = 2`, `res[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
  - `i = 3`: `ar[3] = 1`, `res[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
  - `i = 2`: `ar[2] = -2`, `res[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
  - `i = 1`: `ar[1] = 1`, `res[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
  - `i = 0`: `ar[0] = 1`, `res[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`

So, `res` becomes `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which is correct.

However, consider another test case:
```
5
1 1 1 1 1
```

The program will process this as follows:
- Initialize `res` as `[None, None, None, None, None]` and `mex` as `5`.
- Iterate from the end to the beginning:
  - `i = 4`: `ar[4] = 1`, `res[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = min(5, 4) = 4`
  - `i = 3`: `ar[3] = 1`, `res[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = min(4, 3) = 3`
  - `i = 2`: `ar[2] = 1`, `res[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
  - `i = 1`: `ar[1] = 1`, `res[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
  - `i = 0`: `ar[0] = 1`, `res[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`

So, `res` becomes `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is correct.

However, the program's logic of updating `mex` is flawed. It should ensure that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `res` after placing `res[i]`. The current logic does not guarantee this.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases, and the logic for updating `mex` is flawed. The original assessment is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
