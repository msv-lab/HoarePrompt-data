Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The task is to construct a permutation `p` based on the array `a` where each element of `a` is defined as `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`. The MEX (minimum excludant) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

The provided code attempts to solve this problem by iterating over the array `a` in reverse order. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]` and updates the `mex` value if necessary. The `mex` is initialized to `n` (the length of the permutation).

Let's examine the logic:

1. The `mex` variable is initialized to `n`, which is a valid starting point because the MEX of an empty set is `0`, and the MEX of a set containing all numbers from `0` to `n-1` is `n`.

2. The code iterates over the array `a` from the last element to the first. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`. This is based on the definition of `a[i]` given in the problem statement.

3. After calculating `p[i]`, the code checks if the new `mex` value (which is `mex - a[i]`) is less than the current `mex` value. If so, it updates `mex` to the new value. This step ensures that the `mex` variable always holds the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation `p`.

4. The code prints the resulting permutation `p` for each test case.

The logic seems correct based on the problem statement and the provided example. The code correctly calculates the permutation `p` from the array `a` by maintaining the `mex` value and iterating in reverse order.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
