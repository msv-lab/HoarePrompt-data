Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes and prints a list `res` where each element is derived from the difference between a variable `mex` and the corresponding element in `a`. The variable `mex` is adjusted during the computation to ensure the conditions are met.**
