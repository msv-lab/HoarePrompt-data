### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the provided program. The program attempts to construct the permutation \( p \) by iterating backward through the array \( a \) and updating the MEX value incorrectly. Specifically, the program does not correctly maintain the MEX value as the smallest non-negative integer not yet in the permutation \( p \).

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the original assessment is accurate:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `mex` to `n` and iterates backward through the array \( a \). For each element \( a_i \), it calculates \( p_i = \text{mex} - a_i \) and updates `mex` if the new value of `p_i` is smaller.
   - This approach does not ensure that `mex` remains the smallest non-negative integer not in the current prefix of \( p \). Instead, it incorrectly assumes that subtracting \( a_i \) from `mex` will yield the correct next value for \( p \).

2. **Dynamic MEX Calculation**:
   - The corrected version of the program maintains a set `used` to track the numbers already in the permutation \( p \). It dynamically recalculates the MEX value by incrementing it until it finds the smallest non-negative integer not in `used`.
   - This ensures that each \( p_i \) is correctly calculated as \( \text{mex} - a_i \), where `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not yet in \( p \).

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `1 1 -2 1 2`, the corrected program constructs the permutation \( p \) as `0 1 4 2 3`, which is correct.
   - The provided program would likely produce an incorrect permutation because it does not correctly manage the MEX value.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly compute the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \) due to incorrect MEX value management. The corrected version, which dynamically recalculates the MEX value, ensures the correct construction of \( p \).

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
