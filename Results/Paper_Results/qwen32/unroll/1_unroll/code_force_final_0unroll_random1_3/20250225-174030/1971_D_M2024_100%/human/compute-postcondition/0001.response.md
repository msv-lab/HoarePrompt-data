The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Since the state of `t` is already given as an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, it ensures that the loop will execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The variable `_` does not need any specific state before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500**
