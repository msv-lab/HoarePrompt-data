### Reasoning:

The provided Python program consists of multiple functions, but the core functionality lies in `func_14()`, which generates a sequence of integers based on the input values `n` and `k`. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `func_1()` and `func_2()` are utility functions for reading integers and lists of integers from standard input.
   - `func_3()` reads a line of input and splits it into two integers, `n` and `k`.
   - `func_4()` reads multiple test cases by calling `func_3()` for each test case.
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases.

2. **Main Logic in `func_14()`:**
   - Converts `n` and `k` to their binary representations.
   - If `k` is 1:
     - If `n` is 2, it returns `[2]` because the only number less than 2 (other than 1) is 1, which is not allowed.
     - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and adds powers of 2 until it reaches the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - If `k` is not 1:
     - It constructs a sequence starting with the first `lk - 1` powers of 2 (where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`).
     - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence.
     - Finally, it adds the remaining powers of 2 until it reaches the length of the binary representation of `n`.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - `func_15()` reads the number of test cases, processes each test case using `func_14()`, and writes the results to standard output.

### Evaluation:

- **Subsequence Constraints:**
  - The sequence generated by `func_14()` ensures that there is no subsequence that sums to `k`.
  - For all values `v` from 1 to `n` except `k`, there is a subsequence that sums to `v`.

- **Correctness of the Sequence:**
  - The sequence is constructed in such a way that it meets the problem's requirements by carefully choosing the elements to avoid the sum `k` while ensuring all other sums are possible.
  - The use of powers of 2 and additional calculated values ensures that the sequence is of minimal length (at most 25) and meets the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to generate the desired sequence for each test case. The constraints are handled appropriately, and the output format is as required.

**Correctness: True**
