No specific variables are provided in the function signature. The function `func_3` does not have any parameters and seems to be reading input from standard input, which is not directly related to the variables n and k described in the problem statement. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the function is expected to return a list of integers read from the input, which likely corresponds to the values of n and k for a test case. Therefore, the precondition can be described in terms of the expected input format.
