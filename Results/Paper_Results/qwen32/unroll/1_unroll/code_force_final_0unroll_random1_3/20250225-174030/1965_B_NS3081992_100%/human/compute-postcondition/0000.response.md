In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the return value of the function `func_10()`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by this function. Since the function `func_10()` is not defined in the provided context, we can only make assumptions based on its return value.

To ensure the loop executes, the return value of `func_10()` must be greater than or equal to 1. The loop head only involves the underscore `_` (which is a throwaway variable) and the result of `func_10()`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `func_10()` returns a value that allows the loop to execute.

Since the function `func_10()` is not defined, we cannot adjust its internal state directly. However, we can state that for the loop to execute, `func_10()` must return a positive integer.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than or equal to 1**
