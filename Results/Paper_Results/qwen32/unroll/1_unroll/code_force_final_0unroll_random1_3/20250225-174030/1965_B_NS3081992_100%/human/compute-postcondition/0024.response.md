Functionality: **The function `func_14` generates a list of integers based on the values of `n` and `k` obtained from `func_7()`. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list of specific powers of 2 and additional calculated values, then returns the length of this list followed by its elements as a space-separated string.**
