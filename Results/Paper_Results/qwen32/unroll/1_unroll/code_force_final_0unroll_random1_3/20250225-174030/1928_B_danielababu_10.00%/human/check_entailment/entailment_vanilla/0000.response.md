Let's analyze the provided problem and the given code to determine if the code is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal in an array after adding a permutation of numbers from 1 to n to the array. The permutation can be chosen in any order, and each element of the array is increased by the corresponding element of the permutation.

### Key Insight:
To maximize the number of elements that can be made equal, we need to consider how the permutation can be used to align multiple elements to the same value. The optimal strategy is to target the most frequent element in the array and try to make as many other elements equal to it by adding the permutation.

### Steps to Solve:
1. **Count Frequencies**: Count the frequency of each element in the array.
2. **Identify the Most Frequent Element**: Find the element with the highest frequency.
3. **Calculate Potential Matches**: For each unique element, calculate how many other elements can be made equal to it by adding a permutation. This can be done by checking how many elements can be adjusted to match the target element within the range of the permutation (1 to n).
4. **Determine Maximum Matches**: The result is the maximum number of matches possible for any element.

### Given Code Analysis:
The provided code contains several utility functions for input handling and array operations, but it does not contain the main logic to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` to `func_9` are generic and do not directly address the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
Since the provided code does not contain the main logic to solve the problem, it is not correct for the given task. The code only includes utility functions for input and some array manipulations, which are not sufficient to determine the maximum number of elements that can be made equal after adding a permutation.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incomplete and does not solve the problem as described. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
