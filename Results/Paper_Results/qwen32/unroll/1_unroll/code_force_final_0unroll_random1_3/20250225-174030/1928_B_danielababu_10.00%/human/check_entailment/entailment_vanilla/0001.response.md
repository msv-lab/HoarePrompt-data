To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether the given functions can solve the problem described. Let's break down the problem and the provided code:

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal in an array after adding a permutation to it. A permutation is a rearrangement of numbers from 1 to n without repetition. The goal is to maximize the frequency of any single number in the transformed array.

### Key Points:
1. **Input:** Multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers.
2. **Output:** For each test case, the maximum frequency of any number in the array after adding a permutation.
3. **Constraints:** `1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4` test cases, `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` for each test case, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

### Approach:
To solve this problem, we need to consider the following:
- Adding a permutation to the array `a` means each element `a_i` will be transformed to `a_i + p_i` where `p_i` is a unique number between 1 and `n`.
- To maximize the frequency of any number, we need to carefully choose the permutation `p` such that the transformed array has the highest possible count of any single number.

### Observations:
- The optimal strategy is to try to make as many elements as possible equal to the median of the array. This is because the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations, which in turn helps in maximizing the frequency of any number when adding a permutation.
- However, a simpler and more efficient approach is to realize that the maximum frequency we can achieve is `n` if all elements can be made equal by adding a permutation. This is only possible if the range of the array is less than `n` (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array is less than `n`).

### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code includes several functions for input handling, but it does not include the main logic to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` to `func_8` are utility functions for input and processing, but they do not contain the logic to compute the maximum frequency.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incomplete and does not contain the logic to solve the problem. It only includes utility functions for input handling. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not solve the given problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
