Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not contain any logic to solve the problem described. The code consists of several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_9`) that perform various operations such as reading input, converting input to integers, sorting, and computing cumulative products. However, none of these functions address the problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding a permutation.

To solve the problem, the code should:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the length of the array and the array itself.
3. Determine the maximum frequency of any number in the array after adding a permutation. This can be achieved by considering the frequency of each number in the array and how adding a permutation can potentially increase the frequency of any number.

Since the provided code does not implement any logic to achieve the desired result, it is incorrect.
