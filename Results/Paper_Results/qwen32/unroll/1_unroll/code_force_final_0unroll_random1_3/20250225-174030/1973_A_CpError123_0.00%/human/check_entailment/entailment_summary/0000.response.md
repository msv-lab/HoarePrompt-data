Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step against the problem description and the execution summary to determine its correctness.

### Program Analysis

1. **Total Points Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total points across all three players (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - It then checks if `total_points` is even. If not, it returns `-1` because points can only be awarded in even amounts (2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss).

2. **Total Matches Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total number of matches played (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`).

3. **Constraints Check:**
   - It checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3. This is incorrect because there is no inherent limit on the number of matches that can be played among three players. The maximum number of matches is theoretically unbounded, although practically limited by the points.
   - It also checks if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than `total_matchs`. This is also incorrect for the same reason as above. A player can have a score higher than the total number of matches if they won multiple matches.

4. **Draws Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - If the calculated number of draws (`egalites`) is negative, it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `egalites // 2` as the number of draws.

### Issues Identified:

- **Incorrect Constraint on Total Matches:**
  - The program incorrectly limits the number of matches to 3. There is no such constraint in the problem description.
  
- **Incorrect Constraint on Player Scores:**
  - The program incorrectly checks if `p3 > total_matchs`. This check is unnecessary and incorrect.

- **Incorrect Formula for Draws:**
  - The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is incorrect for calculating the maximum number of draws. It does not properly account for the possible distributions of wins and draws among the players.

### Correctness Evaluation:

Given the issues identified in the program, it does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
