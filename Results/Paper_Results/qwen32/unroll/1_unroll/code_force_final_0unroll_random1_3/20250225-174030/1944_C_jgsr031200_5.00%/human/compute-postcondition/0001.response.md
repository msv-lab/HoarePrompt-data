Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < `n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`. `nums` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`. `start` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `start` is set to 0, but the values of `arr`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
