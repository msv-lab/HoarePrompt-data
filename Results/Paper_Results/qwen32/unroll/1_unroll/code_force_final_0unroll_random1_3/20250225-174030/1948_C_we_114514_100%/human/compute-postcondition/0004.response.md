To determine the output state after the loop completes all its iterations, we need to understand the loop's structure and how the variables change within it. 

The loop runs `t` times. In each iteration, the values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are updated from the input, and a function `func_1` is called with these values. The result of `func_1` is then appended to the `results` list.

Since the initial state provides `n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `t`, and the loop modifies `n`, `row1`, and `row2` in each iteration, by the end of the loop, `n`, `row1`, and `row2` will hold the values from the last iteration. The `results` list will contain the results of `func_1` for each of the `t` iterations.

Given the loop structure, the final state of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` will be the values they had in the last iteration of the loop. The `results` list will contain `t` elements, each being the output of `func_1` for the corresponding iteration.

Therefore, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`n` is the integer and `row1` and `row2` are the strings from the last iteration, and `results` is a list of `t` elements, each being the output of `func_1` for each iteration.**
