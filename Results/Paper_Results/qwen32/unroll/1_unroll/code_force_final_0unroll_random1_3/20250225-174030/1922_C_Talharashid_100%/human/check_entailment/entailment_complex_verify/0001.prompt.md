You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

For each query, it calculates and outputs the cumulative distance from a specified city to the closest city that is not the other specified city, based on the given city coordinates.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to see if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem is about finding the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line, where you can either travel directly to another city (paying the distance between them) or travel to the closest city (paying 1 coin). The cost to travel from city `x` to city `y` is the minimum of these two options.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by precomputing the cost to travel from each city to the last city using two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, their coordinates in a list `l`, the number of queries `m`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Precomputing Costs:**
   - `d1` is used to store the cost to travel from each city to the last city moving left to right.
   - `d2` is used to store the cost to travel from each city to the last city moving right to left.
   - The program calculates the cost to travel from each city to the closest city and accumulates this cost to the last city.

3. **Calculating Costs:**
   - For each query, the program determines whether the destination city `y` is greater than the starting city `x`.
   - If `y > x`, it calculates the cost using `d1`.
   - If `y < x`, it calculates the cost using `d2`.

### Issues in the Program:
The provided program has several issues:
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation:** The program incorrectly calculates the cost to travel from one city to another. It assumes that the cost to travel from city `i` to city `j` is simply the difference in precomputed costs to the last city, which is not correct. The cost should be the minimum of the direct distance and the cost of traveling through the closest cities.
- **Initialization and Indexing:** The initialization and indexing in the dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are incorrect. The program starts indexing from 2 and 1 respectively, which is inconsistent with the problem's 1-based indexing.
- **Logic for Closest City:** The logic for determining the closest city is not correctly implemented. The program does not correctly compute the closest city for each city.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The cost calculation and logic for determining the closest city are flawed.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
