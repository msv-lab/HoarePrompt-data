The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable used in `range(int(input()))`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The value of `t` (which is the number of test cases) directly influences this, as `int(input())` will be equal to `t`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, `y_i`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0**
