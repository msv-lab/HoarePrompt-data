In the provided task, the for loop iterates over the number of test cases, which is determined by the input. The loop head only contains the variable `_` which is a common placeholder for a variable that we do not intend to use. Since the loop iterates based on the integer input, the only state we need to ensure is that the input is a valid integer within the specified range.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop variable**: The loop variable is `_`, which is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.
2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop runs for `int(input())` times. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `input()` provides an integer value within the range [2, 10^4].

Given this understanding, the state before the loop starts should ensure that the input is a valid integer within the specified range. Since the loop variable `_` does not need adjustment, we only need to ensure the input is correct.

State: **The input must be an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4**.
