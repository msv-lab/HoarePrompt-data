Precondition: **There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can interactively query up to 3n times per test case to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in the permutation. The goal is to find any two indices i and j such that the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized.**
