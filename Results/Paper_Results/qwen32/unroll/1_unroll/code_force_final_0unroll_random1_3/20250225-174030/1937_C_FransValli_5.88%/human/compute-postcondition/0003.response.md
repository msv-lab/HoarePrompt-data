Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. For each test case, it interactively queries up to 3n times to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in the permutation. The goal is to identify two indices such that the bitwise XOR of the corresponding elements in the permutation is maximized. After processing all test cases, the function outputs these two indices for each test case.**
