No variables in the provided function signature. The function `func_3` is not directly related to the problem's main logic based on the given code snippet. However, based on the context, it seems to read two integers from the standard input, which could be `n` and `m` for each test case. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the function returns a list containing two integers, `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6.
