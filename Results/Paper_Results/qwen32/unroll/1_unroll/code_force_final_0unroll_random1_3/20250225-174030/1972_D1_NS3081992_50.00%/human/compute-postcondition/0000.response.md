The code snippet `n, m = func_7()` indicates that the function `func_7()` is called, and its return values are assigned to the variables `n` and `m`. Since the specific behavior of `func_7()` is not provided, we can only assume that it returns two values which are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` were positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. After the function call, `n` and `m` will take on the values returned by `func_7()`, and we do not have information about those specific values.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`**.
