Let's analyze the given program and the problem description carefully.

The problem description states that Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize the number of times Bob wins. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is 0. The program aims to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

Let's break down the program:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads four integers (the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s).
3. It modifies the counts by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2 (`p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`), effectively making all counts even.
4. It then checks if the sum of the first three counts modulo 2 is 3 (which is always false since the sum modulo 2 can only be 0, 1, or 2).
5. Finally, it prints the result of the above check plus half the sum of the modified counts.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Modification of Counts**: The program modifies the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s by making them even. This step is not explained in the problem description and seems arbitrary.
2. **Checking the Sum of First Three Counts**: The condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if the sum of the first three counts modulo 2 is 3, which is logically impossible. This part of the code does not make sense and seems to be incorrect.
3. **Calculating the Result**: The result is calculated as the sum of the above check (which is always 0) plus half the sum of the modified counts. This does not align with the problem's goal of determining the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Correctness Check

Let's consider a few test cases to see if the program works as expected:

1. **Test Case 1**: Input `1 1 1 0`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program's logic does not seem to handle this correctly.

2. **Test Case 2**: Input `1 0 1 2`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program's logic does not seem to handle this correctly.

3. **Test Case 3**: Input `2 2 2 0`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - The program's logic does not seem to handle this correctly.

4. **Test Case 4**: Input `3 3 2 0`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - The program's logic does not seem to handle this correctly.

5. **Test Case 5**: Input `0 9 9 9`
   - Expected Output: `12`
   - The program's logic does not seem to handle this correctly.

### Conclusion

The program does not follow the problem description and does not handle the test cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**.
