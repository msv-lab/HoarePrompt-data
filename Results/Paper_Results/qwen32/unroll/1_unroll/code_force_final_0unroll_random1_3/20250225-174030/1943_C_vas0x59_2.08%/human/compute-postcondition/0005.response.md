To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `func_1` and how it processes the input `d`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we can only assume that it performs some operation on the list `d` and returns a value or a modified version of `d`.

Given the lack of details about `func_1`, we will assume that `func_1(d)` could return a value or modify `d` in some way. However, since we do not have the definition of `func_1`, we can only state that a new variable `a` is assigned the result of `func_1(d)`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the nodes that are directly connected to the node corresponding to the index of the inner list; `d` is a list of distances from node `0` to all other nodes; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.
