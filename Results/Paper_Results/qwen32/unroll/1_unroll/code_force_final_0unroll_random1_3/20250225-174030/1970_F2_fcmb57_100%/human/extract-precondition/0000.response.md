Precondition: **a is an integer representing the number of rows in the field (3 ≤ a ≤ 99 and a is odd), b is an integer representing the number of columns in the field (3 ≤ b ≤ 99 and b is odd). The field is a 2D grid of size a x b where each cell contains a string that can be ".." (empty cell), "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9" (players), "RG", "BG" (goals), ".Q" (Quaffle), or ".B" (Bludger). There is exactly one Quaffle and at least one goal for each team. The number of players for each team is between 1 and 10. After the field description, there is an integer T (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000) representing the number of steps in the game, followed by T lines each describing an action performed by an entity on the field. Each action line starts with a pair of characters representing the entity (player or ball) and is followed by a character (U, D, L, R for movement, C for catching a ball, T for throwing the Quaffle).**
