Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
- Stepan needs to send `n` messages at specific moments `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`.
- The phone starts with `f` units of charge.
- The phone loses `a` units of charge per unit of time.
- Turning the phone off and on consumes `b` units of charge.
- The phone cannot send a message if its charge drops to 0 or below.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It then reads the list of moments `arr` at which messages need to be sent.

2. **Processing Logic:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `array2`.
   - For each message:
     - If it's the first message (`i == 0`):
       - It checks if the time to send the first message is less than `b / a`. If true, it appends the charge used to send the message (`arr[0] * a`) to `array2`.
     - For subsequent messages:
       - It checks if the time difference between the current and previous message is less than `b / a`. If true, it appends the charge used to send the message (`(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`) to `array2`.
   - It calculates the total charge used as the sum of charges in `array2` plus the charge used for turning the phone on and off (`(n - len(array2)) * b`).
   - If the total charge used is less than `f`, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Condition for Turning Off and On:** The condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is incorrect. The phone should only be turned off and on if sending the message without turning off and on would deplete the charge.
- **No Handling for Initial Charge:** The program does not account for the initial charge `f` correctly. It should check if the charge after each message (considering the time elapsed and the option to turn off and on) is sufficient.
- **No Proper Calculation of Charge Usage:** The program incorrectly sums up the charges and does not account for the possibility of turning the phone off and on at optimal times to conserve charge.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
