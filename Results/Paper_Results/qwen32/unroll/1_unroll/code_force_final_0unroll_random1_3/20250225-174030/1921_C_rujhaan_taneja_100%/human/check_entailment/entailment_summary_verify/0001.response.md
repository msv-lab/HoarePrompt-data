### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the given program based on the problem description, the code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Understanding:
- **Objective:** Determine if Stepan can send all messages without the phone's charge dropping to 0 or below.
- **Constraints:** 
  - The phone loses `a` units of charge per unit of time.
  - Turning the phone off and on consumes `b` units of charge.
  - The initial charge is `f`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It then reads the list of moments `arr` at which messages need to be sent.

2. **Processing Logic:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `array2`.
   - For each message:
     - If it's the first message (`i == 0`):
       - It checks if the time to send the first message is less than `b / a`. If true, it appends the charge used to send the message (`arr[0] * a`) to `array2`.
     - For subsequent messages:
       - It checks if the time difference between the current and previous message is less than `b / a`. If true, it appends the charge used to send the message (`(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`) to `array2`.
   - It calculates the total charge used as the sum of charges in `array2` plus the charge used for turning the phone on and off (`(n - len(array2)) * b`).
   - If the total charge used is less than `f`, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Condition for Turning Off and On:**
   - The condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is incorrect. This condition does not accurately determine if turning the phone off and on is necessary to avoid depleting the charge.
   - The program should check if the charge after waiting until the next message (considering the time elapsed and the option to turn off and on) is sufficient. If not, it should consider turning the phone off and on.

2. **No Proper Calculation of Charge Usage:**
   - The program incorrectly sums up the charges and does not account for the possibility of turning the phone off and on at optimal times to conserve charge.
   - The program does not correctly handle the initial charge `f` and the charge consumption over time.

3. **No Handling for Initial Charge:**
   - The program does not account for the initial charge `f` correctly. It should check if the charge after each message (considering the time elapsed and the option to turn off and on) is sufficient.

#### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: False**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect.
