You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

    #State: A series of "Yes" or "No" outputs, one for each test case, based on the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and a list `m` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes a value based on the differences between consecutive elements in `m` and compares it to `f`. If the computed value is less than `f`, it outputs "Yes"; otherwise, it outputs "No".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for all potential cases. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Handling of Initial Charge and Charge Consumption**:
   - The program calculates the charge consumption only for the intervals between message times when the phone is on. However, it does not account for the initial charge correctly.
   - The program checks if the sum of the charge consumption during the intervals plus the energy consumed for turning the phone on and off is less than the initial charge. This logic is incorrect because the phone can start with an initial charge and then turn off and on multiple times, which the current logic does not handle correctly.

2. **Charge Consumption Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the charge consumption for intervals where the phone remains on. However, it does not handle the case where the phone needs to be turned off and on to conserve charge.
   - Specifically, the program checks if the interval between messages is less than `b/a`. If it is, it calculates the charge consumption for that interval. However, if the interval is greater than `b/a`, the phone should be turned off and on, which the program does not account for.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the phone needs to be turned off and on multiple times to send all messages.
   - For example, consider a test case where the initial charge is low, and the intervals between messages are large. The phone might need to be turned off and on multiple times to conserve charge, but the program does not handle this correctly.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Let's consider a test case:
```
1
5 10 1 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
- The phone starts with 10 units of charge.
- The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time.
- The phone consumes 2 units of charge when turned off and on.
- The messages need to be sent at times 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

The program will calculate the charge consumption for the intervals between messages:
- From 0 to 1: 1 unit of charge consumed.
- From 1 to 2: 1 unit of charge consumed.
- From 2 to 3: 1 unit of charge consumed.
- From 3 to 4: 1 unit of charge consumed.
- From 4 to 5: 1 unit of charge consumed.

Total charge consumed: 5 units.
Total energy consumed for turning on and off: 4 * 2 = 8 units (since the phone needs to be turned off and on 4 times).

Total energy required: 5 + 8 = 13 units, which is more than the initial charge of 10 units. Therefore, the correct answer should be "NO", but the program might output "YES" due to incorrect logic.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach would involve simulating the process of sending messages, turning the phone off and on as needed, and checking if the charge remains sufficient at all times. The program should handle the intervals between messages and the energy consumed for turning the phone on and off correctly.

Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect.
