To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's break down the code and understand what it does:

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, the code reads two lines of input. The first line contains integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. The second line contains a list of `n` integers `m`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It initializes an empty list `array2`.
   - It iterates through the list `arr` (which is the same as `m`).
   - For the first element, if `arr[0] < b / a`, it appends `arr[0] * a` to `array2`.
   - For subsequent elements, if the difference between the current and previous element is less than `b / a`, it appends the difference multiplied by `a` to `array2`.
   - After processing the list, it calculates the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b`.
   - If this sum is less than `f`, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

3. **Output**: The output for each test case is either "Yes" or "No" based on the condition mentioned above.

Given the loop iterates over all test cases, the final state after all iterations will be a series of "Yes" or "No" outputs, one for each test case.

Since the question asks for the output state in a specific format, and considering that the output is a series of print statements rather than a final variable state, we can describe the output state as a sequence of "Yes" or "No" results corresponding to each test case.

Output State: **A series of "Yes" or "No" outputs, one for each test case, based on the given conditions.**
