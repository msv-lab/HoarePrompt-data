a and b are lists of integers. a contains the indices of the prefix maximums, and b contains the indices of the suffix maximums for a permutation of length n. The length of a is m_1, the length of b is m_2, and both m_1 and m_2 are between 1 and n (inclusive). The elements of a and b are in strictly increasing order, and each element is between 1 and n (inclusive). The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
