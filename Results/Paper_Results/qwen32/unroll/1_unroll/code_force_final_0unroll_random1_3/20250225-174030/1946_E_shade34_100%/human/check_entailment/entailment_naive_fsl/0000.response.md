Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not actually solve the problem described. The problem requires calculating the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximums. The given code includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which appear to be related to modular arithmetic (specifically, calculating modular inverses), but they do not address the core problem of counting permutations.

The provided code does not handle the logic for counting permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. It does not iterate over possible permutations, check the conditions for prefix and suffix maximums, or count valid permutations. Therefore, it is incorrect for the given problem description.

If the code were to be correct, it would need to implement an algorithm that:
1. Generates or counts permutations of length `n`.
2. Checks if a permutation meets the criteria for having the specified prefix and suffix maximums.
3. Counts and returns the number of valid permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Since the provided code does not perform these steps, it is incorrect.
