### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of permutations of a certain length that satisfy specific prefix and suffix maximum conditions. Here's the breakdown of the logic and the correctness of the program:

1. **Factorial Precomputation:**
   - The program precomputes factorials up to `200001` modulo `10^9 + 7` and stores them in the `facts` list. This is done to efficiently compute combinations later.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation (`n`), the number of prefix maximums (`m1`), the number of suffix maximums (`m2`), the indices of the prefix maximums (`p`), and the indices of the suffix maximums (`s`).

3. **Validation:**
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index is equal to the first suffix maximum index, the first prefix maximum index is `1`, and the last suffix maximum index is `n`. If any of these conditions are not met, the program outputs `0` because such permutations are impossible.

4. **Combination Calculation:**
   - If the conditions are met, the program calculates the number of valid permutations using combinations.
   - It iterates through the suffix maximum indices and calculates combinations using the precomputed factorials. The function `func_2` is used to compute the modular inverse and multiply it with the factorial values to get the combinations.
   - It then does the same for the prefix maximum indices, excluding the last one (since it's already considered in the suffix part).

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The program multiplies the number of ways to arrange the elements between consecutive prefix maximums and consecutive suffix maximums.
   - It also multiplies by the factorial of the gaps between the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The final result is taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of permutations that satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximum conditions. It uses efficient precomputation of factorials and combination calculations to handle large inputs within the given constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
