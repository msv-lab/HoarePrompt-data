To determine the output state, we need to consider the function `func_1(b, a)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we can't determine the exact values of `c` and `d` that will be returned. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the function's return values.

Given:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
- `b` is not equal to 0.
- `a` is less than `b`.

The code snippet `c, d = func_1(b, a)` indicates that `func_1` is called with `b` and `a` as arguments, and the function returns two values which are assigned to `c` and `d`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we can't provide specific values for `c` and `d`, but we can state that they are the results of `func_1(b, a)`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers, `b` is not equal to 0, `a` is less than `b`, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`**.
