### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not address the core problem of counting permutations with specific prefix and suffix maximums. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are indeed related to modular arithmetic, specifically the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and modular multiplicative inverse, but they do not provide a solution to the problem at hand.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. **Understand the Constraints and Conditions**: We need to ensure that the permutation satisfies the given prefix and suffix maximum conditions.
2. **Count Valid Permutations**: Use combinatorial methods to count the number of permutations that meet these conditions.
3. **Modulo Operation**: Ensure that the result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The provided code does not include any logic to address these points. Instead, it focuses on modular arithmetic functions that are not directly related to the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in stating that the provided code is not correct for solving the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
