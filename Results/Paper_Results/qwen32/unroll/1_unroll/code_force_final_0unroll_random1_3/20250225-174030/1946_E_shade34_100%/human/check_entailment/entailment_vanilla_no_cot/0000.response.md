Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully solve the problem described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be related to modular arithmetic, specifically for calculating modular inverses, but they do not address the logic required to count the number of permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums.

To solve this problem, you would need to:
1. Parse the input for each test case.
2. Determine the constraints imposed by the prefix and suffix maximums.
3. Calculate the number of valid permutations that satisfy these constraints.
4. Output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The provided code does not include any logic to handle the prefix and suffix maximums or to count permutations accordingly. Therefore, it is incorrect for the given problem.
