The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `a` and `b`. It returns a tuple of two integers based on the relationship between `a` and `b`. Specifically, it calculates and returns the coefficients (x, y) such that `a*x + b*y = gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
