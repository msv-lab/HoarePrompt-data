### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **incorrect**. Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this beauty, we need to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The optimal way to achieve this is to sort the array and then compute the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code sorts the array and then prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. This is not the correct approach to maximize the beauty as described. Instead, it should compute the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

#### Correct Approach:
1. Sort the array.
2. Compute the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Let's illustrate this with the example given in the problem description:

**Example:**
```
5
3
2 1 3
```
- After sorting, the array becomes \([1, 2, 3]\).
- The beauty is calculated as \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2\).

The provided code, however, computes \(3 - 1 = 2\), which is indeed the correct answer for this specific example. But this is a coincidence and not the correct general approach.

#### Correct Implementation:
Here is the correct implementation based on the described approach:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            beauty += a[i] - a[i-1]
        print(beauty)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **incorrect** because it challenges the program based on an incorrect understanding of the program's behavior. The provided code, although it happens to give the correct answer for the given example, does not correctly implement the algorithm to maximize the beauty of the array in all cases. The correct approach is to sum the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

**Final: False**

The original assessment should be overturned because the program, while coincidentally correct for the given example, does not implement the correct algorithm to solve the problem in all cases.
