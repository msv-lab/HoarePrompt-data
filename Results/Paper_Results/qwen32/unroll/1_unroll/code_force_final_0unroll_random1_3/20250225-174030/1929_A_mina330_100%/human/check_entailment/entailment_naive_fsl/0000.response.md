Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be arranged in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then alternating the largest and smallest remaining elements.

The given program sorts the array and then simply prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which does not maximize the beauty as described.

For example, consider the test case:
```
5
3
2 1 3
```
The correct rearrangement to maximize beauty would be [1, 3, 2] or [3, 1, 2], both yielding a beauty of 2. However, the provided program would output 2 - 1 = 1, which is incorrect.

A correct approach would be to sort the array and then calculate the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, or by alternating the largest and smallest elements to maximize the differences.
