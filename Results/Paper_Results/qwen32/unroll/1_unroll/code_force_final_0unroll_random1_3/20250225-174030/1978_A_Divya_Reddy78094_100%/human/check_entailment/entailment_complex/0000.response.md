Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal of the program is to divide the books into two non-empty piles and maximize the sum of the highest number of pages in each pile. However, the current implementation simply takes the maximum value from all but the last book and adds it to the last book, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of the highest values in two separate piles.

For example, consider the second test case:
```
4
2 3 3 1
```
The program will output `4` (max(2, 3, 3) + 1), but the optimal division is to put the books with 3 and 3 pages in one pile and the books with 2 and 1 pages in the other pile, resulting in a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pages read.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible ways to divide the books into two non-empty piles and find the division that maximizes the sum of the highest number of pages in each pile. The current implementation does not do this.

Correctness: **False**
