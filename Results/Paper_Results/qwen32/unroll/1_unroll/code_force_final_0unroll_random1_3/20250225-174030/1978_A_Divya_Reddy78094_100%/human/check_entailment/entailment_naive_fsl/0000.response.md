Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. The current implementation always adds the last book to one pile and the maximum of the remaining books to the other pile. This does not guarantee that Alice will read the maximum total number of pages by dividing the books into two piles.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
3
3
1 2 3
```
The program will output `4` (since it adds `3` from the last book and `1` from the remaining books), but the correct answer should be `5` (by dividing the books into piles `[1, 2]` and `[3]`, Alice can read `2` from the first pile and `3` from the second pile).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible ways to divide the books into two non-empty piles and calculate the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by selecting the highest number in each pile. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        max_pages = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            max_pages = max(max_pages, nums[0] + nums[i])
        print(max_pages)

func()
```

This version sorts the books in descending order and then tries dividing the books into two piles by considering the highest book and the next highest book in each possible division.
