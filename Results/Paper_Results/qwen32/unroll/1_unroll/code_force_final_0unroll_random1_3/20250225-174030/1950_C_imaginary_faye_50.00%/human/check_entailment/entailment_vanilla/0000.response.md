Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly converts time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the time string `s` of format `hh:mm`.

2. **Extracting Hours:**
   - The first two characters of `s` (i.e., `s[:2]`) are extracted as `h`, representing the hour in 24-hour format.

3. **Converting Hours to 12-hour Format:**
   - If `h` is `'00'`, it prints `'12'` (midnight in 12-hour format).
   - If `h` is less than or equal to `'12'`, it prints `h` as it is (since it's already in the correct range for AM).
   - If `h` is greater than `'12'`, it calculates the equivalent hour in 12-hour format by subtracting `12` from `int(h)`. However, it incorrectly formats the result by prefixing with `'0'` if the result is a single digit, which is not necessary and might lead to incorrect formatting (e.g., `09` should be `09`, but `01` should not be `01` but `1`).

4. **Printing Minutes and Period:**
   - The program prints the minutes part `s[2:]` directly.
   - It then selects the period (`AM` or `PM`) based on whether `h` is greater than or equal to `12`.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Formatting of Single-digit Hours:**
  - The program incorrectly prefixes single-digit hours with `'0'` after conversion, which is not needed.
  - For example, `13:00` should be converted to `01:00 PM`, but the program might output `01:00 PM` incorrectly due to the prefixing issue.

### Correctness:
Given the identified issue with the formatting of single-digit hours, the program is not entirely correct.

**Correctness: False**

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, we should ensure that single-digit hours are not prefixed with `'0'` unless necessary. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = int(s[:2])
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            period = 'AM'
        elif h < 12:
            period = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            period = 'PM'
        else:
            h -= 12
            period = 'PM'
        print(f"{h:02}:{s[3:]} {period}")

func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the hour is correctly formatted and handles the transition between AM and PM correctly.
