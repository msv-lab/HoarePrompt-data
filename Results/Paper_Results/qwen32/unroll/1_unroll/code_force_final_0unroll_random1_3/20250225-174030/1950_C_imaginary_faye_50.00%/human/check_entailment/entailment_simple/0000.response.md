### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. Let's break down the logic and compare it with the requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` which represents the time in 24-hour format.

2. **Extracting Hours and Minutes:**
   - The program extracts the hour part `h` from the string `s` using `s[:2]`.
   - The minutes part `s[2:]` remains unchanged.

3. **Converting Hours:**
   - If the hour `h` is `'00'`, it prints `'12'` (midnight in 12-hour format).
   - If the hour `h` is less than or equal to `'12'`, it prints the hour as is.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than `'12'`, it subtracts 12 from the hour and prints the result. However, it incorrectly uses `'0{}'.format(int(h) - 12)` which will not always produce a two-digit hour format (e.g., `'09'` becomes `'09'` but `'13'` becomes `'01'`).

4. **Determining AM/PM:**
   - The program uses a list `['AM', 'PM']` and indexes into it based on whether the hour `h` is greater than or equal to 12.
   - This logic correctly identifies whether the time is in the AM or PM period.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the converted hour, the minutes, and the AM/PM period.

### Issues:

- **Incorrect Conversion for Hours Greater Than 12:**
  - When converting hours greater than 12, the program should ensure the hour is always two digits. For example, `'13'` should convert to `'01'`, but the current implementation uses `'0{}'.format(int(h) - 12)`, which will not work correctly for all cases.

### Corrected Code:

To fix the issue, the conversion for hours greater than 12 should ensure two digits:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        h = int(s[:2])
        m = s[2:]
        
        if h == 0:
            h12 = 12
        elif h > 12:
            h12 = h - 12
        else:
            h12 = h
        
        print(f"{h12:02}:{m} {'PM' if h >= 12 else 'AM'}")

#State: For each of the t test cases, the output will be a string in the format "hh:mm [AM/PM]", where "hh" is the hour converted to a 12-hour format, "mm" remains the same, and "[AM/PM]" indicates whether the time is in the AM or PM period.
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect due to the issue with converting hours greater than 12 to ensure a two-digit format. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
