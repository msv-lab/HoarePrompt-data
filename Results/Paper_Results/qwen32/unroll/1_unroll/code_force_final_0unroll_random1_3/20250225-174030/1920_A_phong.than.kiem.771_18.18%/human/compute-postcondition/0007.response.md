Output State: **The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is derived from converting each substring in `items` to an integer. If `space` is True, `items` is a list of substrings from `line` split by whitespace. Otherwise, `items` is a list of characters from `line`. Since `to_int` is True, each element in `items` is converted to an integer.**

To simplify:
- If `space` is True, the input string `line` is split by whitespace, and each resulting substring is converted to an integer.
- If `space` is False, each character in the input string `line` is converted to an integer.

For example:
- If `line` is "123 456" and `space` is True, the output is `[123, 456]`.
- If `line` is "123" and `space` is False, the output is `[1, 2, 3]`.
