To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the loop condition `index != -1`. The loop will execute if `index` is not equal to `-1`.

Given the state:
- `string` is a string value
- `substring` is a string value
- `indices` is an empty list
- `index` is the lowest index where `substring` is found in `string` or `-1` if `substring` is not found in `string`

For the loop to execute, `index` must be a value other than `-1`. This means `substring` must be found within `string`.

### Steps to Adjust the State:
1. **Ensure `substring` is present in `string`:** The `index` variable is determined by the presence of `substring` in `string`. If `substring` is not found, `index` will be `-1`. To ensure the loop executes, `substring` must be a substring of `string`.

### Adjusted State:
- `string` must contain `substring` so that `index` is not `-1`.

### Final State:
State: **`string` must contain `substring`, `substring` is a string value, `indices` is an empty list, `index` is the lowest index where `substring` is found in `string`**

This ensures that the loop condition `index != -1` is satisfied, allowing the loop to execute at least once.
