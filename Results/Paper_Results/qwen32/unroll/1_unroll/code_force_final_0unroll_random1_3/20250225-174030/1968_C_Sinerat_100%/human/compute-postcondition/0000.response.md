In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `_` and the range is determined by `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by the input, which represents the number of test cases `t`. 

The state before the loop starts includes:
- `t` (the number of test cases)
- `n` (the number of elements in the array for each test case)
- `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` (the elements of the array for each test case)

However, according to the task, we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `_` and the range `int(input())`. Since the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`, the only thing we can adjust is the input value that will be read by `int(input())`.

To ensure the loop executes, the input value (which represents `t`) must be at least 1. The values of `n` and the elements of the array `x` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted according to the task's constraints.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should ensure that the input value for `t` is at least 1.

State: **The input value for `t` must be at least 1**.
