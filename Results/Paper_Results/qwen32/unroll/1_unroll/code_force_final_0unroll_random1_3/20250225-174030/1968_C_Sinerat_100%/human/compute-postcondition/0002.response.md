Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of elements in an array `a`, and the next line contains `n-1` integers `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` representing the elements of the array `x`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case based on the provided elements.**
