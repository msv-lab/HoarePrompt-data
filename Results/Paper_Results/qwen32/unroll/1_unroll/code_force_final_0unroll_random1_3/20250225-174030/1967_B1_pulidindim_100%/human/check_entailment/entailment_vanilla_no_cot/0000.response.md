Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The logic and the approach in the program seem to be incorrect for the problem statement. The program does not properly account for the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. It also incorrectly initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`, which doesn't align with the problem's requirements.

Here's a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:
- The program starts `count` from 2 and `ans` from `n`, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
- The logic for updating `ans` and the loop condition do not correctly implement the problem's requirements.
- There is no explicit calculation or check for the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

A correct solution would involve iterating over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checking the condition for each pair, or using a more efficient mathematical approach to count the valid pairs.
