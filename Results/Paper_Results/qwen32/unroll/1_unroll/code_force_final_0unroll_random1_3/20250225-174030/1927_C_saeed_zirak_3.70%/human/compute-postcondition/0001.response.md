To determine the output state after the execution of the given loop, we need to understand what the loop does for each test case and how the variables change.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the loop's execution for each test case:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are read from the input.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input.
   - `aOnes` and `bOnes` are initialized to 0.
   - `newk` is calculated as `k // 2`.
   - `i` is initialized to 1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs while `i` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - For each `i`:
     - If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, it increments either `aOnes` or `bOnes` based on which is smaller.
     - If `i` is only in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, it increments `aOnes`.
     - If `i` is only in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, it increments `bOnes`.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, the loop breaks.
     - `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Decision**:
   - After the loop, if `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, it prints 'yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

The output state is determined by whether the final values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`.

**Output State:**
The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, based on whether `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`.

Output State: **a series of 'yes' or 'no' for each test case.**
