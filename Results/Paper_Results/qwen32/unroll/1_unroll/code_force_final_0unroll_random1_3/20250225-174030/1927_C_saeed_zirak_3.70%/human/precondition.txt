t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m). a is a list of n integers, and b is a list of m integers, where each element in a and b is an integer between 1 and 10^6, inclusive. The sum of all n and m across all test cases does not exceed 4·10^5.
