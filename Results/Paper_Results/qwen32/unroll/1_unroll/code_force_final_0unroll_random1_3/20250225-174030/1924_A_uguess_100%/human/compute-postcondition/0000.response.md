Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000. `s` is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer input by the user. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`) retain their initial described states and constraints.
