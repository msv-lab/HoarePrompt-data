You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        cnt = 0
        cur = 0
        ans = ''
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
                ans += ss
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                    break
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if there are at least `n` distinct substrings of `s` that contain all `k` unique characters. If so, it outputs 'YES'. Otherwise, it outputs 'NO' and constructs a string that includes the missing characters and additional 'a's to meet the requirement of `n` substrings.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze why:

1. **Logic Error in Counting Subsequences:**
   - The program seems to be trying to count the number of distinct subsequences of length `k` in the string `s` that contain all `k` characters. However, it does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
   - The variable `cur` is used to track which characters have been seen in the current subsequence, but the logic to reset `cur` and count subsequences is flawed.

2. **Generating Missing Subsequence:**
   - If the program determines that not all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`, it attempts to generate a missing subsequence. However, the logic to generate this subsequence is incorrect. It only checks for characters that were not seen in the last incomplete subsequence, which does not guarantee that the generated subsequence is not present in `s`.

3. **Example Case:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     2 2 4
     abba
     ```
     The program should output `YES` because all possible strings of length 2 using `a` and `b` (`aa`, `ab`, `ba`, `bb`) are subsequences of `abba`.
     - The program might incorrectly determine that not all subsequences are present and output `NO` followed by an incorrect subsequence.

4. **Flawed Subsequence Generation:**
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     2 2 3
     abb
     ```
     The program should output `NO` followed by a missing subsequence, such as `aa`. However, the program might output an incorrect subsequence like `ab` or `ba`, which are actually present in `abb`.

### Correct Approach:
- The program should generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each one is a subsequence of `s`.
- If a string is not found as a subsequence, it should be printed as the missing subsequence.

Given the above points, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description and fails for certain edge cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
