Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if there are at least `n` distinct substrings of `s` that contain all `k` unique characters. If so, it outputs 'YES'. Otherwise, it outputs 'NO' and constructs a string that includes the missing characters and additional 'a's to meet the requirement of `n` substrings.**
