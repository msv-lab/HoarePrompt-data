### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to determine whether a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles such that these two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. The logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly implement the required conditions.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Logic for Even Sides**:
   - The program correctly identifies that if both `a` and `b` are even, the answer is 'yes'. This is because an even-sided rectangle can always be cut into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
   
2. **Logic for Odd Sides**:
   - The program has incorrect logic for handling cases where `a` and `b` are not both even. Specifically, the conditions `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are incorrect and do not serve any meaningful purpose. These conditions will always evaluate to `False` because they are comparing a tuple to a boolean value.
   - The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is also incorrect. This condition is essentially checking if `a` and `b` are not equal, but it is not the correct way to determine if a new rectangle can be formed. Instead, it should check if at least one of `a` or `b` is even, which would allow for a cut that results in rearrangeable smaller rectangles.
   - The `else` statement, which prints 'no', is not correctly handling all cases where `a` and `b` are not both even.

### Correct Logic:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, then it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. This is because an even side can be divided into two equal parts.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, then it is not possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle, as all resulting smaller rectangles will be odd-sided and cannot be rearranged into a different rectangle.

### Correct Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
