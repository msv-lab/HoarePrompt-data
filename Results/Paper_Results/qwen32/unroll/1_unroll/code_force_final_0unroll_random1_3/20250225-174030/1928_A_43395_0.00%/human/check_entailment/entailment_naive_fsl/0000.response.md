Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.
3. It then checks the following conditions:
   - If both `a` and `b` are even, it prints "yes".
   - If `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)`, it prints "no".
   - If `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`, it prints "yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "no".

There are several issues with this logic:
1. The condition `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is not meaningful. It seems like there's a logical error in this part of the code.
2. The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always true for any non-zero `a - b`. This condition does not correctly determine whether a new rectangle can be formed.
3. The program does not handle all cases correctly. For example, if `a` is even and `b` is odd (or vice versa), the program might not give the correct answer.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider a counterexample to show that the program is incorrect.

**Input:**
```
2
2 3
3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Yes
Yes
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will print "no" for both cases because it does not handle the cases where one dimension is even and the other is odd correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to check if we can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then form a new rectangle from those two smaller rectangles. This is possible if either `a` or `b` is even. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then it's not possible to form a new rectangle.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version checks if either `a` or `b` is even, which is the correct condition for forming a new rectangle.
