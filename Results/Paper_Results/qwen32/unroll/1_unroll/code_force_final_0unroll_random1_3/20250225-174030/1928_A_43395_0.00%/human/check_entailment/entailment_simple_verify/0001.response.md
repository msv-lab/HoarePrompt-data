### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the program based on the problem description and the annotated code to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis Recap:
Bob can form a new rectangle if:
- He can cut the original rectangle into two distinct rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
- These two resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

Key Observations:
- If either dimension of the original rectangle is 1, then it cannot be cut into two distinct rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- If both dimensions are even, then the rectangle can always be cut into two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- If one dimension is even and the other is odd, then the rectangle can also be cut into two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- If both dimensions are odd, then the rectangle can only be cut into two rectangles of size 1x(odd), which cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

#### Program Analysis:
Let's go through the provided program and its annotations:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.

2. **Logic to Determine if a New Rectangle Can Be Formed:**
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If they are, it prints "yes".
     ```python
     if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
         print('yes')
     ```
     This part is correct for the case where both dimensions are even.

   - It then checks an incorrect and nonsensical condition:
     ```python
     elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
         print('no')
     ```
     This condition is comparing a tuple to a boolean value, which is incorrect and doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.

   - It then checks another incorrect condition:
     ```python
     elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
         print('yes')
     ```
     This condition is always true if `a` and `b` are not equal, which is not the correct logic for determining if a new rectangle can be formed.

   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "no":
     ```python
     else:
         print('no')
     ```

#### Issues in the Program:
- The condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` is incorrect and doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
- The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always true if `a` and `b` are not equal, which is not the correct logic for determining if a new rectangle can be formed.
- The program doesn't correctly handle the case where both dimensions are odd.

#### Correct Logic:
- If either `a` or `b` is 1, print "no".
- If both `a` and `b` are not 1, print "yes".

#### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a == 1 or b == 1:
            print('no')
        else:
            print('yes')
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the given program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.

**Final: False**
