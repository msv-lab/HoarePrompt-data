For the given task, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the state of the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(t)`, which means the loop will execute `t` times. The only variable we can adjust is `t`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(t)`. The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will execute.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute `t` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - The state `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be set to a value greater than 0.

### Final State:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0**
