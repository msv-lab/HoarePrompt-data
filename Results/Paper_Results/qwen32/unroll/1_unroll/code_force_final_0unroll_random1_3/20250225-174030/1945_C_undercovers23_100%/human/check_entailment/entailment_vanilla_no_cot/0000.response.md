Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed to ensure it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `pk`**: The variable `pk` is calculated as `n / 2` for both even and odd `n`. However, for odd `n`, `pk` should be calculated as `(n + 1) / 2` to correctly represent the middle position.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Percentages**: The program calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` as percentages, but the problem requires checking if the counts meet the condition of at least half of the residents being satisfied, not percentages. The correct conditions should be `zero >= (i + 1) / 2` and `one >= (n - i - 1) / 2`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle cases where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house. Specifically, it should check if placing the road at position `0` or `n` satisfies the conditions.

4. **Handling Multiple Suitable Positions**: The program correctly identifies multiple suitable positions and selects the one closest to the middle, but it can be simplified and optimized.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        sl = list(s)
        o = sl.count('1')
        z = sl.count('0')
        (zero, one) = (0, 0)
        lst = []
        pk = (n + 1) // 2  # Corrected calculation for middle position
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            # Corrected conditions to check if at least half are satisfied
            if zero >= (i + 1) // 2 and one >= (n - i - 1) // 2:
                lst.append(i)
        if not lst:
            # Check if placing the road before the first house or after the last house satisfies the conditions
            if z >= (n + 1) // 2:
                lst.append(0)
            if o >= (n + 1) // 2:
                lst.append(n)
        # Find the position closest to the middle
        final = min(lst, key=lambda x: (abs(pk - x), x))
        print(final)

func()
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and should work correctly for the given problem.
