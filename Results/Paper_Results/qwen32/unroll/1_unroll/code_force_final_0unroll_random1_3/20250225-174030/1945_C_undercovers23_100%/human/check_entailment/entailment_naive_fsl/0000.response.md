Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Percentage Calculation Issue**: The code calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` as percentages (multiplied by 100), which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect comparisons. The problem description requires checking if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied, which can be directly checked using integer comparisons without converting to percentages.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not correctly handle cases where the road can be placed before the first house (position 0) or after the last house (position n). Specifically, the logic to check if the entire village can be on one side is flawed. The code incorrectly checks if `c1 >= 50` to decide if the road should be placed at position 0 or n, but it does not correctly account for the number of residents on each side.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of `pk`**: The variable `pk` is calculated as `n / 2`, but it is used as a floating-point number in comparisons. The problem description requires minimizing `|n/2 - i|`, and `pk` should be an integer for accurate comparisons.

4. **Logic for Minimum Distance Calculation**: The code calculates the minimum distance `mini` and then finds the smallest `i` that achieves this distance. However, it does not correctly handle the case where no valid `i` is found in the list `lst`, and the fallback logic to check the entire village does not account for all possible valid positions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        sl = list(s)
        o = sl.count('1')
        z = sl.count('0')
        (zero, one) = (0, 0)
        lst = []
        mini = float('inf')
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            if zero >= (i + 1) // 2 and one >= (o - one) // 2:
                lst.append(i)
        if not lst:
            if z >= n // 2:
                lst.append(0)
            if o >= (n - o) // 2:
                lst.append(n)
        for ele in lst:
            mini = min(mini, abs(n // 2 - ele))
        final = []
        for elem in lst:
            if abs(n // 2 - elem) == mini:
                final.append(elem)
        final.sort()
        print(final[0])

```

This corrected version directly checks the integer conditions for the number of residents on each side, handles the edge cases for placing the road before the first house or after the last house, and correctly calculates the minimum distance.
