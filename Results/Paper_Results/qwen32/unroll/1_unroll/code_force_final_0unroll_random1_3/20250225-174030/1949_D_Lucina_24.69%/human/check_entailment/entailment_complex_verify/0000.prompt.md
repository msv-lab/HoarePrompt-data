You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are designing a new video game. It has n scenarios, which the player may
play in any order, but each scenario must be played exactly once. When a
player switches from a scenario to another scenario, the game shows a
specially crafted transition video to make it all feel part of one big story.
This video is specific to a pair of scenarios, but not to their order, in
other words, the video playing when switching from scenario a to scenario b is
the same as the video playing when switching from scenario b to scenario a .
Therefore, you need to create \frac{n(n-1)}{2} different transition videos,
one for each possible pair of different scenarios.

Each transition video can be either funny or scary. It is boring to see too
many funny videos or too many scary videos in a row. Therefore, your goal is
to create the videos in such a way that no matter in which order does the
player approach the scenarios, they will never see more than \lceil
\frac{3n}{4} \rceil transition videos of the same type in a row.

You have already come up with ideas for at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor of
the transition videos, and therefore already know if those will be funny or
scary. Now you need to choose funny or scary for all other transition videos
in such a way that the above requirement is satisfied.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 24 ) — the number of
scenarios in the game.

The next n lines describe the partial transition video plan. Each of those
lines contains n characters. The j -th character of the i -th line corresponds
to the transition video between the i -th and the j -th scenarios. It will be
F if the corresponding transition video will be funny, S if the corresponding
transition video will be scary, ? if the corresponding transition video is
still undecided, or . if i=j .

It is guaranteed that the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th
character of the i -th line will be the same for all i and j . It is
guaranteed that at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor (n divided by 2, rounded
down) transition videos will already be decided, in other words, that at most
2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input will be F or S.

Output

Print n lines describing the full transition video plan in the same format as
the input. Each of those lines must contain n characters. The j -th character
of the i -th line must be F if the corresponding transition video is funny, S
if the corresponding transition video is scary, or . if i=j .

Each ? character from the input must be replaced with either F or S, and all
other characters from the input must remain unchanged. It must still hold that
the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th character of the i -th
line are the same for all i and j .

For each permutation of the n scenarios, it must hold that the transition
videos corresponding to playing the scenarios in this order do not have more
than \lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil (3n divided by 4, rounded up) videos of the
same type consecutively.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It can be proven that for
all inputs satisfying the constraints of this problem a solution always
exists.

Note

In the first sample: We are allowed \lceil \frac{3\cdot 5}{4} \rceil=4
transition videos of the same type in a row, but for any permutation of the 5
scenarios the player will see only 4 transition videos in total, therefore we
can choose funny or scary freely. We must still respect the already chosen
types.

In the second sample: One of the 479001600 possible permutations of scenarios
is 1, 7, 4, 12, 9, 8, 2, 6, 10, 3, 11, 5. The player will get the following
sequence of transition videos for this permutation: SSSSSSSSSFS. Even though
this sequence has 10 scary transition videos in total, it has only 9 scary
transition videos in a row, which is the maximum allowed amount (\lceil
\frac{3\cdot 12}{4} \rceil=9 ).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and an `n x n` matrix where each cell is either 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (if the row index equals the column index). It processes the matrix to replace '?' with 'F' or 'S' based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in each row and column, and prints the modified matrix. If there are more or equal 'F' counts without 'S' compared to 'S' counts without 'F', it prioritizes 'F' for undecided cells in the first `n // 4` rows or columns identified as having only 'F'. Otherwise, it prioritizes 'S'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code does not guarantee that no matter in which order the player approaches the scenarios, they will never see more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type in a row. 

The approach taken in the code is to distribute 'F' and 'S' based on the initial counts of 'F' and 'S' in the input matrix. However, this does not ensure that the constraint of having no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type is met for every possible permutation of scenarios.

Here's a specific counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
5
.FF??
F.F??
FF?.?
??.??
???.?
```

**Output from the code:**
```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.FF
FFF.?
FF?.?
```

**Explanation of the issue:**
- The code assigns 'F' and 'S' based on the initial counts and some heuristic (assigning 'F' to nodes with more 'F' connections and 'S' to nodes with more 'S' connections).
- However, for the permutation (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the sequence of transitions is "FFF", which violates the constraint because \(\lceil \frac{3 \cdot 5}{4} \rceil = 4\) and we have 3 consecutive 'F's.
- The code does not ensure that the constraint is met for all permutations, which is a requirement of the problem.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the constraint for all possible permutations of scenarios.
