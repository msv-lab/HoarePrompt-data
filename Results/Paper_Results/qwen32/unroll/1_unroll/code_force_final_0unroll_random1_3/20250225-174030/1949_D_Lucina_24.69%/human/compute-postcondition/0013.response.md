The for loop statement provided is:

```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `n` inclusive. To ensure that the loop can execute, the variable `n` must be at least 1. The variable `i` is the loop variable and is initialized to 1 at the start of the loop, so we don't need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.

The state before the loop starts includes several lists (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`), but according to the instruction, we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only `n`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is at least 1.

State: **`a` is a list where each element at index `i` (1 to n) contains the count of 'F' characters in the i-th row and column, `b` is a list where each element at index `i` (1 to n) contains the count of 'S' characters in the i-th row and column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all the input lines, `sa` is a list containing indices where there are 'F' characters but no 'S' characters, plus any additional indices where there are neither 'F' nor 'S' characters, and `sb` is a list containing indices where there are 'S' characters but no 'F' characters, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
