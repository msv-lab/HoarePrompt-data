Postcondition: **`a` is a list where each element at index `i` (1 to n) contains the count of 'F' characters in the i-th row and column, `b` is a list where each element at index `i` (1 to n) contains the count of 'S' characters in the i-th row and column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by all the input lines. If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, then `sa` includes additional indices where there are neither 'F' nor 'S' characters. Otherwise, `xx` has '?' characters replaced by 'S' in the first `n // 4` rows or columns specified in `sb`, and by 'F' elsewhere. `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged in the else case.**
