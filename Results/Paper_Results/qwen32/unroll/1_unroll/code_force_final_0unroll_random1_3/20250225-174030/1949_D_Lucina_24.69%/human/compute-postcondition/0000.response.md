The code snippet provided only reads an integer `n` from the input. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, and the input consists of `n` lines with specific character constraints. Since the provided code only reads `n` and does not modify any other variables or conditions specified in the initial state, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer read from the input, but all other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer read from the input (2 <= n <= 24), the input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is either 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' if i=j. The i-th character of the j-th line is the same as the j-th character of the i-th line for all i and j. There are at most floor(n/2) 'F' or 'S' characters in the input.**
