To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided loop:

The loop starts with `i` set to the last index of `arr` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1` (non-inclusive). In each iteration, it multiplies the current value of `tem` by the element of `arr` at the current index `i` and appends the result to `ans`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop:

1. `i` is initialized to the last index of `arr` (let's say `len(arr) - 1`).
2. `tem` is multiplied by `arr[i]`.
3. The new value of `tem` is appended to `ans`.
4. `i` is decremented by 1.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until `i` is less than 0.

After the loop completes, `ans` will contain the cumulative product of the elements of `arr` in reverse order. The final value of `tem` will be the product of all elements in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `ans` is a list where each element is the cumulative product of the elements of `arr` in reverse order; `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.**
