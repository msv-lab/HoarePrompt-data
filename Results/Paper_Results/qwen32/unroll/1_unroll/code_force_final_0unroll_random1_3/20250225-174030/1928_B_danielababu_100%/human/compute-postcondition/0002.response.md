The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the expression `len(arr) - 1`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. If `arr` has at least one integer, the loop can execute because `len(arr) - 1` will be a valid starting index for the loop.

To ensure the loop executes, `arr` must have at least one integer, and `i` should be initialized to `len(arr) - 1` as per the loop's starting condition.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**
