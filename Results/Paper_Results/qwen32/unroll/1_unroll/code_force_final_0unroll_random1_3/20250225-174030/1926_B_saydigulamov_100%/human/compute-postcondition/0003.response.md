Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and an `n × n` grid where each element is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square made up entirely of '1's, and the size of this shape is greater than 1. The function returns the coordinates of the top-left corner of the triangle or square and its size (side length for a square or height for a triangle).**
