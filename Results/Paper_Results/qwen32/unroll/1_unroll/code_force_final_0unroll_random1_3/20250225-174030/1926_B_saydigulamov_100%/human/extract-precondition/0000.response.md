Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and the grid is an n × n list of lists where each element is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that consists of all '1's, and the size of this shape is greater than 1.**
