You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and the grid is an n × n list of lists where each element is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that consists of all '1's, and the size of this shape is greater than 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly identifies whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle based on the provided problem description.

### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then for each test case, it reads the size `n` of the grid.
   - It then reads `n` lines of the grid and for each line, it counts the number of '1's, storing these counts in the list `k`.

2. **Logic to Determine Shape:**
   - The program checks if the first two counts of '1's in the list `k` are equal (`if k[0] == k[1]:`).
   - If they are equal, it prints "SQUARE".
   - Otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

### Analysis of Logic:

- **Square Detection:**
  - For a square, every row in the shape will have the same number of '1's. Hence, the counts in `k` will be equal for all rows containing '1's.
  - The program correctly identifies squares by checking if the first two counts are equal, assuming the square starts from the first row with '1's.

- **Triangle Detection:**
  - For a triangle, the number of '1's increases or decreases sequentially in each row. Therefore, the counts in `k` will not be equal for all rows containing '1's.
  - The program correctly identifies triangles by checking if the first two counts are not equal, assuming the triangle starts from the first row with '1's.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program assumes that the shape starts from the first row with '1's. This assumption is valid because the problem guarantees that the shape is either a square or a triangle and that it contains all '1's in the grid.
  - The program only checks the first two counts to determine the shape. However, this is sufficient for a square or a triangle as described in the problem.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the shapes (square or triangle), the program correctly identifies the shape based on the counts of '1's in the first two rows containing '1's. It handles the input and logic as required.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
