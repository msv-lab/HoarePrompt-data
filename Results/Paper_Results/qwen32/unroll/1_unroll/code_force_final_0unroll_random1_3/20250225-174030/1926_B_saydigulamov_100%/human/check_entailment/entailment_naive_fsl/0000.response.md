Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. The logic in the program is too simplistic and does not account for the specific patterns required for triangles and squares as described in the problem statement.

Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Squares**: The program checks if the first two rows with '1's have the same number of '1's. While this is true for squares, it does not guarantee that the entire shape is a square. The program does not check if all rows with '1's have the same number of '1's and if the '1's are positioned at equal distances from the left edge of the grid.

2. **Triangles**: The program does not check for the pattern of a triangle. A triangle has rows with an increasing (or decreasing) number of '1's, centered around a central column. The program does not verify this pattern.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3
001
011
111
```
**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```
**Actual Output:**
```
SQUARE
```
In this case, the program incorrectly identifies the shape as a square because the first two rows with '1's have different counts of '1's (1 and 2, respectively), but the shape is actually a triangle.

Another example:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0001
0011
0111
1111
```
**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```
**Actual Output:**
```
SQUARE
```
Again, the program incorrectly identifies the shape as a square because the first two rows with '1's have different counts of '1's (1 and 2, respectively), but the shape is actually a triangle.

The program needs to be more sophisticated to correctly identify the shape based on the patterns described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
