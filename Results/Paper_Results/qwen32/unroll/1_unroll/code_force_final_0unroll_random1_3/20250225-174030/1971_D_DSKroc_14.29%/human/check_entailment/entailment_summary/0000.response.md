### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of contiguous pieces a binary string can be cut into, so that rearranging these pieces results in a sorted binary string (all '0's before all '1's). 

The provided program calculates the number of pieces needed by counting the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' in the string (a "drop" in the sequence from '1' to '0'). Each such drop indicates that a cut is necessary to separate the segments that need to be rearranged. The program then adds 1 to this count to account for the initial segment before any drops occur.

Let's analyze the logic:
- If there are no '1's followed by '0's, the string is already sorted, and the result should be 1.
- Each '1' followed by a '0' indicates a boundary where a cut is necessary to separate the segments. So, if there are `k` such drops, the string needs to be cut into `k + 1` pieces.

Let's verify this with the examples:

1. **Test Case: `11010`**
   - Drops: `1` (at index 1 and 3)
   - Result: `2 + 1 = 3`
   
2. **Test Case: `00000000`**
   - Drops: `0`
   - Result: `0 + 1 = 1`
   
3. **Test Case: `1`**
   - Drops: `0`
   - Result: `0 + 1 = 1`
   
4. **Test Case: `10`**
   - Drops: `1` (at index 0)
   - Result: `1 + 1 = 2`
   
5. **Test Case: `0001111`**
   - Drops: `0`
   - Result: `0 + 1 = 1`
   
6. **Test Case: `0110`**
   - Drops: `1` (at index 1)
   - Result: `1 + 1 = 2`

The program correctly computes the number of pieces required for each test case based on the described logic.

### Correctness: **True**
