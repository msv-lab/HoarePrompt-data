You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        print(count + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        
        print(count + 1)
        
    #State: For each test case, the number of segments the string `s` can be divided into such that each segment is non-decreasing is printed. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `s` is the last input string processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of pieces a binary string must be cut into so that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's). The key observation is that the number of cuts needed is equal to the number of times a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string. This is because each such occurrence represents a boundary where the string transitions from '1's to '0's, which cannot be part of a sorted binary string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the provided program:
1. The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the binary string `s`.
3. It initializes a counter `count` to 0.
4. It iterates through the string `s` from the first character to the second-to-last character.
5. For each character, it checks if the current character is '1' and the next character is '0'. If so, it increments the `count` by 1.
6. After the loop, it prints `count + 1`, which represents the minimum number of pieces required.

The logic is correct because:
- Each time a '1' is followed by a '0', it indicates a boundary that must be a cut point to separate the '1's and '0's.
- The number of such boundaries plus one gives the minimum number of pieces needed.

Correctness: **True**
