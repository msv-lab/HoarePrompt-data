Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500. For each of the following `t` lines, it receives a single string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1', with 1 ≤ |`s`| ≤ 500. The function processes each string and returns the count of '1's in each string.**
