Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) where `n` is the size of the square grid and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell. The function returns a result indicating whether it is possible to color at least `k` diagonals with at least one colored cell in the given `n` x `n` grid for each test case.**
