Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases for determining if it is possible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the logic for determining when it is possible to have a tower with `m` cubes is flawed.

Let's break down the problem:
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move.
- After `n` moves, the number of cubes `m` in the tower must be achievable by adding or removing cubes.

The key insight is that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even because each move changes the number of cubes by 1 (either +1 or -1). Therefore, after an even number of moves, the difference between `n` and `m` must also be even. This means that `n - m` must be even, which is equivalent to `n % 2 == m % 2`.

The provided program incorrectly handles some cases:
- It checks if `n == m`, which is correct.
- It checks if `m > n`, which is correct.
- It checks if `m == n - 1`, which is incorrect. The condition should be based on the parity of `n` and `m`.
- It checks if `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` and `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`, which is correct for ensuring the parity condition, but it does not cover all cases.

Here is a counterexample where the program gives an incorrect answer:
- Input: `1 2 1`
  - Expected Output: `Yes` (Nikita can add a cube and then remove it to end up with 1 cube).
  - Program Output: `No` (because it does not correctly handle the parity condition).

A corrected version of the program would be:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least the number of cubes `m` and that the difference `n - m` is even, which is the correct condition for the problem.
