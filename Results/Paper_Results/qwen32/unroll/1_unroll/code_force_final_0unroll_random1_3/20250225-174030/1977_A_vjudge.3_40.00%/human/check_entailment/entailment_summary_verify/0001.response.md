Let's carefully analyze the problem and the program to determine if the original assessment is correct.

### Problem Analysis
Nikita can either add or remove one cube in each move. We need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves starting from no cubes.

### Key Observations
1. **If `m > n`**: It's impossible because each move can add at most 1 cube.
2. **If `n == m`**: It's possible because Nikita can simply add 1 cube in each of the `n` moves.
3. **If `m == n - 1`**: It's possible because Nikita can add 1 cube in each of the `n` moves except for one move where he removes a cube.
4. **If `m < n - 1`**: It's possible if the net addition is `m` cubes. This can be achieved by adding cubes in some moves and removing cubes in others. The key here is that the difference `n - m` must be even because each removal cancels out an addition (one add and one remove is a net of zero cubes).

### Program Analysis
The program checks the following conditions:
- If `n == m`, it prints "Yes".
- If `m > n`, it prints "No".
- If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes".
- If both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd, it prints "Yes".
- Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Evaluation of Conditions
1. **If `n == m`**: Correct.
2. **If `m > n`**: Correct.
3. **If `m == n - 1`**: Correct.
4. **If both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd**: This condition is incorrect. The correct condition should be that `n - m` must be even, not just the parity of `m` and `n`. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 1`, `n - m = 4` (even), so it should be "Yes", but the program will print "No" because `m` and `n` have different parities.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The program is incorrect due to the incorrect parity check instead of checking if `n - m` is even.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
