You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: After executing the loop for all `t` test cases, the program will have printed 'Yes' or 'No' for each pair of integers `n` and `m` based on the given conditions. The state of `t` remains unchanged, and no other variables from the initial state are affected.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on specific conditions. The conditions are: print 'Yes' if `n` equals `m`, if `m` is exactly one less than `n`, or if both `n` and `m` are either even or odd. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not modify `t` or any other input variables beyond using them to determine the output for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases for determining if it is possible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the logic for determining when it is possible to have a tower with `m` cubes is flawed.

Let's break down the problem:
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move.
- After `n` moves, the number of cubes `m` in the tower must be achievable by adding or removing cubes.

The key insight is that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even because each move changes the number of cubes by 1 (either +1 or -1). Therefore, after an even number of moves, the difference between `n` and `m` must also be even. This means that `n - m` must be even, which is equivalent to `n % 2 == m % 2`.

The provided program incorrectly handles some cases:
- It checks if `n == m`, which is correct.
- It checks if `m > n`, which is correct.
- It checks if `m == n - 1`, which is incorrect. The condition should be based on the parity of `n` and `m`.
- It checks if `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` and `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`, which is correct for ensuring the parity condition, but it does not cover all cases.

Here is a counterexample where the program gives an incorrect answer:
- Input: `1 2 1`
  - Expected Output: `Yes` (Nikita can add a cube and then remove it to end up with 1 cube).
  - Program Output: `No` (because it does not correctly handle the parity condition).

A corrected version of the program would be:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least the number of cubes `m` and that the difference `n - m` is even, which is the correct condition for the problem.
