Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) which is the largest number Vladislav writes on the board. `N` is 200001.**

Explanation: The value of `N` is explicitly set to `int(2 * 100000.0) + 1`, which evaluates to 200001. The initial state of the input conditions remains unchanged.
