Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) which is the largest number Vladislav writes on the board. `N` is 200001; `t` is an input integer; `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros.**

In simple terms: The input values `t` and the `n` values for each test case remain the same. A new variable `pd` is created, which is a list containing 200001 zeros.
