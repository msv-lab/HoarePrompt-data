You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates a value based on these counts and prints the result. The calculation involves checking if the counts of ones, twos, and threes are equal and odd, and then summing half the counts of each number (rounded down). The output is one line per test case containing the calculated value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The game revolves around the bitwise XOR of a sequence of integers. The winning condition for Alice is that the XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero. Conversely, Bob wins if the XOR is zero. Eve, who is the judge, removes one number at a time from the sequence, and she wants Bob to win as many times as possible.

The key to solving the problem lies in understanding the properties of XOR:
- XOR of a number with itself is zero (i.e., `a ^ a = 0`).
- XOR of a number with zero is the number itself (i.e., `a ^ 0 = a`).

Given the constraints that each integer in the sequence is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, we can observe the following:
- The XOR of all numbers in the sequence will be zero if the count of each number that contributes to the XOR parity (1 and 3 for odd counts) is even.
- The XOR of all numbers in the sequence will be non-zero if the count of at least one of the numbers contributing to the XOR parity is odd.

### Strategy for Eve

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins. This means she should aim to leave an even count of 1s and 3s in the sequence after each removal. Here's how she can do it:
1. If the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s are such that the XOR is zero initially (i.e., the counts of 1s and 3s are both even), Bob wins immediately.
2. If the XOR is non-zero initially, Eve can remove numbers to make the XOR zero in subsequent rounds.

### Key Observations

1. **Initial XOR Zero:** If the XOR of the initial sequence is zero (i.e., the counts of 1s and 3s are both even), Bob wins in the first round.
2. **Initial XOR Non-Zero:** If the XOR of the initial sequence is non-zero, Eve can remove numbers to make the XOR zero in subsequent rounds. Specifically:
   - If the counts of 1s and 3s are both odd, Eve can remove one 1 and one 3 to make both counts even.
   - If only the count of 1s (or 3s) is odd, Eve can remove one 1 (or 3) to make the count even.
   - The count of 2s and 4s does not affect the XOR parity, so Eve can remove any number of 2s and 4s without changing the XOR parity.

### Calculation of Bob's Wins

- **Initial XOR Zero:** Bob wins once in the first round.
- **Initial XOR Non-Zero:** Eve can make the XOR zero in the subsequent rounds by removing pairs of 1s and 3s or single 1s/3s. The number of times Bob can win is determined by the number of such operations Eve can perform.

### Program Analysis

The provided program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win as follows:
1. It checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are equal and odd. If so, it increments the count by 1 because Bob wins in the first round.
2. It then adds half the count of each number to the total count. This part seems to be incorrect because it does not correctly account for the optimal removal strategy.

### Correctness

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Eve. Specifically, the part where it adds half the count of each number to the total count is not correct. The correct approach should be to count the number of pairs of 1s and 3s and single 1s/3s that Eve can remove to make the XOR zero.

### Correct Implementation

A correct implementation should be:
- Check if the initial XOR is zero (i.e., counts of 1s and 3s are even). If so, Bob wins once.
- Otherwise, count the number of pairs of 1s and 3s and single 1s/3s that Eve can remove to make the XOR zero.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Correctness: **False**
