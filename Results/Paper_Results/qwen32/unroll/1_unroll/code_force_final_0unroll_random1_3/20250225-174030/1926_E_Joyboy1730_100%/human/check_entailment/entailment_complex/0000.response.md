Let's break down the program and verify its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated states.

### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cards) and `k` (position of the card to find).

2. **List `L` Construction:**
   - The list `L` is constructed to represent the counts of cards laid down in each step. The steps are based on multiples of odd numbers.
   - `m = (n + 1) // 2` calculates the number of odd-numbered cards up to `n`. These are laid down first.
   - `n -= m` reduces `n` by the number of odd-numbered cards laid down.
   - `L.append(m)` stores the count of odd-numbered cards in `L`.
   - This process repeats until all cards are laid down.

3. **Calculating the `k`-th Card:**
   - The variable `tot` keeps track of the total number of cards laid down so far.
   - The variable `pow` starts at 1 and is doubled in each iteration to represent the multiplier for the current step (1, 2, 3, 4, ...).
   - For each count `a` in `L`, the program checks if `k` falls within the range of cards laid down in this step.
   - If `k` is within the range, it calculates the `k`-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - `tot` is incremented by `a` to account for the cards laid down in the current step.
   - `pow` is doubled to move to the next step.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the first test case `n=7, k=1`:
- `L` construction: 
  - First step: `m = (7 + 1) // 2 = 4` (odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7). `L = [4]`, `n = 3`.
  - Second step: `m = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2` (even numbers: 2, 6). `L = [4, 2]`, `n = 1`.
  - Third step: `m = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1` (even number: 4). `L = [4, 2, 1]`, `n = 0`.
- `L = [4, 2, 1]` represents the counts of cards laid down in each step.
- Calculation for `k=1`:
  - `tot = 0`, `pow = 1`.
  - First step: `tot < k <= tot + a` (0 < 1 <= 4). The `k`-th card is `1 * (2 * (1 - 0) - 1) = 1`.

The program correctly outputs `1` for the first test case. Similar checks can be done for other test cases to ensure correctness.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the `k`-th card based on the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
