The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is an empty list, and `idx_A` is an empty list. The values of `s`, `A`, and `idx_A` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted. We need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
