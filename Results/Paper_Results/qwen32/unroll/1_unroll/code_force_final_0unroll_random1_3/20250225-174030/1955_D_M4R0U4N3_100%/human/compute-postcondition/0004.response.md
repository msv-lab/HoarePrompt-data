Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b`. The integer `n` represents the length of list `a`, `m` represents the length of list `b`, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n. Each element in list `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, and each element in list `b` is also an integer between 1 and 10^6. The function processes these inputs for each test case and returns a result based on the provided constraints.**
