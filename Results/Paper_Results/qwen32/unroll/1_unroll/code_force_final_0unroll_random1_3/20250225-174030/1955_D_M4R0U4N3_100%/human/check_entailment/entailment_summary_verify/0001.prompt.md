You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers `a` and `b`, and two integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. For each test case, it calculates how many contiguous subarrays of length `m` in list `a` contain at least `k` elements that also appear in list `b`. The result for each test case is printed, indicating the count of such subarrays.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given problem requires counting the number of subarrays of length `m` in array `a` that can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of array `b`.

The provided code uses a sliding window approach to efficiently count the number of good subarrays. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `max_val` is set to the maximum possible value of elements in `a` and `b` (1,000,000).
   - `cnt_b` is an array of size `max_val + 1` initialized to 0. This array will store the count of each element in `b`.

2. **Reading Inputs**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are read.
   - Arrays `a` and `b` are read.

3. **Processing the First Window**:
   - The count of each element in `b` is stored in `cnt_b`.
   - A set `b_values` is created to store unique elements of `b`.
   - The first window of length `m` in `a` is processed to determine how many of its elements can be matched with elements in `b`. This is done using the `cnt_b` array.
   - If the count of matched elements `curr` is at least `k`, `ans` is incremented.

4. **Sliding the Window**:
   - For each subsequent window, the code updates the count of elements entering and leaving the window.
   - If an element leaving the window was part of the match, `curr` is decremented.
   - If an element entering the window can be matched, `curr` is incremented.
   - If `curr` is at least `k` after updating, `ans` is incremented.

5. **Output**:
   - The number of good subarrays for the current test case is printed.
   - The `cnt_b` array is reset for the next test case.

### Correctness:

The sliding window approach ensures that each element of `a` is processed only twice (once when entering and once when leaving the window), making the solution efficient with a time complexity of O(n * t) where `n` is the total number of elements in all arrays `a` across all test cases. Given the constraints, this approach is feasible.

The logic for counting matches and updating the window is correct. The use of the `cnt_b` array ensures that the count of elements in `b` is accurately tracked, and the set `b_values` efficiently checks if an element can be matched.

Therefore, the provided program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
