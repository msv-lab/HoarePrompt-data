Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`. Specifically, it computes a value `mn` as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`, and then prints the sum of the integer divisions of `mn` by `a` and `mn` by `b`, adding 1 to the result if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1.**
