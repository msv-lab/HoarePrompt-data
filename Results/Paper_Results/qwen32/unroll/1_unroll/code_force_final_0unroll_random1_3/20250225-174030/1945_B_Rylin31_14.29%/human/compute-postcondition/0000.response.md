The code snippet provided only reads the first integer input, which is `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases that follow. The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10,000. After executing the code, the value of `t` is set to the integer value read from the input. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.**
