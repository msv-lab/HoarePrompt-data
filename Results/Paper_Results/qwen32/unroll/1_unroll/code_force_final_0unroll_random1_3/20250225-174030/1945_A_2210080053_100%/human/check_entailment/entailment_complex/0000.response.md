To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze the logic and the implementation step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert needs a tent by themselves, so `a` tents are required for introverts.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert needs to share a tent with two others. Thus, extroverts need to be grouped in sets of three. The number of tents needed for extroverts is `ceil(b/3)`.
3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can be used to fill up any incomplete groups of extroverts or can be placed alone. 

The key points to consider are:
- If `b` (extroverts) is not a multiple of 3, then there will be a remainder of either 1 or 2 extroverts. 
- If the remainder is 1, we need one more universal to complete the group, otherwise, if the remainder is 2, we need two more universals.
- If there are not enough universals to complete the groups of extroverts, it's impossible to satisfy the conditions, and the answer should be `-1`.
- If there are enough universals, the total number of tents needed is `a` (for introverts) plus `ceil(b/3)` (for extroverts).

### Program Analysis:
The program provided attempts to compute the number of tents as follows:
- It reads the input values `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.
- It combines `b` and `c` into `b` (i.e., `b += c`), which is not correct as it does not properly account for the remainder of extroverts and the need for universals.
- It then computes the number of tents using the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`. This expression is intended to:
  - Compute `a + ceil(b/3)` as `a + (b + 2) // 3` (which is equivalent to `a + -b // 3` due to the way Python handles negative floor division).
  - Return `-1` if there are not enough universals to complete the groups of extroverts.

### Issues in the Program:
- The combining of `b` and `c` (`b += c`) is incorrect because it does not properly separate the logic for extroverts and universals.
- The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is not correctly handling the logic for determining the number of tents and checking if there are enough universals.

### Correct Implementation:
To fix the program, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of complete groups of extroverts (`b // 3`).
2. Calculate the remainder of extroverts (`b % 3`).
3. Check if there are enough universals to complete the groups:
   - If the remainder is 1, we need one more universal.
   - If the remainder is 2, we need two more universals.
4. If there are not enough universals, return `-1`.
5. Otherwise, return `a + ceil(b/3)`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the provided program, the implementation is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
