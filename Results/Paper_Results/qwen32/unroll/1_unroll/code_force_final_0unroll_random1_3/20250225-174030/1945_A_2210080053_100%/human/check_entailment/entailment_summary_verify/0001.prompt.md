You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a number of test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, it computes and prints a specific integer value derived from these inputs. The primary output is a series of printed values corresponding to each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

We need to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate introverts, extroverts, and universals according to their preferences. Here are the rules:
1. Each introvert must be alone in a tent.
2. Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
3. Universals can be in any kind of tent.

The constraints are:
- Each test case contains three integers: `a` (introverts), `b` (extroverts), and `c` (universals).
- We need to find the minimum number of tents or output `-1` if it's impossible to satisfy all conditions.

### Logic for Solution

1. **Introverts**: Each introvert requires a tent by themselves. Therefore, `a` tents are needed for introverts.
2. **Extroverts**: Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others. Therefore, we need `b / 3` tents for extroverts, where `b` is the number of extroverts. Since we can't have a fraction of a tent, we take the ceiling of `b / 3`. Mathematically, this can be represented as `ceil(b / 3)`, or equivalently `(b + 2) // 3` in integer arithmetic.
3. **Universals**: Universals can fill up the remaining spots in the tents for extroverts or form their own tents. If after accommodating extroverts, there are `b % 3` extroverts left, we need to find a way to pair them up with universals. If `b % 3` is non-zero, we need at least `b % 3` universals to pair with these extroverts. If we don't have enough universals, it's impossible to accommodate everyone.

### Correctness of the Program

The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:
```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

Let's break down this program:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Combining Extroverts and Universals**: The line `b += c` combines the number of extroverts and universals into a single variable `b`. This is not correct because we need to treat extroverts and universals differently.
3. **Calculating Tents**:
   - `a - -b // 3`: This part of the code is trying to calculate the number of tents. However, the use of `- -b // 3` is not the correct way to calculate the number of tents for extroverts and universals.
   - `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`: This part is trying to handle the case where there are not enough universals to pair with leftover extroverts. However, the logic is incorrect because it doesn't properly account for the number of tents needed.

### Correct Approach

The correct approach would be:
1. Calculate the number of tents needed for introverts: `a`.
2. Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals:
   - First, see how many tents we can fill with extroverts: `b // 3`.
   - If there are leftover extroverts (`b % 3`), we need to find universals to pair with them. If the number of leftover extroverts is greater than the number of universals, it's impossible.
   - If there are enough universals, we can pair them with the leftover extroverts and form additional tents with the remaining universals.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
