Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for calculating the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend is flawed. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that Kirill can perform multiple swaps to reach his desired position, and it does not correctly handle the costs associated with swapping positions.

Here are some issues with the program:
1. The program only considers swapping with the person directly in front of Kirill and does not explore all possible swaps.
2. The logic for calculating the cost of swapping is incorrect and does not consider the cumulative cost of bribing people between the two positions.
3. The program does not correctly handle the case where Kirill needs to swap multiple times to reach the desired position.

A correct approach would involve using a priority queue or a similar data structure to efficiently find the minimum cost to move Kirill to one of the first `m` positions. The program needs to be rewritten to correctly implement this logic.
