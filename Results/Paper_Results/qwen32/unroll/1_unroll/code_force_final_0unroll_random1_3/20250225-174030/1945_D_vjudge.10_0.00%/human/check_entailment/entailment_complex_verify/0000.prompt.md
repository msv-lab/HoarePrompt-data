You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

        print(c)
        
    #State: Each integer in the list `custos` is printed on a new line. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `m` and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates a specific cost based on the values in `a` and `b` and prints this cost. The function does not modify the input values but outputs a computed value for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first m people in the queue. Let's analyze why the code is incorrect through a specific example.

### Example Case:
```
Input:
1
5 3
7 3 6 9 2
4 3 8 5 1
```
### Expected Output:
```
11
```
### Explanation of Expected Output:
- Kirill can bribe the person at position 5 (with a_5 = 2 and b_5 = 1) to move to the end of the line. This costs 2 coins.
- Then, Kirill can bribe the person at position 4 (with a_4 = 9 and b_4 = 5) to move to the end of the line. This costs 9 coins, but since Kirill is already at position 4, he only needs to pay the b_k coins for the people between positions 4 and 5, which is 1 coin.
- Total cost: 2 (to move person 5) + 1 (to move person 4 past person 5) = 3 coins.
- Now, Kirill can bribe the person at position 3 (with a_3 = 6 and b_3 = 8) to move to the end of the line. This costs 6 coins, but since Kirill is already at position 3, he only needs to pay the b_k coins for the people between positions 3 and 4, which is 5 coins.
- Total cost: 3 (previous) + 6 (to move person 3) + 5 (to move person 3 past person 4) = 14 coins.
- Finally, Kirill can bribe the person at position 2 (with a_2 = 3 and b_2 = 3) to move to the end of the line. This costs 3 coins, but since Kirill is already at position 2, he only needs to pay the b_k coins for the people between positions 2 and 3, which is 8 coins.
- Total cost: 14 (previous) + 3 (to move person 2) + 8 (to move person 2 past person 3) = 25 coins.
- However, Kirill can achieve his goal by bribing the person at position 5 first (2 coins), then bribing the person at position 4 (1 coin), then bribing the person at position 3 (5 coins), and finally bribing the person at position 2 (3 coins).
- Total cost: 2 (to move person 5) + 1 (to move person 4 past person 5) + 5 (to move person 3 past person 4 and 5) + 3 (to move person 2 past person 3, 4, and 5) = 11 coins.

### Why the Code Fails:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the cost. It incorrectly calculates the cost by not considering the optimal sequence of bribes and the cumulative cost of moving people past each other. The code seems to be attempting to calculate the cost based on a fixed sequence of bribes rather than finding the minimum cost sequence.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly handle the problem requirements and fails to provide the correct output for the given example. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **False**.
