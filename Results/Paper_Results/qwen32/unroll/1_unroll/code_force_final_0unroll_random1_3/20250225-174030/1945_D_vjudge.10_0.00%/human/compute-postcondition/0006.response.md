The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m` where `m` is less than or equal to `n`. It also accepts two lists `a` and `b`, each containing `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns some output for each test case. Specifically:

- **Case_1:** For each test case, if the conditions on `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are satisfied, the function computes and returns a specific value based on the provided lists and integers.
- **Case_2:** Given the constraints, if the inputs do not meet the specified conditions (though the problem does not explicitly outline how to handle invalid inputs), the behavior is not defined in the provided information.

Since the exact computation or return value for each test case is not detailed in the provided output, we can only describe the functionality in terms of the inputs it accepts and the general structure of its output.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `m` (with `m` <= `n`), and two lists `a` and `b` each of length `n`. It returns a computed value for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
