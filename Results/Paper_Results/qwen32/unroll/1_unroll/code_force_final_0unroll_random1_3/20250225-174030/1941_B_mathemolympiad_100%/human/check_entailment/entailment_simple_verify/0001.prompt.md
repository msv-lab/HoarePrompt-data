You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem involves an array of integers, and we need to determine whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using a specific operation. The operation allows us to choose an index `i` and decrease `a[i-1]` by 1, `a[i]` by 2, and `a[i+1]` by 1, provided `i` is between 2 and `n-1` (inclusive).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, and for each test case, it processes an array of integers. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the length of the array `n` is read, followed by the array elements.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates over the array from the first element to the third last element (i.e., from index 0 to `n-3`).
   - For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the number of operations `opNum` that can be performed, which is equal to `a[i]`.
   - It then subtracts `opNum` from `a[i]`, `2 * opNum` from `a[i+1]`, and `opNum` from `a[i+2]`.
   - If at any point an element becomes negative, it prints "NO" and moves to the next test case.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After processing all possible operations, the program checks if the last two elements (`a[n-2]` and `a[n-1]`) are zero.
   - If they are not, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program:
- **Negative Values:** The program correctly checks for negative values during the operations, but it does not ensure that the last two elements are non-negative before the final check.
- **Final Check Logic:** The program checks if the last two elements are zero, but it does not account for the possibility that the operations might have made the elements negative, which would mean it's impossible to make them zero.
- **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle cases where the initial values of the last two elements are non-zero and cannot be reduced to zero through the allowed operations.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly handle all scenarios. Specifically, it does not ensure that the operations do not result in negative values in the last two elements, and it does not account for cases where the last two elements cannot be reduced to zero through the allowed operations.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
