You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Indexing and Operation Application**:
   The program iterates through the array from index `0` to `n-3` (inclusive) and applies the operation at each index `i`. However, the operation is defined for indices `i` such that `2 <= i <= n-1`. The program is incorrectly applying the operation starting from index `0`, which is outside the valid range.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Array Elements**:
   The program subtracts `opNum`, `2 * opNum`, and `opNum` from `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]` respectively. However, it does not ensure that the elements remain non-negative after each operation, which is a requirement of the problem.

3. **Incorrect Final Check**:
   The program checks if the last two elements of the array (`a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`) are zero to determine if the operation was successful. This is not sufficient to ensure that all elements of the array are zero. The program should check all elements of the array.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   The program does not handle cases where the initial elements of the array are such that the operations cannot be applied in a way that makes all elements zero.

To illustrate the incorrectness, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

The provided program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this test case because it starts applying the operation from index `0`, which is not valid. The correct approach should start from index `2` and ensure that operations are applied only when the elements are non-negative after each operation.

Thus, the program is incorrect and needs to be revised to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
