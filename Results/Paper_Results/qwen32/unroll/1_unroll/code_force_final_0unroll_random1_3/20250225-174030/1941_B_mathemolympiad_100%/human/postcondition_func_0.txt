The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it checks if the list can be reduced to all zeros by applying a specific operation: subtracting a value from three consecutive elements in the list. If the list can be reduced to all zeros, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
