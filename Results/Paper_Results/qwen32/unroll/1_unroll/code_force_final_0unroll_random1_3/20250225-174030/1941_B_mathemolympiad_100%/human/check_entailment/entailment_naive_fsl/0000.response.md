Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Indexing and Operation Application**:
   The program iterates through the array from index `0` to `n-3` (inclusive) and applies the operation at each index `i`. However, the operation is defined for indices `i` such that `2 <= i <= n-1`. The program is incorrectly applying the operation starting from index `0`, which is outside the valid range.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Array Elements**:
   The program subtracts `opNum`, `2 * opNum`, and `opNum` from `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]` respectively. However, it does not ensure that the elements remain non-negative after each operation, which is a requirement of the problem.

3. **Incorrect Final Check**:
   The program checks if the last two elements of the array (`a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`) are zero to determine if the operation was successful. This is not sufficient to ensure that all elements of the array are zero. The program should check all elements of the array.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   The program does not handle cases where the initial elements of the array are such that the operations cannot be applied in a way that makes all elements zero.

To illustrate the incorrectness, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

The provided program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this test case because it starts applying the operation from index `0`, which is not valid. The correct approach should start from index `2` and ensure that operations are applied only when the elements are non-negative after each operation.

Thus, the program is incorrect and needs to be revised to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
