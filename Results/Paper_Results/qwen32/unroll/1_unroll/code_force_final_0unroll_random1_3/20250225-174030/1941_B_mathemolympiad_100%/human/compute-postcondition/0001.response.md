For the given task, we need to adjust the state based on the loop head provided in the for loop statement. The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(0, numTest):`. The only variable that can be adjusted here is `numTest`.

The loop will execute if `numTest` is greater than 0 because the `range(0, numTest)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `numTest`. If `numTest` is 0, the range will be empty and the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state before the loop starts, `numTest` is already described as an integer such that 1 ≤ `numTest` ≤ 10^4. This means `numTest` is guaranteed to be greater than 0, and the loop will execute as expected.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `numTest` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`numTest` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `numTest` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `a_j` ≤ 10^9. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
