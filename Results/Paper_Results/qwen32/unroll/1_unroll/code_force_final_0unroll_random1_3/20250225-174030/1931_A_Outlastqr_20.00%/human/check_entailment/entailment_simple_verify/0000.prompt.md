You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the value assigned in the last iteration (an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78), `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Input:** An integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded sum of the positions of the three lowercase Latin letters.
2. **Output:** The lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded to `n`.
3. **Lexicographical Order:** A string `a` is lexicographically smaller than a string `b` if:
   - `a` is a prefix of `b` but `a ≠ b`, or
   - In the first position where `a` and `b` differ, `a` has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`.

### Provided Program:
```python
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Logic for Different Ranges of `n`:**
   - **When `n > 52`:** The program sets the first letter to `alphabet[n - 53]` and the last two letters to `'zz'`.
     - Example: For `n = 78`, `word = alphabet[78 - 53] + 'zz' = alphabet[25] + 'zz' = 'z' + 'zz' = 'zzz'`. This is incorrect because the lexicographically smallest word for `n = 78` should be `'rzz'`.
   - **When `26 < n ≤ 52`:** The program sets the first letter to `'a'`, the second letter to `alphabet[n - 28]`, and the last letter to `'z'`.
     - Example: For `n = 55`, `word = 'a' + alphabet[55 - 28] + 'z' = 'a' + alphabet[27] + 'z'`. Since `alphabet[27]` is out of bounds, this will throw an error or provide incorrect results.
   - **When `3 ≤ n ≤ 26`:** The program sets the first two letters to `'aa'` and the last letter to `alphabet[n - 3]`.
     - Example: For `n = 24`, `word = 'aa' + alphabet[24 - 3] = 'aa' + alphabet[21] = 'aa' + 'v' = 'aav'`. This is correct.

### Edge Cases and Errors:
1. **When `n > 52`:** The program does not correctly compute the lexicographically smallest word.
2. **When `26 < n ≤ 52`:** The program attempts to access an out-of-bounds index in the `alphabet` string.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases and fails to produce the lexicographically smallest word for `n > 52` and incorrectly handles `26 < n ≤ 52`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
- The program fails to correctly compute the lexicographically smallest word for `n > 52` and incorrectly handles `26 < n ≤ 52`, leading to incorrect results or errors.
