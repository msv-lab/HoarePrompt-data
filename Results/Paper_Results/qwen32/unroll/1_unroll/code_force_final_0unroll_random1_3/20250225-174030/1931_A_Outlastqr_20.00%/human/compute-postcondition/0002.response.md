To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, let's analyze the provided code snippet and how it modifies the variables `n` and `word` during each iteration. Note that `t` is the number of iterations and does not change within the loop. `n` is re-assigned in each iteration with a new input value, and `word` is constructed based on the value of `n`. The `alphabet` string remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.

The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will:
1. Read a new value for `n`.
2. Construct a `word` based on the value of `n`:
   - If `n > 52`, it constructs a word using the character at index `n - 53` in the alphabet, followed by 'zz'.
   - If `n > 26`, it constructs a word starting with 'a', followed by the character at index `n - 28` in the alphabet, and ending with 'z'.
   - If `n <= 26`, it constructs a word starting with 'aa', followed by the character at index `n - 3` in the alphabet.
3. Print the constructed `word`.

Since the value of `n` is re-assigned in each iteration, and `word` is constructed anew for each iteration, the final output state will only reflect the state of `n` and `word` after the last iteration. The initial values of `t` and `alphabet` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the value assigned in the last iteration (an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78), `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.
