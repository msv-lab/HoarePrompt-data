### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that there is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`, but for all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

The core logic of the program is implemented in `func_14()`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how `func_14()` works:

1. **Binary Representation**: Convert `n` and `k` to their binary representations.
2. **Handling `k = 1` Case**:
   - If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, return `[2]` as the sequence.
   - Otherwise, construct the sequence starting with `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
3. **General Case**:
   - Construct the sequence starting with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
   - Append `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to the sequence to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - Append `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence.
   - Append additional powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

The program uses these steps to construct a sequence that satisfies the problem requirements. The correctness of the program can be verified by checking if the generated sequence meets the conditions for different values of `n` and `k`.

Based on the provided examples and the logic of `func_14()`, the program appears to correctly handle the constraints and generate the required sequence.

### Correctness: **True**

The program correctly constructs the sequence for each test case according to the problem's requirements, and the examples provided in the problem statement are satisfied by the output generated by the program.
