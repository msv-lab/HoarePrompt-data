The code snippet appends `2 * k + 1` to the list `ans`. The initial state of `ans` is a list containing the powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, and then `k + 1`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`) remain unchanged.

After executing the code, `ans` will now include the additional element `2 * k + 1` at the end of the list.

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing the powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`) remain unchanged.**
