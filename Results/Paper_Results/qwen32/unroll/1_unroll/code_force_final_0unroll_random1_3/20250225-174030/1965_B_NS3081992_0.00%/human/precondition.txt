d is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ d ≤ 1000). processing is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the parameters for each test case. da and rank are not used in the problem description and do not have defined preconditions based on the given information.
