Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The problem requires us to generate a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

The program defines several utility functions for input handling and a few other operations, but the core logic for generating the sequence is implemented in `func_14()`.

Here's a breakdown of the logic in `func_14()`:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function reads `n` and `k` from the input.
2. **Binary Conversion**: It converts `n` to its binary representation and calculates its length.
3. **Special Case (k == 1)**:
   - If `n == 2`, it returns `[2]` as the sequence.
   - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and then adds powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
4. **General Case (k > 1)**:
   - It converts `k` to its binary representation and calculates its length.
   - It initializes the sequence `ans` with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` (excluding the highest bit).
   - It calculates the next element to add to ensure the sum of the sequence does not equal `k` and adds it to `ans`.
   - It adds `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence.
   - It adds powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

The program then prints the size of the sequence and the sequence itself for each test case.

### Analysis:

- The program correctly handles the special case where `k == 1`.
- For the general case, the program ensures that the sum of any subsequence of `a` does not equal `k` by carefully constructing the sequence.
- The program also ensures that for all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v` by using powers of 2 and strategically chosen additional numbers.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to generate the required sequence for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
