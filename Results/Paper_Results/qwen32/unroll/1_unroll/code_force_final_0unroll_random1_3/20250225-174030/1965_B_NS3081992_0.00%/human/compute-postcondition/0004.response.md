Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, and they satisfy the conditions 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The current value of `n` is 2, and the current value of `k` is 1. `b` is the binary string representation of `n`, which is "10". `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, which is 2.**
