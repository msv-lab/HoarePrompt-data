To determine the output state, we need to understand the construction of the list `ans` based on the given conditions and then convert it into a space-separated string.

1. **Initial State Recap:**
   - `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, with `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`.
   - `b` is the binary string representation of `n`.
   - `l` is the length of the binary string `b`.
   - `bk` is not explicitly defined, but it can be inferred to be related to `k` in some way, possibly the binary representation of `k`.
   - `lk` is not explicitly defined, but it can be inferred to be related to `l` and `k`, possibly the length of the binary representation of `k`.

2. **Construction of `ans`:**
   - If `k` is 1, `ans` is `[2, 3]` followed by `2`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`, and then the powers of 2 from `2^(lk)` to `2^(l-1)`.

3. **Return Statement:**
   - The return statement converts the list `ans` into a space-separated string.

Given these points, let's construct the output state:

- If `k` is 1, the output will be the string `"2 3 2"`.
- If `k` is not 1, the output will be a more complex string based on the powers of 2 and the specific values of `k`, `l`, and `lk`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the conditions given.

Output State: **The program returns a space-separated string of integers. If `k` is 1, the string is "2 3 2". Otherwise, the string starts with powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then the powers of 2 from `2^(lk)` to `2^(l-1)`.**
