The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k` such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. If `k` is 1, the function returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it returns a space-separated string of integers that starts with powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then the powers of 2 from `2^(lk)` to `2^(l-1)`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
