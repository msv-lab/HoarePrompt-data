### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Encoding Process**:
   - The original string `s` is encoded by first creating an auxiliary string `r` which contains all distinct characters of `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character in `r` is replaced by the last, the second by the second last, and so on).

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - To decode, we need to reverse the encoding process.
   - We identify the auxiliary string `r` by taking the unique characters of the encoded string `b` and sorting them.
   - We create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
   - We then replace each character in `b` using this mapping to reconstruct the original string `s`.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It processes each test case by reading the number of test cases `t`, the length of the encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It generates the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in `b`.
   - It creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - It constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the `mapping`.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function summary describes `func_1` as taking a string `b` and returning a string where each character is replaced by its mirrored counterpart based on a mapping derived from the unique characters in `b`.
- This matches the intended decoding process described in the problem statement.

#### Correctness Check:
- **Generating `r`**: The code correctly generates `r` by taking the unique characters of `b` and sorting them.
- **Creating the Mapping**: The mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character is correctly constructed.
- **Replacing Characters**: The original string `s` is correctly reconstructed by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping.

#### Example Verification:
Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

For the first test case:
- `b = "serofedsoc"`
- `r = "cdefors"`
- Mapping: `c->s`, `d->r`, `e->o`, `f->e`, `o->e`, `r->d`, `s->c`
- Decoding `b` using the mapping results in `s = "codeforces"`.

This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`.

Final: **True**
