Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b` and he wants to cut it into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. Then, he wants to form another rectangle using the two resulting rectangles. If the new rectangle has different dimensions (ignoring rotation), Bob can obtain another rectangle.

### Key Points:
1. If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of equal size along the even dimension.
2. If `a` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles.
3. If `b` is even, he can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles.
4. After cutting, Bob can form a new rectangle by placing the two smaller rectangles side by side or one on top of the other.
5. The new rectangle should have different dimensions compared to the original `a x b` rectangle. For example, if he cuts a `2 x 6` rectangle into two `2 x 3` rectangles, he can form a `4 x 3` rectangle, which is different from `2 x 6`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.
3. It checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
4. If `a` is even, it calculates two `a/2 x b` rectangles and checks if `a/2` is not equal to `b`.
5. If `b` is even, it calculates two `a x b/2` rectangles and checks if `b/2` is not equal to `a`.
6. If either condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Issues in the Program:
The program does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even correctly. Specifically, if both `a` and `b` are even, the program will only check one of the conditions (`a % 2 == 0` or `b % 2 == 0`) and print "Yes" if that condition is met, even if the resulting rectangle has the same dimensions as the original when rotated.

### Correctness:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even correctly. For example, a `4 x 4` rectangle can be cut into two `4 x 2` rectangles, and then these can be rearranged to form a `2 x 8` rectangle, which is different from `4 x 4`. However, the program will print "No" for a `4 x 4` rectangle because it only checks one of the even conditions.

### Corrected Logic:
The correct logic should be:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always form a new rectangle with different dimensions.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even correctly.

Correctness: **False**
