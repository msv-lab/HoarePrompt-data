The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Given that `t` is already defined as the integer value read from the input and is within the range 1 to 10^4, no adjustment to `t` is necessary to ensure the loop executes. The variable `_` does not need to be initialized or adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is the integer value read from the input, 1 <= t <= 10^4**
