### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and check if it correctly solves the problem based on the given problem description.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
3. It checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
4. If `a` is even, it splits `a` into two equal parts `a1` and `a2` (both `a // 2`). If `a1` (or `a2`) is not equal to `b`, it prints "Yes".
5. If `b` is even, it splits `b` into two equal parts `b1` and `b2` (both `b // 2`). If `b1` (or `b2`) is not equal to `a`, it prints "Yes".
6. If neither `a` nor `b` is even, or if the split results in a rectangle that is the same as the original, it prints "No".

The key insight in the problem is that Bob can form a new rectangle if and only if at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle (`a` or `b`) is even. This is because:
- If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles. These two rectangles can be combined to form a `b x a/2` rectangle, which is different from the original `a x b` rectangle unless `a == 2*b` or `b == a/2`.
- Similarly, if `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles. These two rectangles can be combined to form an `a/2 x b` rectangle, which is different from the original `a x b` rectangle unless `b == 2*a` or `a == b/2`.

The program correctly implements this logic. It checks if either dimension is even and, if so, checks if the resulting split dimensions are not identical to the original dimensions, which would mean a new rectangle has been formed.

### Correctness:
The program correctly determines whether Bob can form a new rectangle based on the given conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
