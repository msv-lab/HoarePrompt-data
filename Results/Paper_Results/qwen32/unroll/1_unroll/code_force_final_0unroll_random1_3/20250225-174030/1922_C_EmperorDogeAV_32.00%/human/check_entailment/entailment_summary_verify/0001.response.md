### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as per the description.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities, the number of queries `m`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Finding Closest Cities:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to determine the cost of moving to the closest city for each city.
   - The function iterates through the cities and calculates the distance to the previous and next city.
   - The function assigns `1` if the next city is closer, otherwise, it assigns the distance to the next city. This logic is incorrect because the cost to move to the closest city should always be `1` if the next city is indeed closer.

3. **Correct Logic for `func_1`:**
   - The correct logic for `func_1` should be:
     - If the next city is closer, set `prog_cities[i] = 1`.
     - If the previous city is closer, set `prog_cities[i] = 1`.
     - If the next and previous cities are equidistant, the problem guarantees that this won't happen, so no special handling is needed.
   - The current implementation incorrectly assigns the distance to the next city if it is not closer, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement.

4. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward costs.
   - These prefix sums are used to quickly calculate the total cost of moving from one city to another using the closest city path.
   - Since the costs calculated by `func_1` are incorrect, the prefix sums will also be incorrect.

5. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, the program determines the direction of travel (from `a` to `b` or from `b` to `a`).
   - It then calculates the total cost using the appropriate prefix sums.
   - The logic for processing queries is correct assuming the prefix sums are correct.
   - However, due to the incorrect prefix sums, the final results will be incorrect.

### Issues Summary:

- **Function `func_1` Misinterpretation:**
  - The function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the cost of moving to the closest city. It should always return `1` when moving to the closest city, not the distance to the next city if it is not closer.
- **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
  - The prefix sums are calculated based on the incorrect costs from `func_1`, leading to incorrect results.
- **Query Processing:**
  - The logic for processing queries is correct but relies on the correctness of the prefix sums, which are incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the cost of moving to the closest city, leading to incorrect prefix sums and, consequently, incorrect results for the queries.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
