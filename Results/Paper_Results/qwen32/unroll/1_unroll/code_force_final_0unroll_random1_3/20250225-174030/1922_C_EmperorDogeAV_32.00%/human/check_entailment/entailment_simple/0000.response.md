Let's analyze the given program and determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the minimum cost to travel from one city to another, where the cost depends on whether you travel to the closest city (costing 1 coin) or directly to any other city (costing the distance between the two cities).

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads the queries.

2. **Determine Closest Cities:**
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to determine the closest city for each city. The closest city is either the next city or the previous city, whichever is closer.
   - The function `func_1` calculates the cost to travel to the closest city for each city and returns a list of costs.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the costs to travel to the closest city in both forward and backward directions.
   - `pref_sum_f` is the prefix sum for forward travel, and `pref_sum_b` is the prefix sum for backward travel.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the direction of travel (forward or backward) and calculates the minimum cost using the prefix sums.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` has a bug in the logic for determining the closest city.
   - The function incorrectly calculates the cost to travel to the closest city. It should return `1` if the closest city is the next or previous city, and the distance otherwise. However, the current implementation incorrectly uses `abs(forward - cities[i])` instead of `1` when the closest city is the next or previous city.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sums are calculated based on the incorrect costs returned by `func_1`. This will lead to incorrect results for the queries.

### Correctness

Given the issues in the function `func_1` and the subsequent incorrect prefix sum calculations, the program will not produce the correct results for the queries.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
