Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem as per the description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities, the number of queries `m`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Finding Closest Cities:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to determine the cost of moving to the closest city for each city.
   - It iterates through the cities and calculates the distance to the previous and next city.
   - If the next city is closer, it assigns `1` (cost to move to the closest city), otherwise, it assigns the distance to the next city.
   - This is done twice: once for the forward direction (left to right) and once for the backward direction (right to left).

3. **Calculating Prefix Sums:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward costs.
   - These prefix sums are used to quickly calculate the total cost of moving from one city to another using the closest city path.

4. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, the program determines the direction of travel (from `a` to `b` or from `b` to `a`).
   - It then calculates the total cost using the appropriate prefix sums.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Closest Cities:**
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the cost of moving to the closest city.
   - The condition `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)` is incorrect because it should be checking if the next city is closer than the previous city, but the cost should always be `1` when moving to the closest city.
   - The correct logic should be:
     - If the next city is closer, set `prog_cities[i] = 1`.
     - If the previous city is closer, set `prog_cities[i] = 1`.
     - If the next and previous cities are equidistant, the problem guarantees that this won't happen, so no special handling is needed.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sums are calculated correctly based on the incorrect costs from `func_1`.
   - Since the costs are incorrect, the prefix sums will also be incorrect.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - The logic for processing queries is correct assuming the prefix sums are correct.
   - However, due to the incorrect prefix sums, the final results will be incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the cost of moving to the closest city, leading to incorrect prefix sums and, consequently, incorrect results for the queries.

Correctness: **False**
