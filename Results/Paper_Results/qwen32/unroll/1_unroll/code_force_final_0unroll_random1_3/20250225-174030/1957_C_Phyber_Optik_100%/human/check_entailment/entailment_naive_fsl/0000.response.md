Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program contains several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Initialization of `dp` array and `func_1` function**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized with a size of 300007, but the function `func_1` is called before this array is initialized. This will result in a `NameError` because `dp` is used inside `func_1` before it is defined.
   - The `func_1` function is called with an argument of 300000, but it is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This will result in a `NameError` because `func_1` is not defined.

2. **Incorrect calculation of invalid positions**:
   - The program adds both `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set in each iteration. This is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the computer's move will be at `(c, r)`. The `invalid` set should reflect the positions of all rooks on the board, both white and black.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where `r == c`. In this case, the computer skips its turn, and the `invalid` set should only include `r` (or `c`).

3. **Incorrect use of `dp` array**:
   - The program uses a precomputed `dp` array to determine the number of possible final configurations. However, the `dp` array is not correctly computed, and it does not account for the specific constraints of the problem, such as the positions of the already placed rooks and the mirroring rule.
   - The `dp` array is supposed to store the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board with `k` rooks already placed, but the provided code does not correctly compute this value.

4. **Handling of edge cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as when `k = 0` or when `n` is very large. For example, if `k = 0`, the program should compute the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board without any initial moves, which is not correctly handled by the provided code.

5. **Output format**:
   - The program does not correctly format the output for each test case. It should print the result for each test case on a new line, but the current implementation does not ensure this.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case, and therefore, it is incorrect.
