### Reasoning:

The given Python program aims to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves, given constraints on the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to precompute the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` chessboard.

#### Key Points:
1. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**:
   - The `dp` array is precomputed to store the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` chessboard.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an `i x i` chessboard.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function initializes the `dp` array for values from 1 to `n`.
   - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For `i >= 3`, the recurrence relation used is `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i-2]) % 1000000007`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and identifies the rows and columns that are already occupied.
   - The number of remaining valid positions is `n - len(invalid)`, where `invalid` is a set of rows and columns that are occupied.
   - The result for each test case is `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

#### Issues:
- **Incorrect Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation used in the function `func_1` does not correctly model the problem of placing non-attacking rooks on a chessboard. The correct recurrence relation for this problem is different and more complex.
- **Ignoring Diagonal Moves**: The problem specifies that if a move is made on the diagonal (i.e., `r = c`), the computer skips its turn. This is not accounted for in the current implementation.
- **Precomputation Range**: The precomputation is done up to `300000`, which is correct given the problem constraints, but the recurrence relation itself is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Given the incorrect recurrence relation and the fact that the function `func_1` does not correctly model the problem, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
