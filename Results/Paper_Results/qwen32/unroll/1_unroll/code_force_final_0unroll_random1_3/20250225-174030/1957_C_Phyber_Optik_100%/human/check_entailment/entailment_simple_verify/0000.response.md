Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, the annotations, and the initial assessment to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to determine the number of different final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where you and the computer place rooks alternately according to specific rules. The computer mirrors your move unless \( r = c \), in which case the computer skips its turn. The final configurations are to be counted modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Provided Code Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
The function `func_1` precomputes the number of valid configurations for placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) board using dynamic programming. The recurrence relation used is:
\[ dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7) \]
This relation seems to be derived from combinatorial logic for placing non-attacking rooks, but we need to verify if it correctly accounts for the mirroring rule and the initial \( k \) moves.

#### Main Logic
1. **Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized with a size of 300007, and `func_1` is called to fill this array.
2. **Reading Input**: The number of test cases \( t \) is read, and for each test case, the size of the board \( n \) and the number of initial moves \( k \) are read.
3. **Processing Moves**: For each move, both \( r \) and \( c \) are added to the `invalid` set. This step is incorrect because it does not account for the computer's move, and it incorrectly treats \( r \) and \( c \) as independent invalid positions.
4. **Calculating Result**: The number of possible final configurations is determined using `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

### Annotations
The annotations confirm that the `dp` array is correctly computed using the provided recurrence relation, but they do not address the issues with the `invalid` set and the handling of the initial moves.

### Issues Identified
1. **Initialization and Function Definition**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized before `func_1` is defined, which would cause a `NameError`. However, the annotations suggest that `func_1` is correctly defined and called, so this issue might be a typo in the code snippet provided.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Invalid Positions**:
   - The `invalid` set is incorrectly updated by adding both \( r \) and \( c \) without considering the computer's move. This leads to incorrect counting of invalid positions.
   - The mirroring rule is not correctly applied, especially when \( r = c \).

3. **Incorrect Use of `dp` Array**:
   - The `dp` array is supposed to store the number of ways to place rooks on an \( n \times n \) board with \( k \) rooks already placed, but the current implementation does not correctly adjust for the initial moves and the mirroring rule.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as when \( k = 0 \) or when \( n \) is very large.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program correctly prints the result for each test case on a new line.

### Conclusion
Given the identified issues, particularly the incorrect handling of the initial moves and the mirroring rule, the program does not correctly implement the problem description. The `dp` array, while correctly computed for a base case, is not adjusted for the specific constraints of the problem.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
