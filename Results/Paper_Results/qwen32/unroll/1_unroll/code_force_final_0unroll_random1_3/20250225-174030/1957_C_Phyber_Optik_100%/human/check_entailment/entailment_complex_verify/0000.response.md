Let's carefully analyze the provided code, annotations, and the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires calculating the number of different final configurations of the chessboard after a series of moves, considering the mirroring rule and ensuring no two rooks attack each other.

### Code Analysis

1. **Initialization and Precomputation**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized with a size of 300007 and then filled using the `func_1` function, which is defined to compute the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` chessboard.
   - The `dp` array is computed using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i-2]) \mod 1000000007
     \]
   - This formula seems to be correct for the problem of counting non-attacking rook placements, although the problem description does not explicitly provide this formula. However, it is a known result in combinatorics for this specific problem.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads `k` moves and adds both `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set. This is incorrect because the computer's move will be at `(c, r)`, and both positions should be marked as invalid.
   - The program then calculates the number of valid configurations as `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which is incorrect because it does not account for the specific positions of the rooks and the mirroring rule properly.

3. **Handling of Mirroring Rule**:
   - The mirroring rule is not correctly implemented. The program does not differentiate between the positions of the rooks placed by the player and the computer, and it does not skip the computer's turn when `r == c`.

### Annotations

The annotations confirm the behavior of the code:
- The `dp` array is correctly computed using the provided formula.
- The `invalid` set is incorrectly updated, as it adds both `r` and `c` without considering the mirroring rule.

### Original Assessment

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues:
1. **Initialization of `dp` array and `func_1` function**:
   - The `func_1` function is called before the `dp` array is initialized, which would result in a `NameError`. However, in the provided code, `dp` is initialized before `func_1` is called, so this issue does not exist in the code as provided.
   - The `func_1` function is correctly defined and called.

2. **Incorrect calculation of invalid positions**:
   - The program does not correctly update the `invalid` set to account for the mirroring rule.

3. **Incorrect use of `dp` array**:
   - The `dp` array is correctly computed, but it is not used correctly to account for the specific constraints of the problem.

4. **Handling of edge cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as when `k = 0` or when `n` is very large.

5. **Output format**:
   - The program correctly formats the output for each test case.

### Conclusion

The program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. The main issue is the incorrect updating of the `invalid` set, which does not account for the mirroring rule and the specific positions of the rooks.

**Final: False**
