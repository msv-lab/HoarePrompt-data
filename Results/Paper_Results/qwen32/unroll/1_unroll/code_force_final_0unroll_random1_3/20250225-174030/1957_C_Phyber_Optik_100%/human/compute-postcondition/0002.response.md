The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop will start with `i` equal to 3 and will iterate as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 3, because if `n` is less than 3, the range `(3, n + 1)` will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

The states of `k`, `dp[1]`, and `dp[2]` are not in the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `n` is at least 3.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the size of the chessboard (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and must be at least 3, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of moves already played (0 ≤ k ≤ n), `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**
