#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the size of the chessboard (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), and k is a non-negative integer representing the number of moves already played (0 ≤ k ≤ n). The function is called once for each test case, and for each test case, there are k lines of input, each containing two integers r_i and c_i (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n) representing the i-th move made. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the size of the chessboard (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of moves already played (0 ≤ k ≤ n), `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for i from 3 to n is computed as (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i-2]) % 1000000007.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the size of the chessboard. It calculates and returns a value based on a dynamic programming approach, specifically the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` chessboard modulo 1000000007. The function does not consider any moves `k` or their positions as described in the annotations, as these are not part of the function's actual implementation.
