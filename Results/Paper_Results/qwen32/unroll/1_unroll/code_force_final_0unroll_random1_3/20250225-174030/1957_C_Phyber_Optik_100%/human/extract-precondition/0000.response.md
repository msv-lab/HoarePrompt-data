Precondition: **n is an integer representing the size of the chessboard (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), and k is a non-negative integer representing the number of moves already played (0 ≤ k ≤ n). The function is called once for each test case, and for each test case, there are k lines of input, each containing two integers r_i and c_i (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n) representing the i-th move made. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
