### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine if a given subarray can be split into parts with equal bitwise XOR values. The program uses prefix XOR values and binary search to efficiently answer the queries.

Here's a breakdown of the approach:
1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix XOR for the array up to each index. This allows for quick computation of the XOR for any subarray.
2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**: It uses a dictionary to map each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this value occurs. This helps in efficiently finding subarrays with the same XOR value.
3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray using the prefix XOR values. If the XOR is zero, it directly returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it uses binary search to find if there are two indices within the range that have the same prefix XOR value, indicating that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly calculates the prefix XOR values.
- It uses the dictionary to store and efficiently look up the indices of these prefix XOR values.
- For each query, it correctly checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero.
- If the XOR is not zero, it uses binary search to find if there are indices within the range that have the same prefix XOR value, which would mean the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the given conditions. The execution summary confirms that it processes the queries correctly, and the output matches the expected results for the provided examples.

**Correctness: True**
