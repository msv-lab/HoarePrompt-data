You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and q, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5. This is followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30. Then, q lines follow, each containing two integers l and r, where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, representing the subarray a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r to be queried. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        q = int(data[idx + 1])
        
        idx += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        mp = {(0): [0]}
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            if pf[i] not in mp:
                mp[pf[i]] = []
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[idx])
            r = int(data[idx + 1])
            idx += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
            v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
            it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
        results.append('')
        
    #State: data is a list of strings representing the input values split by spaces (fully traversed); idx is the position after the last element used in the loop; t is the integer value of data[0]; results is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query, with an empty string after each test case's results.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: 'YES' or 'NO' on each line, followed by an empty line after each test case's results
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of a list of integers, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` follows, with each integer being between 0 and \(2^{30}\). For each of the `q` queries, the function receives two integers `l` and `r` representing a subarray `a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r`. The function returns the sum of the integers in each queried subarray.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
