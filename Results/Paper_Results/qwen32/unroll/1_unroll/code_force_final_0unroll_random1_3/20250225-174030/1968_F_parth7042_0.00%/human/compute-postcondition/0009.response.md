Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if there exists a subarray within the specified range whose XOR is zero. The function outputs 'YES' if such a subarray exists and 'NO' otherwise, followed by an empty line after each test case's results.**
