You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine whether a subarray can be divided into more than one segment such that the bitwise XOR of each segment is equal. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an array and a set of queries. For each query, the program should output "YES" if the subarray can be divided as described, otherwise "NO".

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the `i-th` element. It also uses a dictionary `mp` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value appears.

For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` as `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`. If `x` is zero, it means the subarray can be trivially divided into any number of segments with XOR zero. Otherwise, it checks if there are indices in the prefix XOR array that can divide the subarray into segments with equal XOR.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program should handle cases where the subarray itself has a XOR of zero, which is correctly handled by the code.
2. **Checking for Valid Segments**: The program uses binary search to find valid segment divisions, which is a good approach. However, it needs to ensure that it correctly identifies valid segment divisions.
3. **Efficiency**: The program uses prefix XOR and binary search, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with a few cases to ensure it works as expected.

#### Test Case 1:
```
4
5 5
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
3 4
```
Expected Output:
```
YES
YES
NO
NO
NO
```
The program correctly handles this case.

#### Test Case 2:
```
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
2 3
```
Expected Output:
```
YES
NO
NO
NO
NO
```
The program correctly handles this case.

#### Test Case 3:
```
7 4
12 9 10 9 10 11 9
1 5
1 7
2 6
2 7
```
Expected Output:
```
NO
NO
NO
NO
```
The program correctly handles this case.

#### Test Case 4:
```
11 4
0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 2
2 5
6 9
7 11
```
Expected Output:
```
YES
NO
YES
YES
```
The program correctly handles this case.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and testing, the program appears to correctly handle all provided test cases and edge cases. It efficiently uses prefix XOR and binary search to determine if a subarray can be divided into segments with equal XOR.

Correctness: **True**.

### Explanation:
The program correctly calculates the prefix XOR for the array and uses a dictionary to store the indices of each prefix XOR value. For each query, it checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero or if there are valid segment divisions using binary search. The program handles all edge cases and efficiently processes the input within the given constraints.
