Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
Given integers `n` and `k`, we need to find a permutation `p` of length `n` such that its Manhattan value equals `k`. The Manhattan value is defined as:
\[ \text{Manhattan value} = |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \]

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It checks if `k` is odd. If so, it returns `(0, 0)` because an odd Manhattan value is impossible for a permutation.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`). The formula used is incorrect. The correct formula should be:
     \[ \text{max\_k} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \]
   - The current formula used in `func_2` is:
     \[ \text{max\_k} = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \text{ if } n \text{ is odd, otherwise } \frac{n^2}{2} \]
   - This formula is incorrect and can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function attempts to construct a permutation with the given Manhattan value `k`.
   - The logic in this function is complex and not well-documented. However, the key issue is that the function assumes that `k` is even and uses a flawed approach to construct the permutation.
   - The function modifies the list `l` by moving elements based on the value of `k`. However, the logic for determining how to move elements and the conditions under which to stop are flawed.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function prints the permutation if a valid one is found.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the permutation.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_2` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0 (which happens when `k` is odd or greater than `max_k`), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to get the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print it.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Calculation of `max_k`**: The formula used in `func_2` is incorrect, leading to incorrect determination of whether a valid permutation exists.
- **Flawed Permutation Construction**: The logic in `func_1` is incorrect, and it does not guarantee that the constructed permutation will have the desired Manhattan value `k`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem description. The incorrect calculation of `max_k` and the flawed logic in `func_1` are significant problems that prevent the program from being correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program contains logical errors that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all valid inputs.
