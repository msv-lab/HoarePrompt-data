You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

    return results
    #The program returns `results`, which is a list of `t` integers where each integer is the smallest year that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding test case's list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `test_cases` containing `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list of `t` integers, where each integer is the smallest year that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding test case's list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes each test case by iterating through the list of periodicities (`a`) and calculates the year in which each sign will occur sequentially. The logic for determining the next occurrence of each sign is accurate. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `current_year` to 0, which represents the starting year.
2. **Iteration through signs**: For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`:
   - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign will be in `current_year + ai`.
   - If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign will be in the next multiple of `ai`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
3. **Updating current_year**: After determining the next occurrence of the sign, it updates `current_year` to `next_year`.
4. **Storing results**: After processing all signs in a test case, it appends the final `current_year` (which represents the year of the n-th sign occurrence) to the results list.
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The code handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem statement, such as when all periodicities are 1, or when the periodicities are larger numbers. The logic ensures that the signs occur sequentially as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
