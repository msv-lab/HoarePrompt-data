Output State: **The program returns `results`, which is a list of `t` integers where each integer is the smallest year that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding test case's list.**

This means that for each test case, the program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers provided in that test case and stores it in the `results` list. The final output is the `results` list containing these LCM values for all test cases.
