### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and verifies it using an example from the problem statement. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, and the function summary to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The Chaya tribe believes in `n` signs of the apocalypse.
- Each `i-th` sign occurs every `a_i` years.
- The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the `i+1`-th sign can only occur after the `i-th` sign has occurred.
- We need to determine the year in which the `n-th` sign occurs.

#### Program Code Recap:
- The program reads `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and the list `a` of periodicities.
- It calculates the year in which the `n-th` sign occurs by iterating through each sign's periodicity and determining the next occurrence year based on the current year.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1` takes `t` test cases and returns a list of years in which the `n-th` sign occurs for each test case.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `current_year` is initialized to 0, representing the starting year.
   
2. **Iteration through Signs**:
   - For each sign `ai` in the list of periodicities:
     - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next sign will occur exactly `ai` years later.
     - If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next sign will occur in the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`.
     - `current_year` is updated to `next_year` for the next iteration.

3. **Result Collection**:
   - After processing all signs in a test case, the final `current_year` (which is the year the `n-th` sign occurs) is appended to the results list.

4. **Output**:
   - The results for all test cases are printed.

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the first test case from the example:
- Input: `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
- Calculation:
  - Start at `current_year = 0`.
  - First sign: `current_year = 3` (next multiple of 3 after 0).
  - Second sign: `current_year = 4` (next multiple of 2 after 3).
  - Third sign: `current_year = 8` (next multiple of 4 after 4).
  - Fourth sign: `current_year = 10` (next multiple of 5 after 8).
  - Fifth sign: `current_year = 18` (next multiple of 9 after 10).
  - Sixth sign: `current_year = 36` (next multiple of 18 after 18).
- Output: `36`, which matches the expected result.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the `n-th` sign occurs for each test case. The step-by-step reasoning and verification with the example provided in the original assessment align with the problem requirements and the program's behavior.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
