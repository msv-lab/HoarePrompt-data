### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description:
The problem involves determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse occurs, given that each sign appears every `a_i` years and must occur sequentially. Specifically, if a sign occurs in year `x`, the next sign must occur in a year `y` such that `x < y` and `y` is a multiple of the next sign's periodicity.

#### Program Code Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_i`. It calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs by iterating through each sign's periodicity and calculating the next occurrence year as follows:
- If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next sign will occur exactly `ai` years later (`next_year = current_year + ai`).
- If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next sign will occur in the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year` (`next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai`).
- The `current_year` is then updated to `next_year` for the next iteration.

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the first test case from the example:
- Input: `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
- Calculation:
  - Start at `current_year = 0`.
  - First sign: `current_year = 3` (next multiple of 3 after 0).
  - Second sign: `current_year = 4` (next multiple of 2 after 3).
  - Third sign: `current_year = 8` (next multiple of 4 after 4).
  - Fourth sign: `current_year = 10` (next multiple of 5 after 8).
  - Fifth sign: `current_year = 18` (next multiple of 9 after 10).
  - Sixth sign: `current_year = 36` (next multiple of 18 after 18).
- Output: `36`, which matches the expected result.

#### Annotated Code:
The annotations confirm that the program correctly initializes `current_year` to 0 and iterates through each sign's periodicity to calculate the next occurrence year. The annotations also confirm that the final `current_year` is the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case. The annotations provide a clear and accurate description of the program's behavior, and the example verification confirms the correctness of the implementation.

**Final: True**
