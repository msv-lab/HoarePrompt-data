### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly analyzes the problem and the program's logic. Let's break down the program and the annotations to ensure everything aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `current_year` is initialized to 0, which is correct because the counting of years starts from the year 0.

2. **Iteration through Signs**:
   - For each sign's periodicity `ai`, the program checks if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`:
     - If `current_year % ai == 0`, the next occurrence of the sign is `current_year + ai`.
     - If `current_year % ai != 0`, the next occurrence of the sign is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - This logic correctly ensures that the signs occur in sequence and strictly after the previous sign.

3. **Result Collection**:
   - After processing all signs in a test case, the final `current_year` is the year in which the n-th sign occurs and is appended to the results list.

4. **Output**:
   - The results for all test cases are printed correctly.

### Verification with Example:
The example provided in the problem statement is verified step-by-step in the original assessment, and the output matches the expected result. Let's re-check the first test case:

- **Input**: `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
- **Calculation**:
  - Start at `current_year = 0`.
  - First sign: `current_year = 3` (next multiple of 3 after 0).
  - Second sign: `current_year = 4` (next multiple of 2 after 3).
  - Third sign: `current_year = 8` (next multiple of 4 after 4).
  - Fourth sign: `current_year = 10` (next multiple of 5 after 8).
  - Fifth sign: `current_year = 18` (next multiple of 9 after 10).
  - Sixth sign: `current_year = 36` (next multiple of 18 after 18).
- **Output**: `36`, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case. The annotations and the step-by-step reasoning provided in the original assessment are accurate.

**Final: True**
