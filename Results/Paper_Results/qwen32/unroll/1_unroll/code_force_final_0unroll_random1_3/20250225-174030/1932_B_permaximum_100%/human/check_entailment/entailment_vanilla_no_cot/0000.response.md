Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over each test case, calculates the year in which each sign will occur sequentially, and then outputs the year in which the last (n-th) sign occurs, triggering the apocalypse. The logic for determining the next occurrence of each sign is accurately implemented, and the program handles multiple test cases as required.
