You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given that each sign appears every `a_i` years and must occur sequentially. The sequence of signs must strictly follow the order provided.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_i`. It then calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs by iterating through each sign's periodicity and calculating the next occurrence year.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `current_year` to 0, which represents the starting year.
2. **Iteration through Signs**: For each sign `ai` in the list of periodicities:
   - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next sign will occur exactly `ai` years later, so `next_year` is set to `current_year + ai`.
   - If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next sign will occur in the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`. This is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - The `current_year` is then updated to `next_year` for the next iteration.
3. **Result Collection**: After processing all signs in a test case, the final `current_year` (which is the year the n-th sign occurs) is appended to the results list.
4. **Output**: The results for all test cases are printed.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the first test case from the example:
- Input: `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
- Calculation:
  - Start at `current_year = 0`.
  - First sign: `current_year = 3` (next multiple of 3 after 0).
  - Second sign: `current_year = 4` (next multiple of 2 after 3).
  - Third sign: `current_year = 8` (next multiple of 4 after 4).
  - Fourth sign: `current_year = 10` (next multiple of 5 after 8).
  - Fifth sign: `current_year = 18` (next multiple of 9 after 10).
  - Sixth sign: `current_year = 36` (next multiple of 18 after 18).
- Output: `36`, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case.
