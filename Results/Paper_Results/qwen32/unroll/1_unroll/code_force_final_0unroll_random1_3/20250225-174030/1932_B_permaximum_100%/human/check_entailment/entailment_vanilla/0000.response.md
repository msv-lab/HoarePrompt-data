Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` signs, each occurring periodically every `a_i` years.
- The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the `i-th` sign must occur after the `(i-1)-th` sign.
- We need to determine the year in which the `n-th` sign will occur.

### Program Analysis:
The program is structured as follows:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of signs) and a list of `n` integers `a` (the periodicities of the signs).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - It then iterates through each sign's periodicity `ai`.
     - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign will be `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, the next occurrence of the sign will be the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - `current_year` is updated to the year of the next occurrence of the sign.
   - After processing all signs, `current_year` will be the year when the `n-th` sign occurs.

3. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the year for each test case.

### Verification:
Let's verify the logic with the provided example:

- **First Test Case:**
  - `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - `current_year` starts at 0.
  - First sign: `current_year = 3`
  - Second sign: `current_year = 4`
  - Third sign: `current_year = 8`
  - Fourth sign: `current_year = 10`
  - Fifth sign: `current_year = 18`
  - Sixth sign: `current_year = 36`
  - Output: `36` (correct)

- **Second Test Case:**
  - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - `current_year` starts at 0.
  - First sign: `current_year = 1`
  - Second sign: `current_year = 2`
  - Third sign: `current_year = 3`
  - Fourth sign: `current_year = 4`
  - Fifth sign: `current_year = 5`
  - Output: `5` (correct)

- **Third Test Case:**
  - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - `current_year` starts at 0.
  - All signs occur in consecutive years.
  - Output: `5` (correct)

- **Fourth Test Case:**
  - `n = 6`, `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - `current_year` starts at 0.
  - First sign: `current_year = 50`
  - Second sign: `current_year = 60`
  - Third sign: `current_year = 761`
  - Fourth sign: `current_year = 961`
  - Fifth sign: `current_year = 1464`
  - Sixth sign: `current_year = 2012`
  - Output: `2012` (correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the year in which the `n-th` sign occurs for each test case based on the given problem description.

**Correctness: True**
