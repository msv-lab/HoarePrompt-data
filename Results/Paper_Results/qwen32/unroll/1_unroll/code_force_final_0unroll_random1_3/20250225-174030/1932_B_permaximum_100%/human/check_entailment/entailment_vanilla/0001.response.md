Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given that each sign appears every `a_i` years and must occur sequentially. The sequence of signs must strictly follow the order provided.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_i`. It then calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs by iterating through each sign's periodicity and calculating the next occurrence year.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `current_year` to 0, which represents the starting year.
2. **Iteration through Signs**: For each sign `ai` in the list of periodicities:
   - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next sign will occur exactly `ai` years later, so `next_year` is set to `current_year + ai`.
   - If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next sign will occur in the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`. This is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - The `current_year` is then updated to `next_year` for the next iteration.
3. **Result Collection**: After processing all signs in a test case, the final `current_year` (which is the year the n-th sign occurs) is appended to the results list.
4. **Output**: The results for all test cases are printed.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the first test case from the example:
- Input: `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
- Calculation:
  - Start at `current_year = 0`.
  - First sign: `current_year = 3` (next multiple of 3 after 0).
  - Second sign: `current_year = 4` (next multiple of 2 after 3).
  - Third sign: `current_year = 8` (next multiple of 4 after 4).
  - Fourth sign: `current_year = 10` (next multiple of 5 after 8).
  - Fifth sign: `current_year = 18` (next multiple of 9 after 10).
  - Sixth sign: `current_year = 36` (next multiple of 18 after 18).
- Output: `36`, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
