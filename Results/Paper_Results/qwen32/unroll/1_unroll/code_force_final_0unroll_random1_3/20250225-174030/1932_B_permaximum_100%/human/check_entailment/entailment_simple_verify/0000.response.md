### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the code and the annotations to verify the correctness of the program.

1. **Initialization**: The `current_year` is initialized to 0 for each test case, which is correct as we start counting from year 0.

2. **Iteration through signs**: For each periodicity `ai`:
   - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign will indeed be in `current_year + ai`.
   - If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign will be in the next multiple of `ai`, which is correctly calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

3. **Updating `current_year`**: After determining the next occurrence of the sign, `current_year` is updated to `next_year`. This ensures that the next sign is considered starting from the year immediately after the previous sign's occurrence.

4. **Storing results**: After processing all signs in a test case, the final `current_year` (which represents the year of the n-th sign occurrence) is appended to the results list.

5. **Output**: The program prints the results for all test cases, which is correct.

The annotations provided are consistent with the code and correctly describe the state of the program at key points. The logic implemented in the program aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires the signs to occur sequentially, starting from year 0 and considering the periodicity of each sign.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
