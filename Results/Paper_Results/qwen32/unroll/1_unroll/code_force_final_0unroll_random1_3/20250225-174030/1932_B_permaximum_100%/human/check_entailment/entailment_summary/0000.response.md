Reasoning:
The provided program is designed to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur based on the periodicity of each sign. The algorithm iterates through each sign's periodicity, calculating the year in which each subsequent sign will occur after the previous one. The logic is as follows:

1. For each test case, the program initializes `current_year` to 0.
2. It then iterates over each periodicity `ai` in the list of periodicities for the test case.
3. If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign will be `current_year + ai`.
4. If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence of the sign will be the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`, which is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
5. It updates `current_year` to `next_year` after calculating the next occurrence of each sign.
6. This process continues until all signs have been considered, and the final `current_year` is the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

The execution summary provided seems to be slightly misinterpreted. It suggests that the function returns the smallest year that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding test case's list, which is not the task at hand. Instead, the function correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur sequentially based on the rules provided in the problem description.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected output for the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
