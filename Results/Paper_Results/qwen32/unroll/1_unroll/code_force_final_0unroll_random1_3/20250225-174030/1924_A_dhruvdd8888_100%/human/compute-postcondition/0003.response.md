Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, where 1 <= `n` <= 26, 1 <= `k` <= 26, and 1 <= `m` <= 1000; the string `s` is now the string read from the input, and it contains only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; the sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases do not exceed 10^6; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set.**

The variable `win` is initialized as an empty set, while all other variables retain their initial values as described.
