The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provided (`ps` is less than `n`) does not affect the output of this specific `print` statement since the string `'NO'` is hardcoded and does not depend on the values of `ps` or `n`.

Therefore, the output will be exactly the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
