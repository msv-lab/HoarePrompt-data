In the given task, the `while` loop condition is `t > 0`. This means that for the loop to execute at least once, the variable `t` must be greater than 0. 

From the problem statement, we know that `t` is an integer read from input such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`. This already satisfies the condition `t > 0` because the smallest possible value for `t` is 1.

Since `t` is guaranteed to be greater than 0 based on the problem constraints, no adjustments are needed to ensure that the loop can execute the first time.

Thus, the state right before the loop can remain as it is.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9. Additionally, `m` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= m_i <= 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
