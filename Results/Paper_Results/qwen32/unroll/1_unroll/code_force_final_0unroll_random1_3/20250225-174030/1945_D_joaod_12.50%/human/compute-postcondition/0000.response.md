The code snippet `cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as the input only affects the variable `cases`.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200,000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
