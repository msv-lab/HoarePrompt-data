### Reasoning:

The goal is to determine the maximum balance (GCD) of the difficulties of `n` sub-problems such that their sum equals `x`. The provided program attempts to find this by iterating through possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.

The logic can be broken down as follows:
1. For each test case, read `x` and `n`.
2. Initialize `ans` to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD.
3. Iterate through all numbers `i` from 1 up to the square root of `x`.
   - If `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), check if it is possible to split `x` into `n` parts, each of which is a multiple of `i`. This is checked by ensuring `(x - n * i) >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`. If true, update `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
   - Similarly, check for the divisor `x // i` (the corresponding larger divisor pair).
4. Print the maximum `ans` found for each test case.

The key idea here is to find the largest possible GCD `g` such that `x` can be split into `n` parts, each of which is a multiple of `g`. This is achieved by checking all divisors of `x` and verifying if they can be used to form the required partition.

The program correctly checks all possible divisors and ensures that the sum of the sub-problems equals `x` while maintaining the condition that each sub-problem's difficulty is a multiple of the GCD. The use of the square root optimization ensures that the program runs efficiently even for large values of `x`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance (GCD) for the given problem constraints. It efficiently checks all possible divisors of `x` and ensures that the conditions for the sub-problems are met.
