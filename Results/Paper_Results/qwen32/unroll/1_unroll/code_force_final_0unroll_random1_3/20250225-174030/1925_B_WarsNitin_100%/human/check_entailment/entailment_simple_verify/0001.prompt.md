You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The goal is to determine the maximum balance (GCD) of the difficulties of `n` sub-problems such that their sum equals `x`. The provided program attempts to find this by iterating through possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.

The logic can be broken down as follows:
1. For each test case, read `x` and `n`.
2. Initialize `ans` to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD.
3. Iterate through all numbers `i` from 1 up to the square root of `x`.
   - If `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), check if it is possible to split `x` into `n` parts, each of which is a multiple of `i`. This is checked by ensuring `(x - n * i) >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`. If true, update `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
   - Similarly, check for the divisor `x // i` (the corresponding larger divisor pair).
4. Print the maximum `ans` found for each test case.

The key idea here is to find the largest possible GCD `g` such that `x` can be split into `n` parts, each of which is a multiple of `g`. This is achieved by checking all divisors of `x` and verifying if they can be used to form the required partition.

The program correctly checks all possible divisors and ensures that the sum of the sub-problems equals `x` while maintaining the condition that each sub-problem's difficulty is a multiple of the GCD. The use of the square root optimization ensures that the program runs efficiently even for large values of `x`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance (GCD) for the given problem constraints. It efficiently checks all possible divisors of `x` and ensures that the conditions for the sub-problems are met.
