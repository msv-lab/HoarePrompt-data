Output State: **`n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, and `coef` is a list of `n` None values; `tot` is 0; `bipartite` is True.**

In this output state, the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, and `tot` retain their initial values. The new variable `bipartite` is introduced and set to `True`.
