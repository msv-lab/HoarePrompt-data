You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Program:

- Function Summary: 
The function takes a list of strings `s`, where each string consists of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a string containing all unique characters from the concatenated strings in `s`, ordered in reverse of their first appearance.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string. The main issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function. The function is supposed to map each character in the encoded string back to its original character using the symmetric character from the sorted list of unique characters. However, the current implementation incorrectly modifies the string `s` while iterating over it, which leads to incorrect mappings.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Mapping Logic**: The function attempts to replace characters in the string `s` directly while iterating over it. This can lead to incorrect mappings because the string `s` is being modified during iteration, which affects subsequent iterations.

2. **Unnecessary Insertion in Unique Characters**: The code attempts to insert characters into the `unique_chars` list if they are not found, which is not necessary for decoding. The `unique_chars` list should only contain the distinct characters from the encoded string, sorted in alphabetical order.

3. **Incorrect Symmetric Character Replacement**: The function does not correctly map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric character from the `unique_chars` list. Instead, it attempts to replace characters in the string `s` directly, which leads to incorrect results.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    return ''.join(char_map[char] for char in s)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)
```

In this corrected version:
- We create a dictionary `char_map` that maps each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric character.
- We then use this dictionary to decode the encoded string `s` by replacing each character with its mapped value.

This corrected version should work correctly for all test cases as per the problem description.
