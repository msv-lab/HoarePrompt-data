You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        score = 0
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        print(score)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), indicating that there are 2n integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), which are the numbers written on the whiteboard.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
        score = 0
        
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        
        print(score)
        
    #State: For each test case, the sum of every second element from the sorted list of 2n integers.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always pairing the smallest available numbers together. Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list of integers in ascending order. This ensures that when we pair numbers, we are always adding the smallest available number to the score, which is optimal to maximize the score.

2. **Iterating Through the List**: The program iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2. This means it pairs the smallest number with the next smallest number, the third smallest with the fourth smallest, and so on.

3. **Adding to the Score**: For each pair, the program adds the first number of the pair (which is the smaller one due to sorting) to the score. This is because the problem specifies adding `min(x, y)` to the score, and in a sorted list, the first number of each pair is always the minimum of the two.

4. **Output**: After processing all pairs for a test case, the program prints the total score.

The program handles all edge cases as well:
- **Single Pair**: If there's only one pair (n=1), it correctly adds the smaller of the two numbers to the score.
- **Multiple Pairs**: For multiple pairs, it consistently pairs the smallest numbers, ensuring the score is maximized.
- **All Numbers Equal**: If all numbers are equal, the score will simply be `n` times the value of any number, which is correct.
- **Various Inputs**: The program can handle different sets of numbers, including those with repeated values and those with a wide range of values.

Given these points, the program adheres to the problem description and should work correctly for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
