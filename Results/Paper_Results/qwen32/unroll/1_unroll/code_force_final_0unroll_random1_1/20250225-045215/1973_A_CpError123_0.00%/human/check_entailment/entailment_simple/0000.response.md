### Reasoning:

The program is intended to calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on the scores of three players. Let's break down the logic and verify if it works correctly:

1. **Total Points Check:**
   - The total points should be even because each game awards a total of 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1).
   - If the total points are odd, it's impossible to achieve these scores with valid games, so the function correctly returns `-1`.

2. **Total Matches Calculation:**
   - The total number of matches is half the total points because each match contributes 2 points.
   - If the total number of matches exceeds 3 (the maximum possible matches among 3 players), or if the highest score `p3` is greater than the total number of matches, it's impossible to achieve these scores, so the function correctly returns `-1`.

3. **Calculating Draws:**
   - The formula for calculating the maximum number of draws is `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula tries to account for the points that must have come from wins and then calculates the remaining points that could have come from draws.
   - If the calculated number of draws is negative, itâ€™s impossible to achieve the given scores, so the function correctly returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the number of draws is half the remaining points (since each draw contributes 2 points).

### Verification with Examples:

Let's verify the program with the given examples:

1. **Input:** `(0, 0, 0)`
   - Total points = 0, which is even.
   - Total matches = 0.
   - Draws = 0.
   - **Output:** `0` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `(0, 1, 1)`
   - Total points = 2, which is even.
   - Total matches = 1.
   - Draws = 1.
   - **Output:** `1` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `(1, 1, 1)`
   - Total points = 3, which is odd.
   - **Output:** `-1` (Correct)

4. **Input:** `(1, 1, 2)`
   - Total points = 4, which is even.
   - Total matches = 2.
   - Draws = 2.
   - **Output:** `2` (Correct)

5. **Input:** `(3, 3, 3)`
   - Total points = 9, which is odd.
   - **Output:** `-1` (Correct)

6. **Input:** `(3, 4, 5)`
   - Total points = 12, which is even.
   - Total matches = 6.
   - Draws = 6.
   - **Output:** `6` (Correct)

7. **Input:** `(1, 1, 10)`
   - Total points = 12, which is even.
   - Total matches = 6.
   - Draws = 2.
   - **Output:** `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the provided examples and follows the logic described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
