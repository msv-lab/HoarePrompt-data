You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)

            resultats.append(-1)
        else:

resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and cas_de_test is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. Each tuple represents the scores of the three players for a single test case.

    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3

        else:

    #State: resultats is a list of integers calculated based on the conditions described, t is unchanged, and cas_de_test is unchanged.
    return resultats
    #The program returns the list 'resultats' which contains integers calculated based on the conditions described.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Let's analyze the code and identify some potential cases where it fails.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Matches**: The code calculates `total_matchs` as `total_points // 2`, which is correct. However, it then checks if `total_matchs > 3` which is incorrect. The maximum number of matches is not restricted to 3, as the problem does not specify a limit on the number of games played.

2. **Incorrect Check for Valid Scores**: The code checks if `p3 > total_matchs`, which is incorrect. The score `p3` can be greater than `total_matchs` if there are draws. The correct check should be based on the feasibility of the scores, not just this simple comparison.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Draws**: The formula for calculating `egalites` (draws) is incorrect. The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` does not correctly account for the distribution of wins and draws. It does not ensure that the calculated number of draws is feasible given the scores.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not handle some edge cases correctly. For example, when `p1 == p2 == p3`, the maximum number of draws should be calculated differently.

### Example of Failure:
Let's consider the test case `(1, 1, 2)`. According to the problem description, the maximum number of draws is 2. However, the provided code calculates it as 0.

Here is how the code executes for this test case:
- `total_points = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`
- `total_matchs = 4 // 2 = 2`
- `egalites = 4 - 2 * (2 - 1) - 2 * (2 - 1) = 4 - 2 - 2 = 0`

Thus, the code incorrectly returns 0 instead of 2 for this test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.
