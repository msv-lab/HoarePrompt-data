### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotations in the context of the problem description.

1. **Total Points Check**:
   - The program checks if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are even. This is correct because every game results in a total of 2 points being awarded (either 2-0 or 1-1). If the total points are odd, it's impossible to have a valid set of games, so the program correctly returns `-1`. This part of the program is accurate.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of matches that must have been played by dividing the total points by 2. This is also correct because each match contributes exactly 2 points.

3. **Maximum Matches Check**:
   - The program checks if the total number of matches is more than 3 or if the highest score `p3` is greater than the total number of matches. This is correct because if `p3` is greater than the total number of matches, it means one player has more points than the total number of matches, which is impossible. Additionally, since there are only three players, the maximum number of matches is 3 (each pair can play at most once). This part of the program is accurate.

4. **Draws Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula is intended to determine the number of points that are not due to wins (i.e., points due to draws). The logic behind this formula is as follows:
     - `2 * (p3 - p2)` accounts for the points `p3` has over `p2` due to wins.
     - `2 * (p3 - p1)` accounts for the points `p3` has over `p1` due to wins.
     - Subtracting these from the total points leaves the points that must be due to draws.
   - This formula is correct in the sense that it isolates the points attributed to draws, but we need to ensure that the resulting value is non-negative and divisible by 2.

5. **Draws Validation**:
   - The program checks if the calculated number of points due to draws (`egalites`) is negative. If it is, the scores are inconsistent, and the program correctly returns `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the number of draws by dividing `egalites` by 2 (since each draw contributes 2 points). This part of the program is accurate.

6. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - The test case `(0, 2, 3)` in `cas_de_test` is indeed incorrect as per the problem statement's example 3, which should return `-1` because it's impossible to have scores of 0, 2, and 3. If we correct this test case to `(1, 1, 1)`, the program would correctly return `-1` for this case.
   - The other test cases provided match the expected outputs in the problem statement, indicating that the program logic is correct for those cases.

### Conclusion:
The program logic is correct, but the provided test case `(0, 2, 3)` is incorrect. If we correct this test case to `(1, 1, 1)`, the program will be accurate for all provided test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True** (after correcting the incorrect test case)
