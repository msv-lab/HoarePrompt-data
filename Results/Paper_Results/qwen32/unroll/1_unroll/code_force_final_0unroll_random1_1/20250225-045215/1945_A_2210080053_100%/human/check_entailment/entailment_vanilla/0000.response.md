Let's analyze the provided program and the problem requirements step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Introverts (a):** Each introvert needs a tent by themselves.
- **Extroverts (b):** Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly two others.
- **Universals (c):** Universals can be in tents with 0, 1, or 2 others.

The goal is to determine the minimum number of tents required to satisfy all the participants' preferences. If it's impossible to do so, we should return `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The program provided is:
```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

Let's break down the program:
1. **Input Handling:** The program reads the input line by line, starting from the second line (since the first line is the number of test cases).
2. **Variable Assignment:** It splits each test case line into `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Combining Extroverts and Universals:** It sums `b` and `c` together, treating them as potential candidates for tents that can accommodate up to 3 people.
4. **Tent Calculation:** The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is used to determine the number of tents:
    - `-b // 3` calculates the number of tents needed for the combined extroverts and universals, assuming each tent can hold 3 people.
    - `a` is added to account for the tents needed for introverts.
    - The ternary-like expression uses the condition `c < b % 3`:
        - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, it means there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents for extroverts, and the result is `-1`.
        - Otherwise, it returns the calculated number of tents.

### Correctness Check:
The program's logic seems correct based on the problem's constraints and requirements:
- **Introverts:** Each introvert needs a tent by themselves, so `a` tents are definitely required.
- **Extroverts and Universals:** The sum `b + c` represents the total number of people who can potentially share tents. The expression `-b // 3` calculates the number of tents needed for these people, assuming each tent can hold 3 people.
- **Validation:** The condition `c < b % 3` checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents for extroverts. If not, it returns `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required or returns `-1` if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

**Correctness: True**
