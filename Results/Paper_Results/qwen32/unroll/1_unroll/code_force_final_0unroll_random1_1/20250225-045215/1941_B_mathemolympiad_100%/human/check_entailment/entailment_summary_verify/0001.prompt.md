You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(0, numTest):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        stop = False
        for i in range(0, n - 2):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                stop = True
                break
            opNum = a[i]
            a[i] -= opNum
            a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
            a[i + 2] -= opNum
        if stop == True:
            continue
        if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks if a specific sequence of operations can reduce the last two elements of the list `a` to zero without any element becoming negative during the process. It prints 'YES' if it's possible, otherwise 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step and determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to make all elements of an array zero by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\)) and reducing the values at positions \(i-1\), \(i\), and \(i+1\) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

### Key Observations

1. **Operation Constraints**: The operation can only be applied if the values at \(i-1\), \(i\), and \(i+1\) are sufficient to accommodate the reductions. Specifically, \(a_{i-1} \geq 1\), \(a_i \geq 2\), and \(a_{i+1} \geq 1\).

2. **Greedy Approach**: The given program attempts to apply the operation greedily from left to right. It reduces the leftmost possible triplet as much as possible until it can no longer do so.

3. **Final Checks**: After attempting to reduce the array from left to right, the program checks if the last two elements are zero. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Program Analysis

1. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one.

2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the number of elements \(n\) and the elements themselves into an array \(a\).

3. **Applying the Operation**: The program iterates through the array from the beginning to the third last element (inclusive). For each element \(a[i]\), it attempts to apply the operation as many times as possible (i.e., until \(a[i]\) becomes zero).

4. **Checking Validity**: If at any point the program finds that an element becomes negative (which indicates an invalid operation), it immediately prints "NO" and skips to the next test case.

5. **Final Check**: After processing the array, the program checks if the last two elements are zero. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Operation Application**: The program reduces the elements by the value of \(a[i]\) in each iteration, which is incorrect. The operation should reduce \(a[i]\) by 2, not by its current value.

2. **Negative Values Check**: The program correctly checks for negative values, but the logic for applying the operation is flawed.

3. **Final Check**: The final check is correct in the sense that if the last two elements are not zero, it's impossible to make the entire array zero using the given operation.

### Correctness

Given the issues in the operation application logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
