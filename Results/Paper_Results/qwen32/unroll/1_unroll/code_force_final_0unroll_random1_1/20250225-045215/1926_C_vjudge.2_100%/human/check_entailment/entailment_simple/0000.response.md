### Reasoning:

The program aims to compute the cumulative sum of the digit sums of integers from 1 to n for multiple test cases. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `N` is set to 200001 (which is `2 * 100000 + 1`), to accommodate the maximum possible value of `n` (which is `2 * 10^5`).
   - `t` is read from the input, representing the number of test cases.
   - `pd` is initialized as a list of zeros with length `N`. This list will be used to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums.

2. **Pre-computation**:
   - The program iterates over each integer `i` from 1 to `N-1` (i.e., 1 to 200000).
   - For each `i`, it adds the cumulative sum of the previous values in `pd` to `pd[i]`.
   - It then converts `i` to a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts it back to an integer, and adds it to `pd[i]`.
   - This results in `pd[i]` containing the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to `i`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each of the `t` test cases, the program reads an integer `n`.
   - It then prints `pd[n]`, which is the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Verification:

- The pre-computation step ensures that for each `n`, `pd[n]` contains the correct cumulative sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to `n`.
- The program efficiently handles multiple test cases by reusing the pre-computed values in `pd`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It pre-computes the cumulative sum of digit sums for all possible values of `n` up to `2 * 10^5` and then uses these pre-computed values to answer each test case in constant time.
