Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4) and `n` (an integer for each test case representing some value, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the value of `n` for that test case.**
