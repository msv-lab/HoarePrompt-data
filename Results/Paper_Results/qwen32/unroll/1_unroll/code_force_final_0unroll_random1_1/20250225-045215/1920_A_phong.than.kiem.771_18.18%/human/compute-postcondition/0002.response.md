To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which is `index` in this case. The loop will execute if `index` is not equal to `-1`. 

Given that `index` is the result of `string.find(substring)`, the value of `index` will be `-1` if `substring` is not found in `string`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, `substring` must be found in `string`, which means `index` should be a non-negative integer.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop condition is `index != -1`.
2. `index` is assigned the result of `string.find(substring)`.
3. For `index` to be non-negative, `substring` must be present in `string`.

Thus, we need to adjust the state so that `substring` is indeed a substring of `string`.

State: **`string` is a string that contains `substring`, `substring` is a string, `indices` is an empty list, `index` is the result of `string.find(substring)` and `index` is not -1**
