You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    #State: The output state remains unchanged except that each integer in the list `custos` has been printed to the console, one per line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (with `m` ≤ `n`), and two lists `a` and `b` of `n` integers each. For each test case, it computes a cost based on the values in lists `a` and `b` according to specific rules and prints the computed cost.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. The code seems to have a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop for Cost Calculation**:
   - The loop `for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)` and subsequent logic for calculating the cost is incorrect. It doesn't properly account for the scenario where Kirill needs to bribe multiple people to move up the queue.
   - The condition `if a_values[y] < b_values[y]` is not appropriate for determining the cost. Kirill needs to consider the total cost of bribing multiple people, not just comparing `a_i` and `b_i`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Bribes**:
   - The logic for bribing people in the queue is not correctly implemented. The code does not handle the scenario where Kirill needs to bribe multiple people and pay the `b_k` coins to the people between `j` and `i`.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases such as when `m = 1` (Kirill needs to be at the front of the queue) or when `m = n` (Kirill can be at the end of the queue).

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 1
3 2 1
1 1 1
```
- **Expected Output**: `6` (Kirill needs to bribe all three people to move to the front, paying `3 + 2 + 1 = 6` coins).
- **Actual Output**: The code does not correctly compute this and might output an incorrect value.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve using a priority queue or a similar data structure to always bribe the person with the minimum cost to move up the queue. The code should iterate over the queue and calculate the minimum cost required to move Kirill to the desired position `m`.

Given these issues, the provided code is incorrect.
