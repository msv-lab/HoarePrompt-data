The given code snippet creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in the string `r` is mapped to the character at its mirrored position from the end of `r`. 

Since `r` is a string containing unique characters from all strings in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order, the mapping will pair each character with its corresponding character from the end of `r`.

For example, if `r` is "abcde", the mapping will be:
- 'a' -> 'e'
- 'b' -> 'd'
- 'c' -> 'c'
- 'd' -> 'b'
- 'e' -> 'a'

The variable `encoded` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and its length n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `r` is a string containing unique characters from all strings in `encoded`, sorted in ascending order; `mapping` is a dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to the character at its mirrored position from the end of `r`.**
