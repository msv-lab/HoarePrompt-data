To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether the function `func_14()` correctly generates a sequence `a` that satisfies the conditions outlined in the problem statement for each test case. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Problem Recap
For each test case with integers `n` and `k`:
1. **No subsequence of `a` should sum up to `k`.**
2. **Every integer `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) should have a subsequence in `a` that sums up to `v`.**

### Analysis of `func_14()`
The function `func_14()` is responsible for generating the sequence `a` for each test case. Here's how it works:

1. **Binary Representation:**
   - `b` is the binary representation of `n`.
   - `bk` is the binary representation of `k`.

2. **Handling Special Case `k == 1`:**
   - If `k == 1`, the function handles this as a special case:
     - If `n == 2`, it returns `[2]` because the only valid sum is `2`.
     - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence starting with `[2, 3]` and then adds powers of `2` up to the length of the binary representation of `n` minus 2. This ensures that all sums from `1` to `n` (excluding `1`) can be formed.

3. **General Case `k != 1`:**
   - It constructs a sequence starting with powers of `2` up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus 1.
   - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure that the sum of the initial sequence does not reach `k`.
   - It adds `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence, ensuring that `k` cannot be formed as a sum.
   - Finally, it adds powers of `2` starting from the length of the binary representation of `k` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements
- **Condition 1 (No subsequence sums to `k`):**
  - The inclusion of `k - 1 - sum(ans)` and the specific values `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence of `a`.
  
- **Condition 2 (All sums from `1` to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed):**
  - The sequence includes powers of `2`, which can be combined to form any sum up to `n` (excluding `k`).
  - The special handling for `k == 1` ensures that the sequence can form all sums from `1` to `n` excluding `1`.

### Conclusion
The function `func_14()` appears to correctly generate a sequence `a` that satisfies both conditions for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
