Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`; `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. If `k` equals 1, `ans` is `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^(l-1)]`. Otherwise, `ans` is `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2]`.**
