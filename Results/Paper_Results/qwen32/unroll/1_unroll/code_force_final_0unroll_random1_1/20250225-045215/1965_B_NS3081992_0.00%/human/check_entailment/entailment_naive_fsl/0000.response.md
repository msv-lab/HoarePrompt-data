Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_14()` generates a sequence that does not necessarily satisfy the conditions for all possible values of `n` and `k`.

Let's analyze the code and the problem requirements:

1. **Condition 1**: There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
2. **Condition 2**: For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

The code handles binary representations of `n` and `k` and constructs sequences based on these representations. However, there are specific cases where the constructed sequence might not meet the conditions.

### Example Case 1: `n = 8`, `k = 8`
The code generates the sequence `[1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 17]` for `n = 8` and `k = 8`. Here, `7` can be formed by the subsequence `[1, 2, 4]`, but `9` cannot be formed using the numbers in the sequence `[1, 2, 4, 7]` alone, which means the sequence is incorrect.

### Example Case 2: `n = 10`, `k = 7`
The code generates the sequence `[1, 2, 8, 3]` for `n = 10` and `k = 7`. Here, `7` cannot be formed by any subsequence of `[1, 2, 8, 3]`, but `11` can be formed by `[3, 8]`, which is not within the range `[1, 10]`. Also, `6` cannot be formed by any subsequence of `[1, 2, 8, 3]`.

### Example Case 3: `n = 6`, `k = 1`
The code generates the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` for `n = 6` and `k = 1`. Here, `1` cannot be formed by any subsequence of `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which satisfies the first condition. However, `1` is not within the range `[1, 6]` except for `k`, so the sequence is correct for this specific case. But we need to ensure it works for all cases.

### Example Case 4: `n = 9`, `k = 3`
The code generates the sequence `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` for `n = 9` and `k = 3`. Here, `3` can be formed by the subsequence `[1, 1, 1]`, which violates the first condition.

From these examples, it is clear that the provided code does not handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
