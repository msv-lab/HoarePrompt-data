To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_10()` and `func_14()` do. Since the specific implementations of these functions are not provided, we can only reason based on their typical usage in such contexts:

- `func_10()` likely returns the number of iterations for the loop.
- `func_14()` likely returns a value or string to be printed in each iteration.

Assuming `func_10()` returns `n` (the number of test cases or iterations), and `func_14()` returns a sequence of values or a single value that gets printed in each iteration, the loop will execute `n` times, printing the result of `func_14()` followed by a newline character in each iteration.

Let's assume `func_10()` returns 3 and `func_14()` returns the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in each iteration respectively for the sake of an example. The loop will execute 3 times and print:
```
1
2
3
```

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations would be the printed output of these function calls.

Output State: **the printed output of `func_14()` for each iteration, each followed by a newline character.**
