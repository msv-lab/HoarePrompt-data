Precondition: **s is a list of strings, where each string b in s consists of lowercase Latin letters and represents the result of encoding an original string s. The length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5, and the total length of all strings in s does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. Additionally, s contains between 1 and 10^4 strings, each representing a separate test case.**
