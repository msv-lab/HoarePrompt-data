Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string `b` to obtain the original string `s`. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**: The program attempts to replace characters in the string `s` (which should be `b` in this context) with characters from the end of the `unique_chars` list. However, it does not correctly map each character in `b` back to its original character in `s`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Characters**: The program incorrectly handles the unique characters and their replacements. It uses `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` which replaces all occurrences of `char` in `s` with `unique_chars[j]`, which is not the intended behavior. Instead, it should map each character in `b` to its corresponding original character based on the symmetric position in the `unique_chars` list.

3. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The loop logic for replacing characters is flawed. The program should iterate over each character in `b` and find its symmetric counterpart in `unique_chars` to build the original string `s`.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in b)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)
```

In this corrected version:
- We first determine the unique characters in `b` and sort them.
- We create a mapping from each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric counterpart.
- We then use this mapping to decode `b` back to the original string `s`.
