a is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, m1, m2) representing the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums respectively. b is a list of lists, where each inner list contains m1 integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order. The next inner list contains m2 integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
