Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, the function returns different tuples as follows:**

- **Case_1:** If the function reaches a specific internal condition (not detailed in the constraints), it returns the tuple `(1, 0)`.
- **Case_2:** If `a` is greater than `b`, the function returns a tuple where the first element is the remainder of `b` divided by `a`, and the second element is the quotient of `b` divided by `a`.
- **Case_3:** If `a` is divisible by `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the function returns the tuple `(1, -(a // b - 1))`.
- **Case_4:** If none of the above cases are met, the function recursively calls itself with the parameters `b` and `a % b`, and then uses the returned values to compute and return a new tuple based on the formula `d` and `c - a // b * d`.
