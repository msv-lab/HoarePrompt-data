### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximums. Here is a detailed breakdown of the program and its correctness:

1. **Precomputation of Factorials**:
    - The program precomputes factorials up to 200001 modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is necessary for calculating combinations, which are used to determine the number of valid permutations.

2. **Input Parsing**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m1`, `m2`, the list of prefix maximum indices `p`, and the list of suffix maximum indices `s`.

3. **Initial Checks**:
    - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index is the same as the first suffix maximum index, and if the first prefix maximum index is 1, and the last suffix maximum index is `n`. If any of these conditions are not met, the program outputs 0 because such a permutation is impossible.

4. **Calculating Combinations**:
    - The program calculates the number of valid permutations by considering the segments between the prefix and suffix maximums.
    - It uses the function `func_2` to compute the modular inverse of factorials, which is necessary for calculating combinations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
    - The combination formula used is \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\), and the program calculates this for each segment.

5. **Combination of Results**:
    - The program multiplies the results of all the combinations and the factorials of the gaps between the prefix and suffix maximums to get the final answer.

6. **Modulo Operation**:
    - Throughout the calculations, the program ensures that all intermediate results are taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow and to meet the problem's requirements.

### Function Analysis:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
    - This function computes the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity for two integers `a` and `b`. It is used to find the modular inverse of `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
    - The function is correctly implemented using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
    - This function uses `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and multiplies it by `a`.
    - This is used to compute the modular inverse of factorials, which is necessary for calculating combinations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It uses the precomputed factorials, checks the necessary conditions for the prefix and suffix maximums, and correctly calculates the number of valid permutations using combinations and modular arithmetic.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
