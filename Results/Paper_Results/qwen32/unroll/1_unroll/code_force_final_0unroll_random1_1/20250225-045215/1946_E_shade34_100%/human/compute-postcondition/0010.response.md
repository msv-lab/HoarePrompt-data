To determine the Output State, we need to consider the impact of the code on the variables and the function call. The code snippet provided is:

```python
c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
```

This line of code calls a function `func_1` with two arguments: `b` and `a % b`. The function `func_1` returns two values which are assigned to the variables `c` and `d`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
- `b` is not equal to 0.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
- `a` is not divisible by `b`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d` without the function's implementation. However, we can infer that `c` and `d` will be assigned the values returned by `func_1`.

The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are passed to the function but not modified by the assignment of the return values to `c` and `d`.

Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers, `b` is not equal to 0, `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, `a` is not divisible by `b`, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`**.
