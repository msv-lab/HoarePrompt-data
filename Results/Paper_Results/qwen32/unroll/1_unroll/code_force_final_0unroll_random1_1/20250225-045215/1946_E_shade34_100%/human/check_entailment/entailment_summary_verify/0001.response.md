### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code is incomplete and does not address the core logic required to solve the problem of counting permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are related to modular arithmetic, specifically computing modular inverses, which are useful for handling large numbers and modular operations. However, these functions alone are not sufficient to solve the problem at hand.

The problem requires a combinatorial approach to count the number of valid permutations that satisfy the prefix and suffix maximum conditions. This involves more complex logic, such as dynamic programming or combinatorial counting techniques, which are not present in the provided code. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
