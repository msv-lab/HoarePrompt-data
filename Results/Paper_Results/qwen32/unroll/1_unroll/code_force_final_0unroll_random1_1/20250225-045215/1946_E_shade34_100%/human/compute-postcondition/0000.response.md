The code snippet calls a function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `1000000007`, and assigns the returned values to variables `c` and `d`. The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are integers. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d` that will be returned. However, we can state that `c` and `d` will hold the values returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is the first value returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, `d` is the second value returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`**.
