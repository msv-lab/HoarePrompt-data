Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, and `q`, lists `a` and `b`, and `q` queries. For each query `d`, it calculates and prints a value based on the relationship between the lists `a` and `b`. The function outputs a series of integers, one for each query, representing the calculated values.**
