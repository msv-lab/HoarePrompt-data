You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Timur is in a car traveling on the number line from point 0 to point n . The
car starts moving from point 0 at minute 0 .

There are k+1 signs on the line at points 0, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k , and Timur
knows that the car will arrive there at minutes 0, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_k ,
respectively. The sequences a and b are strictly increasing with a_k = n .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/eaf3bfb8e7a8fa4f5e8673f9a02116761cb86c93.png)

Between any two adjacent signs, the car travels with a constant speed. Timur
has q queries: each query will be an integer d , and Timur wants you to output
how many minutes it takes the car to reach point d , rounded down to the
nearest integer.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and q , (k
\leq n \leq 10^9 ; 1 \leq k, q \leq 10^5 ) — the final destination, the number
of points Timur knows the time for, and the number of queries respectively.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_i (1 \leq a_i \leq n ;
a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ; a_k = n ).

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_i (1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9
; b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ).

Each of the following q lines contains a single integer d (0 \leq d \leq n ) —
the distance that Timur asks the minutes passed for.

The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 , and the sum of q over
all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output a single integer — the number of minutes passed until
the car reaches the point d , rounded down.

Note

For the first test case, the car goes from point 0 to point 10 in 10 minutes,
so the speed is 1 unit per minute and:

  * At point 0 , the time will be 0 minutes. 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 6 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 7 minutes. 

For the second test case, between points 0 and 4 , the car travels at a speed
of 1 unit per minute and between 4 and 10 with a speed of 2 units per minute
and:

  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 4 , the time will be 4 minutes. 
  * At point 2 , the time will be 2 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 5.5 minutes, so the answer is 5 . 

For the fourth test case, the car travels with 1.2 units per minute, so the
answers to the queries are:

  * At point 2 , the time will be 1.66\dots minutes, so the answer is 1 . 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 5 , the time will be 4.16\dots minutes, so the answer is 4 .

        a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, and `q`, lists `a` and `b`, and `q` queries. For each query `d`, it calculates and prints a value based on the relationship between the lists `a` and `b`. The function outputs a series of integers, one for each query, representing the calculated values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the program to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the final destination `n`, the number of known points `k`, and the number of queries `q`.
   - Then, it reads the list of known points `a` and the corresponding times `b`.
   - Both `a` and `b` are padded with a 0 at the beginning to simplify calculations.

2. **Calculating Distances and Speeds:**
   - `ad` is a list of distances between adjacent points in `a`.
   - `bd` is a list of time intervals between corresponding points in `b`.
   - `v` is a list of speeds between each pair of adjacent points. Speed is calculated as the ratio of distance to time.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query `d`, the program determines which segment of the journey `d` falls into using `bisect_left` on the list `a`.
   - If `d` is exactly at a known point, the corresponding time in `b` is printed.
   - If `d` is between two known points, the program calculates the exact time to reach `d` based on the speed in that segment.
   - The time is calculated as the time to reach the previous known point plus the time to travel the remaining distance at the segment's speed.
   - The result is rounded down using `int()` before printing.

### Correctness:

- **Input Handling:** The program correctly handles the input as specified in the problem statement.
- **Distance and Speed Calculation:** The distances and speeds are calculated correctly based on the given points and times.
- **Query Handling:** The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to efficiently determine which segment a query point falls into and calculates the correct time based on the speed in that segment.
- **Output:** The results are printed in the correct format and rounded down as required.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and efficiently calculates the required times for each query.

**Correctness: True**
