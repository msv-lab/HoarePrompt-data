The code snippet initializes a new set named `vis`. This does not affect the existing variables `arr`, `nums`, or `start`. The new set `vis` is empty.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `nums` is a `Counter` object representing the counts of each integer in `arr`; `start` is 0; `vis` is an empty set.**
