Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three elements: `n`, an integer representing the length of a string; `m`, an integer; and `a`, a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the calculated `missing` value for each test case.**
