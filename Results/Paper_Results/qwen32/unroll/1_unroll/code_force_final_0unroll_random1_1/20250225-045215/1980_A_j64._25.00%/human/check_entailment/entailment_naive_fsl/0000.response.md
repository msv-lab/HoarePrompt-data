Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where the number of rounds `m` is greater than the number of unique difficulties available in the bank of problems. The code calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level independently, without considering that the same problem can be reused across different rounds.

To illustrate, let's consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
7 2
ABCDEFG
```
Expected Output:
```
0
```
Explanation: Vlad already has one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. Since he only needs to hold 2 rounds and he has all 7 difficulty levels available, he does not need to create any additional problems.

However, the provided code will output `7` for this input because it calculates the missing problems for each difficulty level independently, assuming that `m` problems of each difficulty level are needed, which is incorrect.

Here's a corrected version of the code that handles this case correctly:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create.

    Args:
        t (int): Number of test cases.
        test_cases (list): List of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing
            - n (int): Number of problems in the bank.
            - m (int): Number of upcoming rounds.
            - a (str): String of problem difficulties.

    Returns:
        list: List of results, one for each test case.
    """
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, a) = test_cases[_]
        freq = [0] * 7
        for prob in a:
            freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
        unique_difficulties = sum(f > 0 for f in freq)
        if unique_difficulties >= 7:
            missing = 0
        else:
            missing = max(0, m * 7 - sum(freq))
        results.append(missing)
    return results
```

However, the original code does not account for the fact that Vlad can reuse problems across rounds, so it is incorrect.
