You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Function Summary: 
The function calculates the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. It takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (number of problems), an integer `m` (number of upcoming rounds), and a string `a` (problem difficulties). The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of additional problems needed for the corresponding test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where the number of rounds `m` is greater than the number of unique difficulties available in the bank of problems. The code calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level independently, without considering that the same problem can be reused across different rounds.

To illustrate, let's consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
7 2
ABCDEFG
```
Expected Output:
```
0
```
Explanation: Vlad already has one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. Since he only needs to hold 2 rounds and he has all 7 difficulty levels available, he does not need to create any additional problems.

However, the provided code will output `7` for this input because it calculates the missing problems for each difficulty level independently, assuming that `m` problems of each difficulty level are needed, which is incorrect.

Here's a corrected version of the code that handles this case correctly:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create.

    Args:
        t (int): Number of test cases.
        test_cases (list): List of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing
            - n (int): Number of problems in the bank.
            - m (int): Number of upcoming rounds.
            - a (str): String of problem difficulties.

    Returns:
        list: List of results, one for each test case.
    """
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, a) = test_cases[_]
        freq = [0] * 7
        for prob in a:
            freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
        unique_difficulties = sum(f > 0 for f in freq)
        if unique_difficulties >= 7:
            missing = 0
        else:
            missing = max(0, m * 7 - sum(freq))
        results.append(missing)
    return results
```

However, the original code does not account for the fact that Vlad can reuse problems across rounds, so it is incorrect.
