The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the expression `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which should be the number of test cases `t`. The current state does not specify the value of `t` in a way that guarantees the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `t` is at least 1, as the loop will only execute if `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= b_i <= 10^6; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `max_val` is 1000000; `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros; `t` must be at least 1**
