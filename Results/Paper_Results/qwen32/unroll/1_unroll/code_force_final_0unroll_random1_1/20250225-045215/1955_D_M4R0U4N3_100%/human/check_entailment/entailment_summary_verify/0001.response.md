### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to validate the correctness of the solution.

#### Key Points of the Program:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `max_val` is set to 1,000,000, which is the maximum possible value for elements in `a` and `b`.
   - `cnt_b` is an array of size `max_val + 1` initialized to 0. This array keeps track of the counts of elements in `b`.

2. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

3. **Counting Elements in `b`:**
   - For each element in `b`, the program increments the corresponding index in `cnt_b`.

4. **Initial Window Check:**
   - The program processes the first subarray of length `m` in `a`:
     - For each element in this subarray, if it is in `b_values` (a set of elements in `b`), it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is still non-negative.
     - If `curr` (the number of matching elements) is at least `k`, it increments `ans`.

5. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - The program slides the window across `a` from position `1` to `n - m`:
     - For each new position, it adjusts the counts in `cnt_b`:
       - It increments the count for the element that is sliding out of the window.
       - It decrements the count for the element that is sliding into the window.
       - It updates `curr` accordingly.
     - If `curr` is at least `k` after adjusting, it increments `ans`.

6. **Output:**
   - After processing each test case, the program outputs `ans`.

7. **Resetting Counts:**
   - After each test case, the program resets the counts in `cnt_b` for elements in `b`.

#### Evaluation:

- **Initialization and Input Reading:**
  - The initialization of `cnt_b` and the reading of inputs are straightforward and correctly implemented.

- **Counting Elements in `b`:**
  - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element in `b` using `cnt_b`.

- **Initial Window Check:**
  - The initial window check is correctly implemented. It checks the first `m` elements of `a` and counts how many of them are in `b` by using `cnt_b`.

- **Sliding Window Technique:**
  - The sliding window technique is correctly implemented. As the window slides, the program efficiently updates the count of elements in the current window by adjusting `cnt_b` and `curr`.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly outputs the number of good subarrays for each test case.

- **Resetting Counts:**
  - After processing each test case, the program resets the counts in `cnt_b` for elements in `b` to ensure that the next test case starts with a clean state.

#### Edge Cases:

- **When `k` is 1:**
  - Any subarray with at least one matching element is valid.
- **When `k` is `m`:**
  - The subarray must match all elements in `b`.
- **When `m` is 1:**
  - Each element in `a` is a subarray of length 1.

The program handles all these edge cases correctly.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the solution using a sliding window approach and handles all constraints and edge cases appropriately.

**Final: True**
