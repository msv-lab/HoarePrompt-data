### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the maximum number of elements that can be made equal in an array after adding a permutation to it. Hereâ€™s the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - `func_1()` is used to read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `func_3()` reads the array `a` and converts it into a list of integers.
   
2. **Processing**:
   - The array `a` is converted to a list of unique elements and sorted.
   - The variable `m` stores the maximum value in the sorted array.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the maximum frequency of any element after adding a permutation.
   - The program iterates over each unique element in the sorted array.
   - For each element, it uses `bisect_left` to find the position in the sorted array where the element plus `n` (the length of the array) would fit.
   - The difference between this position and the current index gives the count of elements that can be made equal to the current element plus some permutation value.
   - The maximum of these counts is stored in `ans`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum frequency `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Uniqueness and Sorting**: The program converts the array to unique elements and sorts them. This is a valid approach because adding a permutation can only shift elements within the range of 1 to `n`, and thus, we only need to consider unique elements.
- **Bisect Usage**: `bisect_left` is correctly used to find the position where the shifted element would fit in the sorted array.
- **Counting Elements**: The difference `a - i` correctly calculates the count of elements that can be made equal to the current element plus some permutation value.
- **Max Frequency**: The program correctly keeps track of the maximum frequency of any element after adding a permutation.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to be correctly implementing the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the input as required, processes the data correctly, and outputs the expected results.

### Correctness:
