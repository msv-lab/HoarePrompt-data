To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the provided code solves the problem as described. The program includes several utility functions for reading input and performing basic operations, but it does not contain the main logic to solve the problem. Let's break down the problem and the provided code.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements that can be made equal in the array after adding a permutation to it. The key insight here is that the permutation can be chosen optimally to maximize the frequency of any element in the array.

### Key Observations:
1. **Permutation Properties**: A permutation of length `n` consists of distinct integers from 1 to `n`. Therefore, the smallest possible sum we can add to any element in the array is 1 (by adding 1 from the permutation), and the largest possible sum is `n` (by adding `n` from the permutation).
2. **Optimal Strategy**: To maximize the frequency of any element in the array, we should try to make as many elements as possible equal to the same value after adding the permutation. The optimal strategy involves aligning the elements in the array with the permutation values in a way that maximizes overlap.

### Solution Approach:
The optimal approach involves:
- Sorting the array.
- Considering each possible value that can be the target value after adding the permutation.
- Checking how many elements can be made equal to this target value by adding the appropriate permutation values.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code includes several utility functions for input/output operations, but it does not contain the main logic to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` to `func_9` are utility functions that perform tasks such as reading integers, mapping strings, and computing prefix/suffix products, but none of these directly address the problem of finding the maximum frequency of elements after adding a permutation.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided code does not contain the main logic to solve the problem, it is incorrect. The code is missing the core algorithm that would determine the maximum frequency of elements after adding a permutation to the array.

**Correctness: False**
