Let's carefully analyze the provided code, problem description, and the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the maximum number of elements in the array that can be made equal after adding a permutation to the array. The key insight is that adding a permutation (which consists of distinct integers from 1 to n) can shift the elements in such a way that we maximize the frequency of any single number in the array.

### Provided Code Analysis
The provided code is:

```python
from bisect import bisect_left

for _ in range(func_1()):
    n = func_1()
    arr = sorted(list(set(func_3())))
    m = max(arr)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        a = bisect_left(arr, arr[i] + n)
        d = a - i
        ans = max(ans, d)
    print(ans)
```

#### Function Descriptions
- `func_1()`: Reads and returns an integer from input.
- `func_3()`: Reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each to an integer, and returns the list of integers.

#### Code Behavior
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, the length of the array `n` is read using `func_1()`.
   - The array `a` is read using `func_3()` and then converted to a sorted list of unique elements.

2. **Finding Maximum Frequency**:
   - The code initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates over the sorted unique elements of the array.
   - For each element, it finds the index `a` where the element `arr[i] + n` would fit in the sorted list using `bisect_left`.
   - The difference `d = a - i` is calculated, which represents the number of elements in the range `[arr[i], arr[i] + n)`.
   - The maximum of these differences is stored in `ans`.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the value of `ans` is printed.

### Evaluation Using Annotations
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, which align with the code's behavior:
- `arr` is a sorted list of unique elements from the input array.
- `bisect_left` is used to find where `arr[i] + n` would fit in the sorted list, effectively counting how many elements are in the range `[arr[i], arr[i] + n)`.

### Correctness of the Code
The code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal after adding a permutation:
- By sorting the unique elements and using `bisect_left`, it counts how many elements can be shifted into the same range `[arr[i], arr[i] + n)`.
- The maximum of these counts is the answer, which is the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.

### Conclusion
The original assessment incorrectly states that the code does not contain the required function to solve the problem. The provided code does indeed implement the required logic and is correct for the problem description.

**Final: True**
