Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the total number of vertices, an integer `x` representing the number of chosen vertices, and an integer `y` representing a specific constraint on the vertices. Additionally, it receives a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns a specific output based on these inputs for each test case.**
