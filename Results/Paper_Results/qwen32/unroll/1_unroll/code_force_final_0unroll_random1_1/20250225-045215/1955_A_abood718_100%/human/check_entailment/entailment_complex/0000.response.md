Let's analyze the provided program and its logic in relation to the problem description and the given test cases.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts given two pricing options:
1. One yogurt for `a` burles.
2. Two yogurts for `b` burles.

### Program Analysis:
The program processes `t` test cases, each containing `n`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the minimum cost using the following logic:

1. **If buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion (`2*a < b`)**:
   - The program calculates the total cost as `n * a`.

2. **If `n` is even**:
   - The program calculates the total cost as `(n / 2) * b`.

3. **If `n` is odd**:
   - The program calculates the total cost as `((n // 2) * b) + a`.

### Test Case Validation:
Let's validate the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test case 1 (`n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`)**:
   - Since `2 * 5 < 9` is false, and `n` is even, the cost is `(2 / 2) * 9 = 9`.

2. **Test case 2 (`n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`)**:
   - Since `2 * 5 < 9` is false, and `n` is odd, the cost is `((3 // 2) * 9) + 5 = 4 * 9 + 5 = 14`.

3. **Test case 3 (`n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`)**:
   - Since `2 * 5 < 11` is true, the cost is `3 * 5 = 15`.

4. **Test case 4 (`n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`)**:
   - Since `2 * 5 < 11` is true, the cost is `4 * 5 = 20`.

### Program Correction:
There is an error in the program logic. The condition `if B * 2 < C` should be `if a * 2 < b` to correctly compare the cost of buying two yogurts individually versus buying them in a promotion. The variable names `A`, `B`, and `C` should correspond to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a * 2 < b:
            print(n * a)
        elif n % 2 == 0:
            print(int(n * b / 2))
        else:
            X = n // 2
            print(X * b + a)

#State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30. The loop variable i will be equal to t after the loop completes. n, a, and b will not hold specific values as they are re-assigned in each iteration.
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the misnamed variables and the incorrect comparison condition. After correcting the condition and variable names, the program should work correctly.

Correctness: **False**
