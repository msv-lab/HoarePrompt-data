Let's analyze the provided Python program and determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts. The store offers two options:
1. Buy one yogurt for `a` burles.
2. Buy two yogurts for `b` burles.

The goal is to minimize the total cost to buy `n` yogurts.

### Key Points:
- If `b < 2 * a`, it is cheaper to buy two yogurts together.
- If `b >= 2 * a`, it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually.

### Logic Analysis:
- **If `b < 2 * a`**:
  - If `n` is even, it's optimal to buy `n / 2` pairs of yogurts.
  - If `n` is odd, it's optimal to buy `(n - 1) / 2` pairs and 1 yogurt separately.
  
- **If `b >= 2 * a`**:
  - It's always cheaper or equally expensive to buy each yogurt individually.

### Program Analysis:
Let's check the provided code against the logic.

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

#### Issues:
- The condition `if B * 2 < C` is correct for determining if buying two yogurts together is cheaper.
- However, the condition `elif A % 2 == 0` is not correct. The program should consider buying as many pairs as possible, regardless of whether `n` is even or odd.
- The `else` block correctly calculates the cost when `n` is odd, but it should be applied to all cases where `b < 2 * a` for odd `n`.

### Corrected Logic:
- If `b < 2 * a`, calculate the cost as `(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`.
- If `b >= 2 * a`, the cost is simply `n * a`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print((A // 2) * C + (A % 2) * B)
        else:
            print(A * B)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle the case when `b < 2 * a` and `n` is odd. It incorrectly assumes that buying all yogurts in pairs is always optimal when `n` is even, which is not always the case.

Thus, the correctness of the provided program is:

**Correctness: False**
