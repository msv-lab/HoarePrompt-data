Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis Recap
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts at the minimum cost with two options:
1. Buy one yogurt for `a` burles.
2. Buy two yogurts for `b` burles (promotion price).

### Program Analysis Recap
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts under promotion).

The logic in the program is:
1. If `2 * a < b`, it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. The total cost is `n * a`.
2. If `n` is even, it is always cheaper or equal to buy yogurts in pairs at the promotion price. The total cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
3. If `n` is odd, Maxim can buy `(n - 1)` yogurts in pairs and the last yogurt individually. The total cost is `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

### Verification with the Provided Example

Let's verify the program with the provided example.

**Test Case 1:**
- `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
- Since `2 * a = 10 > b`, Maxim buys 2 yogurts at the promotion price: cost = `9`.
- The program correctly computes the cost as `9`.

**Test Case 2:**
- `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
- Since `2 * a = 10 > b`, Maxim buys 2 yogurts at the promotion price and 1 yogurt individually: cost = `9 + 5 = 14`.
- The program correctly computes the cost as `14`.

**Test Case 3:**
- `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
- Since `2 * a = 10 < b`, Maxim buys all yogurts individually: cost = `3 * 5 = 15`.
- The program incorrectly computes the cost as `15`. Here, it should actually be `9 + 5 = 14` because it is cheaper to buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price and 1 yogurt individually.

**Test Case 4:**
- `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
- Since `2 * a = 10 < b`, Maxim buys all yogurts individually: cost = `4 * 5 = 20`.
- The program incorrectly computes the cost as `20`. Here, it should actually be `2 * 9 = 18` because it is cheaper to buy 4 yogurts in two pairs at the promotion price.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is inaccurate because it fails to correctly identify the minimum cost in some cases. Specifically, when `2 * a < b`, the program should still consider if buying in pairs is cheaper than buying individually for odd `n`.

### Correct Logic
The correct logic should be:
1. If `2 * a < b`, calculate the cost as `n * a`.
2. Otherwise, calculate the cost as `(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`.

### Final Evaluation
The given program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
