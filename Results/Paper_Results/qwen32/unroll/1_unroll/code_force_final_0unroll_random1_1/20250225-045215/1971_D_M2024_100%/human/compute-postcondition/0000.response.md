The code snippet provided is `t = int(input())`. This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer within the range 1 to 500. However, the code will overwrite the value of `t` with the new input value. The string `s` and its properties remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 <= |s| <= 500.**
