### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string so that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's). The key observation is that each transition from '1' to '0' indicates a necessary cut, as these segments need to be separated to sort the string. Additionally, if there are no '0' to '1' transitions, the string is already sorted or can be made sorted with a single piece, hence the result is `cut1 + 1`.

Let's break down the logic of the provided code:

1. **Input Reading**: The code reads `t`, the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads a binary string `a`.

2. **Counting Transitions**:
   - `cut0` counts the number of transitions from '0' to '1'.
   - `cut1` counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0'.

3. **Determining the Result**:
   - If there are no '0' to '1' transitions (`cut0 == 0`), the minimum number of pieces required is `cut1 + 1`. This accounts for the scenario where the string is already sorted or can be sorted with one piece.
   - Otherwise, the minimum number of pieces required is `cut0 + cut1`. This accounts for the necessary cuts at each transition.

The code correctly implements this logic. Here's a verification with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `11010`
  - Transitions: `cut1 = 2` (from 1 to 0 at indices 1 and 3)
  - Result: `cut1 + 1 = 3`

- **Test Case 2**: `00000000`
  - Transitions: `cut0 = 0`, `cut1 = 0`
  - Result: `cut1 + 1 = 1`

- **Test Case 3**: `1`
  - Transitions: `cut0 = 0`, `cut1 = 0`
  - Result: `cut1 + 1 = 1`

- **Test Case 4**: `10`
  - Transitions: `cut1 = 1`
  - Result: `cut1 + 1 = 2`

- **Test Case 5**: `0001111`
  - Transitions: `cut0 = 1`
  - Result: `cut0 + cut1 = 1`

- **Test Case 6**: `0110`
  - Transitions: `cut0 = 1`, `cut1 = 1`
  - Result: `cut0 + cut1 = 2`

All test cases match the expected output, confirming the correctness of the program.
