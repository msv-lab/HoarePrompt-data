### Reasoning:

To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of pieces we need to cut a binary string into so that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

The key observation here is that a cut is needed whenever we transition from a '1' to a '0' or from a '0' to a '1'. This is because these transitions indicate a disruption in the order required for a sorted binary string. The number of cuts needed is directly related to these transitions.

Let's break down the program's logic:
1. For each test case, the program reads a binary string.
2. It initializes two counters, `cut0` and `cut1`, to zero. These counters track the number of transitions from '0' to '1' and from '1' to '0', respectively.
3. It then iterates through the string and increments `cut1` whenever it encounters a '1' followed by a '0', and `cut0` whenever it encounters a '0' followed by a '1'.
4. After processing the string, the program determines the minimum number of pieces required:
   - If there are no '0' to '1' transitions (`cut0 == 0`), then the number of pieces needed is `cut1 + 1`. This is because if there are no '0' to '1' transitions, the string can be considered as a series of '1's followed by a series of '0's, and we need one additional piece for the initial segment.
   - Otherwise, the number of pieces needed is `cut0 + cut1`. This accounts for all the transitions between '0's and '1's.

This logic correctly handles the problem requirements.

### Example Walkthrough:
- For the input `11010`:
  - Transitions: '1' to '0' (at position 1), '0' to '1' (at position 2), '1' to '0' (at position 3).
  - `cut1 = 2`, `cut0 = 1`.
  - Since `cut0 != 0`, the number of pieces needed is `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 2 = 3`.

- For the input `00000000`:
  - No transitions.
  - `cut1 = 0`, `cut0 = 0`.
  - Since `cut0 == 0`, the number of pieces needed is `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.

- For the input `1`:
  - No transitions.
  - `cut1 = 0`, `cut0 = 0`.
  - Since `cut0 == 0`, the number of pieces needed is `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.

- For the input `10`:
  - Transition: '1' to '0' (at position 0).
  - `cut1 = 1`, `cut0 = 0`.
  - Since `cut0 == 0`, the number of pieces needed is `cut1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.

- For the input `0001111`:
  - No transitions.
  - `cut1 = 0`, `cut0 = 0`.
  - Since `cut0 == 0`, the number of pieces needed is `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.

- For the input `0110`:
  - Transitions: '0' to '1' (at position 0), '1' to '0' (at position 2).
  - `cut1 = 1`, `cut0 = 1`.
  - Since `cut0 != 0`, the number of pieces needed is `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string.

**Correctness: True**
