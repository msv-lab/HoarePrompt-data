Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to find the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) we need to cut a binary string into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Key Observations:
1. **Sorted Binary String**: The desired output is a binary string where all '0's appear before any '1's.
2. **Transition Points**: The critical points in the string are where a '1' is followed by a '0' or vice versa. These transitions indicate the points where a cut might be necessary.
3. **Counting Cuts**:
   - If a '1' is followed by a '0', it indicates that the substring must be cut to ensure that '1's do not precede '0's in the final sorted string.
   - Similarly, if a '0' is followed by a '1', it also indicates a necessary cut.

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the binary string `a`.
- It initializes counters `cut0` and `cut1` to zero. These counters are meant to track transitions from '0' to '1' and from '1' to '0', respectively.
- It then iterates through the string and increments `cut1` when it encounters a '1' followed by a '0', and increments `cut0` when it encounters a '0' followed by a '1'.
- After counting the transitions, it checks:
  - If `cut0` is zero (meaning no '0' followed by '1' transitions), it prints `cut1 + 1`. This is because if there are no '0' to '1' transitions, the string can be cut at each '1' to '0' transition and rearranged to form a sorted string. Adding 1 accounts for the initial segment.
  - Otherwise, it prints `cut0 + cut1`. This accounts for all transitions, as each transition point needs a cut.

### Correctness:
The program correctly identifies the necessary cut points based on the transitions between '0's and '1's. However, there is a logical flaw:
- If `cut0` is zero, it means there are no '0' to '1' transitions, which implies the string is already sorted or can be sorted with just the '1' to '0' transitions. Thus, the number of pieces needed is indeed `cut1 + 1` (accounting for the initial segment).
- If `cut0` is not zero, the number of pieces is correctly calculated as `cut0 + cut1`.

The program handles the cases where the string is already sorted, or where it requires cutting at transitions correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the analysis above.

Correctness: **True**
