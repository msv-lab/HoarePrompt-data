#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order. n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities in each test case. Additionally, each test case includes m queries, where m is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) representing the number of queries, followed by m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost is to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999
        
        forward = 99999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: `prog_cities` is a list of length `n - 1` where `prog_cities[0]` is `cities[1] - cities[0]`, `prog_cities[n-2]` is 1, and for all other `i` (`1 ≤ i ≤ n-3`), `prog_cities[i]` is 1 if `cities[i+1] - cities[i] < cities[i] - cities[i-1]`, otherwise `prog_cities[i]` is `cities[i+1] - cities[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns `prog_cities`, a list of length `n - 1` where `prog_cities[0]` is `cities[1] - cities[0]`, `prog_cities[n-2]` is 1, and for all other `i` (`1 ≤ i ≤ n-3`), `prog_cities[i]` is 1 if `cities[i+1] - cities[i] < cities[i] - cities[i-1]`, otherwise `prog_cities[i]` is `cities[i+1] - cities[i]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of city coordinates in ascending order and an integer `n` representing the number of cities. It returns a list `prog_cities` of length `n - 1`, where each element indicates the minimum travel cost between consecutive cities based on specific conditions. Specifically, `prog_cities[0]` is the difference between the second and first city, `prog_cities[n-2]` is 1, and for all other indices `i` (`1 ≤ i ≤ n-3`), `prog_cities[i]` is 1 if the difference between the next and current city is less than the difference between the current and previous city; otherwise, it is the difference between the next and current city.
