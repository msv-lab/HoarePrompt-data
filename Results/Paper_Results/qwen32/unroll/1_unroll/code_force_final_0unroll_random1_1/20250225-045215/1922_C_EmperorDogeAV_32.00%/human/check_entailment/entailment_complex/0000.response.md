### Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by calculating the minimum cost of traveling between two cities, given that there are two types of moves: a direct move to any city with a cost equal to the distance between the cities, or a move to the closest city with a fixed cost of 1 coin.

The program first reads the input and processes each test case. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the number of cities `n` and their coordinates in ascending order.
2. Calls `func_1` to determine the closest city for each city and the cost of moving to the closest city.
3. Computes the prefix sums for both forward and backward movements.
4. Processes each query by calculating the minimum cost based on the prefix sums.

The function `func_1` calculates the cost of moving to the closest city for each city. It does this by:
- Iterating through the list of cities.
- For each city, it checks the distance to the next city and the previous city.
- If the distance to the next city is smaller, the cost is set to 1 (indicating a move to the closest city).
- Otherwise, the cost is set to the distance to the next city.

The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are used to quickly calculate the cumulative cost of moving from one city to another using the closest city moves.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the program. The function `func_1` does not correctly determine the closest city for each city and the corresponding cost of moving to the closest city. Specifically:
- The function does not handle the case where the closest city is the previous city correctly.
- The function incorrectly sets the cost to 1 for the last city in the list, which is not necessarily the closest city.

Given the provided example and the logic of the function, the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all queries. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
