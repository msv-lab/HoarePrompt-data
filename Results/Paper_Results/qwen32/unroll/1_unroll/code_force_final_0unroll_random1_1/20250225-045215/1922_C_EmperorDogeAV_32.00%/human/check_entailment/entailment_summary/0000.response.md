### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum cost to travel between cities using two types of moves: moving to the closest city for 1 coin or moving to any other city for the distance between the cities in coins. The given program processes each test case by first identifying the closest city for each city and then calculating prefix sums to efficiently answer multiple queries.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case:
     - The number of cities `n` is read.
     - The coordinates of the cities are read and converted to integers.
     - The number of queries `m` is read.
     - The queries are read, each consisting of two city indices.

2. **Determine Closest Cities:**
   - The `func_1` function is called twice:
     - Once with the cities in their original order to determine the closest city for each city when moving forward.
     - Once with the cities in reverse order to determine the closest city for each city when moving backward.
   - The `func_1` function computes the cost to move to the next city or the closest city for each city, based on the problem's conditions.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - Prefix sums are calculated for both the forward and backward directions to enable efficient query processing.
   - `pref_sum_f` stores the cumulative cost to move from the first city to each subsequent city using the closest city rule.
   - `pref_sum_b` stores the cumulative cost to move from the last city to each preceding city using the closest city rule.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines whether to use the forward or backward prefix sums based on the relative positions of the cities.
   - The difference in prefix sums gives the minimum cost to travel between the two cities.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of `func_1`:**
  - The function correctly identifies whether to move to the next city or the closest city based on the given conditions.
  - The function handles edge cases, such as the first and last cities, correctly.

- **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
  - The prefix sums are calculated correctly, allowing for efficient query processing.
  - The forward and backward prefix sums are used appropriately based on the relative positions of the cities in the queries.

- **Query Processing:**
  - The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each query by leveraging the precomputed prefix sums.
  - The logic ensures that the minimum cost is computed efficiently, even for large inputs.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**
