Precondition: **cities is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order. n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities in each test case. Additionally, each test case includes m queries, where m is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) representing the number of queries, followed by m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost is to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
