You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order. n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities in each test case. Additionally, each test case includes m queries, where m is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) representing the number of queries, followed by m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost is to be calculated.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Here are a few issues and a counterexample to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**: The function `func_1` calculates the closest city incorrectly. It only checks the immediate neighbors and does not properly determine the closest city for each city. For example, if the cities are `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`, the closest city to city 1 (0) should be city 2 (8), but the function may not correctly determine this for all cases.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Prefix Sums**: The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated using the incorrect values from `func_1`. Since `func_1` is not correctly identifying the closest cities, the prefix sums will be incorrect, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

3. **Handling of Queries**: The program assumes that the cost to travel between cities can be calculated using the prefix sums derived from the incorrect closest city calculations. This will result in incorrect minimum coin calculations for the queries.

### Counterexample

Consider the input:

```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output is:

```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the provided program will likely produce incorrect results due to the issues mentioned above.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve this problem, we need to:

1. Determine the closest city for each city correctly.
2. Use these closest cities to calculate the minimum cost to travel between any two cities.
3. Handle the queries efficiently using these precomputed values.

Given the complexity of the problem, the provided program does not meet these requirements and thus is incorrect.
