cities is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order. The next integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) represents the number of queries, followed by m pairs of integers x_i and y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost needs to be calculated. The function is called with a single argument 'cities' which contains all the test cases. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
