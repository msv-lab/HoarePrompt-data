Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the edges of the tree, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node of the stone. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input; `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory; `rev` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**

Explanation: The code snippet only initializes a new defaultdict named `rev` with list as the default factory. No other variables are affected, and the initial state of all other variables remains unchanged.
