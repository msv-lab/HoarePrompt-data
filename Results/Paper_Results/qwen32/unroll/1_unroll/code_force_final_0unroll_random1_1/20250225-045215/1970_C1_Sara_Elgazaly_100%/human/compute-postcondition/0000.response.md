The provided Python code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to the variables `x` and `y`. This operation does not affect the initial state of `n`, `t`, the edges of the tree, or the starting node `u_1`. 

After executing the code, `x` and `y` will hold the integer values from the input line.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer and t=1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the edges of the tree, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node of the stone. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.**
