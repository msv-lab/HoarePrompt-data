This input-output description does not match the function definition `def add(a, b):`. However, based on the problem description, the input values are as follows: N and M are integers representing the dimensions of the field (3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99, and both are odd). The field is represented by a list of N strings, each containing M pairs of characters separated by spaces, where each pair can be "..", "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9", "RG", "BG", ".Q", or ".B". T is an integer representing the number of steps in the game (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000). The next T lines each describe an action with a pair of characters representing the entity performing the action, followed by a space and a character representing the action ("U", "D", "L", "R", "C", or "T"). If the action is "C", it is followed by a space and a pair of characters representing the ball being caught.
