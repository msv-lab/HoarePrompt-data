Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can interactively query up to 3n times per test case by providing four indices a, b, c, d (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n) to receive a comparison result of (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d). The goal is to determine any pair of indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    k = 1
    for i in range(2, n):
        print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            k = i
    best = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            best = i
    print('!', k, best, flush=True)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
