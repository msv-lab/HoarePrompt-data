The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This means the values of `n` and `m` will be updated based on the input provided, while `x` and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the two integers provided by the input; `x` is 1; `cnt` is 0.**
