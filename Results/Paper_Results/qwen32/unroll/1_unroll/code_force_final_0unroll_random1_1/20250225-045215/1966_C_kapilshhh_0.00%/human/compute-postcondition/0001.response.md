To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition `tc > 0`. The variable `t` is given as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but it is not directly involved in the loop condition. The only variable in the loop head is `tc`.

Given that the loop condition is `tc > 0`, `tc` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Since `tc` is an input integer, we need to ensure that its value satisfies the condition `tc > 0`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `tc` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `tc` must be greater than 0**
