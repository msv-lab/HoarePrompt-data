You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates a value based on these counts and prints the result. The final state of the program is that it outputs the calculated value for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on a sequence of integers where each integer is between 0 and 4.
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.
- Eve removes one number at a time from the sequence until it is empty.
- We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

### Key Observations:
- XOR of a sequence is zero if and only if the count of each number contributing to the XOR bits is even.
- The sequence consists of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- The binary representations are:
  - 1: `01`
  - 2: `10`
  - 3: `11`
  - 4: `100`

### Strategy:
- To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should try to keep the XOR of the sequence zero for as many rounds as possible.
- This involves removing numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence has an even count of numbers contributing to each bit position.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
The provided code is as follows:
```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x // 2)
        print(cnt)


```

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Handling of Number 4**:
   - The code does not specifically handle the number 4, which contributes to the highest bit position. This is a critical oversight because the presence of an odd count of 4s can affect the overall XOR result.
   
2. **General XOR Logic**:
   - The logic of the code does not correctly account for the XOR properties of the numbers. The condition `if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1` is not a general solution for determining when Bob can win. It only covers a very specific and limited case.

3. **Counting Bob's Wins**:
   - The loop `for x in a: cnt += math.floor(x // 2)` is intended to count pairs of numbers, but it does not consider the bitwise contributions correctly and does not account for the optimal removal strategy by Eve.

### Example to Demonstrate Incorrectness:
Consider the input:
```
1
1 1 1 1
```
- The sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- XOR of `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 = 4` (non-zero), so Alice wins initially.
- If Eve removes `1`, the sequence is `[2, 3, 4]` and XOR is `2 ^ 3 ^ 4 = 5` (non-zero), so Alice wins.
- If Eve removes `2`, the sequence is `[1, 3, 4]` and XOR is `1 ^ 3 ^ 4 = 6` (non-zero), so Alice wins.
- If Eve removes `3`, the sequence is `[1, 2, 4]` and XOR is `1 ^ 2 ^ 4 = 7` (non-zero), so Alice wins.
- If Eve removes `4`, the sequence is `[1, 2, 3]` and XOR is `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0` (zero), so Bob wins.
- The correct answer should be `1` (Bob wins once).

However, the provided code will output `2` for this case:
- `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]` is not true.
- `cnt += math.floor(x // 2)` will sum up to `2` (0 from 1, 0 from 1, 0 from 1, 0 from 1).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win for every potential case.

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation:
The code fails to correctly account for the bitwise contributions of each number and the optimal removal strategy by Eve. It does not handle the number 4 correctly and does not provide a general solution for determining when Bob can win.
