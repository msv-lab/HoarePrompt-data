To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the given loop and the conditions.

The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n-1` (inclusive). For each iteration `i`, the function `func_1` is called with the arguments `0, max_index, 0, i`. The result of `func_1` is then compared to the string `'<'`. If the result is `'<'`, the variable `max_index` is updated to the current value of `i`.

Given that we do not have the implementation details of `func_1`, we can infer the behavior based on the typical usage of such a function. A common pattern is that `func_1` might compare the current index `i` with `max_index` and return `'<'` if `i` is less than `max_index` or some condition based on these indices is met.

However, since `max_index` is initialized to `0` and does not change in any way that would make it greater than `i` in subsequent iterations (as `i` increases from `0` to `n-1`), and assuming `func_1` is designed to return `'<'` when `i` is greater than `max_index`, the condition `res == '<'` will be true for all `i` from `1` to `n-1` (since `0` is not greater than `0`).

Thus, `max_index` will be updated to the last value of `i` for which `res == '<'` is true, which is `n-1`.

Output State: **`max_index` is `n-1`.**
