You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` takes no arguments but operates on input provided through standard input. The input begins with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99) representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively, for that test case.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        
        print(z)
        
    #State: A series of integers, each representing the computed value of `z` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` takes no arguments but reads from standard input. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively. For each test case, the function calculates and returns the total area covered by the icons.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
