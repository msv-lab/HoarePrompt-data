The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the variable `a` which determines the number of iterations. To ensure that the loop executes, `a` must be at least 1. The variable `i` is the loop counter and does not need to be set before the loop starts since it will be initialized by the `range` function. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `a` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`a` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not set before the loop starts**
