To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the operations performed inside the loop for each test case. The loop processes `a` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y`. The operations inside the loop compute a value `z` and print it. Here's a breakdown of the operations:

1. **Read Input**: For each test case, read two integers `x` and `y`.
2. **Compute `z`**: Calculate `z` as `(y + 1) // 2`. This essentially computes the minimum number of 2x2 grid units required to place `y` 2x2 icons, rounding up.
3. **Compute `m`**: Calculate `m` as `15 * z - y * 4`. This computes the remaining space in a 15x15 grid after placing the 2x2 icons.
4. **Adjust `z` if Necessary**: If `m` is less than `a` (the total number of test cases), adjust `z` by adding the necessary number of additional 2x2 grid units to fit the remaining 1x1 icons. This is done using the formula `z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`.
5. **Print `z`**: Print the final value of `z` for the current test case.

Given that the loop processes each test case independently and the state of variables `a`, `x`, and `y` changes with each iteration, the output state will be a series of printed values of `z` for each test case.

Since the loop does not modify the global state (other than the variables within its scope), and the output is determined solely by the input values, the output state can be described as a sequence of integers printed for each test case.

Output State: **A series of integers, each representing the computed value of `z` for each test case.**
