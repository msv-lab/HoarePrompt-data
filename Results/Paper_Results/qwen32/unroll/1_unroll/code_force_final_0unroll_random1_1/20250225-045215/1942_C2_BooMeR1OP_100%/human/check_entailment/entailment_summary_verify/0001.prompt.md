You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` that is determined by the gaps between the integers in the list and the value of `y`. The function does not modify the input values but uses them to compute and output a result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed in a regular polygon with `n` sides, given `x` vertices already chosen by Bessie and the possibility to choose up to `y` more vertices.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the list of `x` vertices chosen by Bessie.
   - It converts the vertices to 0-based indexing by subtracting 1 from each vertex.
   - It initializes `ans` to `x - 2` because, with `x` vertices, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed without any additional vertices is `x - 2`.

2. **Counting Initial Triangles**:
   - It iterates through the sorted list of vertices and checks for potential additional triangles that can be formed with the vertices already chosen.
   - If a vertex `a[i]` has a neighboring vertex `a[i] + 2` (considering the polygon's circular nature) that is also chosen, but `a[i] + 1` is not, it increments `ans` by 1.

3. **Handling Gaps**:
   - It calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and categorizes them into odd and even gaps.
   - For each odd gap, it tries to fill the gap with additional vertices to form more triangles. If there are not enough additional vertices (`y`), it uses as many as possible.
   - The same process is repeated for even gaps.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints the calculated maximum number of triangles.

However, there are several issues with this approach:

- The logic for counting initial triangles is flawed. The check `(t1 not in st and t2 in st)` does not correctly identify when additional triangles can be formed.
- The handling of gaps is overly simplistic and does not correctly account for all possible ways to maximize the number of triangles.
- The program does not correctly handle the constraints and edge cases, such as when `y` is zero or when the gaps are very large.

Given the complexity of the problem and the potential for edge cases, the provided program does not guarantee the correct solution for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
