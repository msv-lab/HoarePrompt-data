The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This means that the initial state where `a` was a list of integers with length `n` is replaced by a new list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is the integer value provided as input.**
This output state reflects that `a` has been updated to a new list of integers based on the input, while `n` remains the integer value provided as input, representing the length of the new list `a`.
