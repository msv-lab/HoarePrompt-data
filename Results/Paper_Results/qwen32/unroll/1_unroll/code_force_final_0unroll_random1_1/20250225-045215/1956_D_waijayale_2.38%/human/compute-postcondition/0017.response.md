Functionality: **The function `recursive_maximize_sum` modifies the array `a` by setting elements within a specified subarray range `[l, r]` to a specific value based on a condition. If the sum of the elements in the subarray is less than or equal to the square of the subarray's length, all elements in that subarray are set to the length of the subarray. Otherwise, the function recursively processes subarrays divided by the maximum element's position within the current range. The function also appends operations to the list `ops` when modifying the array.**
