To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to understand what the loop does and how it affects the variables involved. The loop iterates over each pair `(l, r)` in the `ops` list and prints `l + 1` and `r + 1`.

Given:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is an integer.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the return values of `func_2(a)`.
- The loop iterates over `ops` and prints `l + 1` and `r + 1` for each pair `(l, r)`.

The loop itself does not modify any variables outside its body or the loop head. It only performs print operations. Therefore, the values of `a`, `n`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the same list of integers, `n` is the same integer, `s` is the same first return value of `func_2(a)`, `m` is the same second return value of `func_2(a)`, `ops` is the same list of pairs.**
