Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r <= n, where n is the length of the array `a`. If the sum `s` of the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` is less than or equal to (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` are all set to the value (r - l + 1). Otherwise, `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), `mx` is the maximum value in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`, and `pos` is the index of `mx` in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`. Additionally, if `pos` is not equal to `l`, then `pos` is not equal to `l`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the current value of `pos` remains unchanged. All other variables, including `l`, `r`, `s`, and `ops`, remain unchanged unless specified.**
