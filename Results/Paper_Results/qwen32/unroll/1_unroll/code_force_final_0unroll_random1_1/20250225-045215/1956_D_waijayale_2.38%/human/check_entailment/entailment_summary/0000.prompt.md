Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_3()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0
        return
    func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
    if a[l] != r - l + 1:
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function modifies a list of integers `a` within a specified range from index `l` to `r` by setting elements to a specific value if they do not meet a condition. It also records these modifications in the list `ops`. The function does not return any value.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []

    recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)
    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts a list `a` of integers, where each integer is in the range 0 to 10^7 inclusive, and the length of the list `a` is between 1 and 18. It returns a tuple containing the sum of all integers in the list `a`, the integer 0, and an empty list.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
    else:
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if pos != l:
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        if pos != r:
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `recursive_maximize_sum` modifies the array `a` by setting elements within a specified subarray range `[l, r]` to a specific value based on a condition. If the sum of the elements in the subarray is less than or equal to the square of the subarray's length, all elements in that subarray are set to the length of the subarray. Otherwise, the function recursively processes subarrays divided by the maximum element's position within the current range. The function also appends operations to the list `ops` when modifying the array.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the input, processes the list using `func_2`, and prints the sum `s` and maximum `m` of the list, followed by a series of operations `ops`. The list `a` and the integer `n` remain unchanged after the function concludes.
