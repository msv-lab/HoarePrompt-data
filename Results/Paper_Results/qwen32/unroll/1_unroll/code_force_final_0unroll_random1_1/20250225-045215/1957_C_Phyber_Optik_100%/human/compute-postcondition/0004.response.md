Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5. The function does not accept additional parameters `k` or `r_i` and `c_i` as described in the context. Based on the provided output, it seems there might be a discrepancy in the function definition and the description. Given the current function definition, it is expected to return a value or perform an operation based solely on `n`. However, with the current information, the functionality is not fully clear. If the function were to be defined with all parameters as described, it would accept `t` test cases, each with an integer `n` and `k` moves, and for each move, two integers `r_i` and `c_i`. The function would then perform operations based on these inputs. Since the function is defined with only `n`, it is not possible to determine the exact functionality without additional context. Assuming the function is meant to operate with all parameters, the functionality would involve processing `n` and the subsequent moves to return a specific result for each test case.**
