Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. The function `func_1` is called before it is defined, which will result in a `NameError`.

2. The dynamic programming array `dp` is not being used correctly. The logic for computing the number of configurations is not correctly implemented. The formula used in `func_1` does not match the problem's requirements.

3. The way the `invalid` set is used is incorrect. The `invalid` set should track both rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks, but the current implementation adds both `r` and `c` to the set without distinguishing between them, which can lead to incorrect results.

4. The final result is computed using `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, but this does not correctly account for the mirrored moves and the special case when `r == c`.

5. The problem requires that the result is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is correctly handled in the `func_1` function, but the overall logic needs to be corrected.

A correct implementation would involve a more complex approach to handle the mirrored moves and the constraints of the problem, possibly using combinatorial mathematics or dynamic programming with a more accurate state representation.
