You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, representing the i-th move you made. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: The `dp` array is fully computed from `dp[1]` to `dp[n]` using the provided recurrence relation. The specific values of `dp[3]` to `dp[n]` depend on the value of `n` and are calculated as follows:
    #- `dp[1]` remains 1.
    #- `dp[2]` remains 3.
    #- For `i` from 3 to `n`, `dp[i]` is calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.
    #The values of `r_i` and `c_i` provided in the input do not affect the computation of the `dp` array in this loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5. The function does not accept additional parameters `k` or `r_i` and `c_i` as described in the context. Based on the provided output, it seems there might be a discrepancy in the function definition and the description. Given the current function definition, it is expected to return a value or perform an operation based solely on `n`. However, with the current information, the functionality is not fully clear. If the function were to be defined with all parameters as described, it would accept `t` test cases, each with an integer `n` and `k` moves, and for each move, two integers `r_i` and `c_i`. The function would then perform operations based on these inputs. Since the function is defined with only `n`, it is not possible to determine the exact functionality without additional context. Assuming the function is meant to operate with all parameters, the functionality would involve processing `n` and the subsequent moves to return a specific result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
