### Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem by calculating the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after `k` moves, using dynamic programming. The function `func_1` computes the number of valid configurations for a given `n` using a specific recurrence relation. However, there are several issues with the implementation that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Initialization and Usage of `dp` Array:**
   - The `dp` array is initialized up to an index of `300006` (based on the length of the list), but the function `func_1` is called with `300000` as an argument. This suggests that the `dp` array is intended to store precomputed values for the number of configurations for different sizes of the board up to `300000`.
   - However, the `dp` array is not correctly utilized in the main part of the program. After computing the `dp` values, the program calculates the number of invalid rows and columns based on the moves made and then tries to use `dp[n - len(invalid)]`. This approach assumes that the number of remaining valid positions (after accounting for the invalid ones) can be directly used to index into the `dp` array, which is incorrect.

2. **Handling of Invalid Rows and Columns:**
   - The program uses a set `invalid` to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. However, it adds both `r` and `c` to the set, which is not accurate. The set should only contain unique rows and columns that are invalid, not both `r` and `c` for each move.

3. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - The recurrence relation used in `func_1` is not directly related to the problem of placing rooks on a chessboard. The relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` does not correctly model the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board while ensuring no two rooks attack each other.

4. **Logic for Final Configurations:**
   - The final number of configurations is not correctly calculated. The program attempts to use `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which does not account for the mirrored moves and the specific constraints of the problem.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the logic and the way the `dp` array is used, the provided program is incorrect for solving the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
