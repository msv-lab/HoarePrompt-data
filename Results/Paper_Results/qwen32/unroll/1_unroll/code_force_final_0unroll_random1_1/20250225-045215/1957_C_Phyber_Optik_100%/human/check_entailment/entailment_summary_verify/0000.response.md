### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the provided program and the original assessment based on the problem description and function summary.

1. **Initialization and Use of `dp` Array**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized with a size of 300007. The function `func_1` is intended to populate this array using a specific recurrence relation.
   - The function `func_1` is called with an argument of 300000 before it's defined in the provided code. This will indeed result in an error. The function `func_1` should be defined before it is called.
   - The `dp` array is supposed to store the number of configurations for a given number of free rows/columns. The function `func_1` is correctly defined to populate this array based on the recurrence relation provided.

2. **Handling of Invalid Rows and Columns**:
   - The program uses a set `invalid` to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. However, it adds both `r` and `c` to the same set, which is incorrect. The program should maintain separate sets for rows and columns that are already occupied.
   - The program calculates the number of free rows/columns by subtracting the length of the `invalid` set from `n`. This is incorrect because the `invalid` set will contain both row and column indices, leading to an incorrect count of free rows/columns.
   - The correct approach would be to maintain separate sets for rows and columns, and then compute the number of free rows and columns as `n - len(rows_set)` and `n - len(columns_set)`, respectively.

3. **Dynamic Programming Formula**:
   - The formula used in the dynamic programming approach seems to be correct for the problem of counting the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a board with a given number of free rows and columns. The formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is intended to account for the number of ways to place rooks on a board with `i` free rows/columns.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle the mirroring rule and the specific constraints of the problem.

4. **Mirroring Rule**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the mirroring rule. If a player places a rook at `(r, c)`, the computer should place a rook at `(c, r)`, except when `r = c`. The program does not implement this rule correctly, leading to incorrect results.
   - The program should update the sets of occupied rows and columns correctly to account for the mirroring rule.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where `k = 0` or `k = n` correctly. When `k = 0`, the board is completely free, and the number of configurations should be based on the size of the board. When `k = n`, there are no more valid moves, and the number of configurations should be 1 if the board is fully occupied without conflicts.
   - The program does not account for these edge cases correctly.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 0
```
The program should output `36` (since there are 4 rows and 4 columns, and each row and column can be independently chosen for placing rooks). However, the program will not produce the correct result due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program has several issues, including incorrect handling of invalid rows and columns, incorrect implementation of the mirroring rule, and incorrect handling of edge cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
