To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand what the code does in each iteration. Here's a breakdown of the loop:

1. **Input Reading**: For each test case, the code reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **List Construction (`L`)**: It constructs a list `L` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 2 (rounding up) and subtracting the result from `n` until `n` becomes 0. Each result is appended to the list `L`.

3. **Calculation of Output**:
   - It initializes `tot` to 0 and `pow` to 1.
   - It iterates through the list `L`. For each element `a` in `L`, it checks if `k` falls within the range `(tot, tot + a]`.
   - If `k` is within this range, it prints a value calculated as `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - It then updates `tot` by adding `a` and `pow` by multiplying it by 2.

The output of the code is a series of integers, one for each test case, based on the above logic.

**Output State**: After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` will have their final values from the last test case processed. The list `L` will be empty as it is re-initialized for each test case. The variables `tot` and `pow` will also be reset after each test case. The only persistent output is the series of integers printed for each test case.

Given the nature of the problem, the output state in terms of variables will be as follows:

- `t` will be the number of test cases processed.
- `n` and `k` will be the values from the last test case.
- `L` will be an empty list.
- `tot` and `pow` will be 0 and 1 respectively, as they are reset at the start of each test case.

However, the primary output is the series of printed integers, which is not stored in any variable but is the result of the function.

Thus, the output state in terms of variables is:

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `n` and `k` are the values from the last test case, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, and `pow` is 1.**
