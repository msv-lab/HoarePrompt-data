Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly maximize the product of the two numbers by optimally swapping their digits. The current logic does not consider the best possible swaps to maximize the product, but rather it performs a simple comparison and swap from the first differing digit onward, which does not guarantee an optimal solution.

To maximize the product, a more strategic approach is needed, such as sorting the digits of each number and then greedily matching the largest available digits from one number with the largest available digits from the other number, or using a dynamic programming approach to explore possible swaps.

Here is a corrected version of the function that uses a greedy approach:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, list(input())))
        b = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        # Sort digits in descending order
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        b.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Greedily match the largest digits
        new_a = []
        new_b = []
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                new_a.append(a[i])
                new_b.append(b[i])
            else:
                new_a.append(b[i])
                new_b.append(a[i])
        
        print(''.join(map(str, new_a)))
        print(''.join(map(str, new_b)))

# Example usage
func()
```

This version sorts the digits of each number in descending order and then greedily matches the largest available digits, which helps in maximizing the product of the two numbers.
