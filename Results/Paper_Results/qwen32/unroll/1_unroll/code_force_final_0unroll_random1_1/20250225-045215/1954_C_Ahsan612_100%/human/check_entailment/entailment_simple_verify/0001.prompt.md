You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

    #State: For each test case, two numbers are printed: one formed by the list `new` and one formed by the list `new2`, as described by the logic of the loop. The state of `t`, `x`, and `y` remains unchanged except for their values being consumed by the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap
The task is to maximize the product of two integers `x` and `y` by swapping corresponding digits between them. The program should output the modified `x` and `y` after performing the operations.

### Program Analysis
The program follows these steps:
1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`.
2. **Conversion to Lists**: Both `x` and `y` are converted to lists of integers for easier manipulation.
3. **Initialization**: Two new lists `new` and `new2` of the same length as `x` and `y` are initialized to store the final digits of `x` and `y`.
4. **Digit Comparison and Swapping**:
   - It iterates through the digits of `x` and `y` from left to right.
   - If the digits at the current position are the same (`a[i] == b[i]`), it assigns the same digit to both `new[i]` and `new2[i]`.
   - If the digits are different, it assigns the maximum digit to `new[i]` and the minimum digit to `new2[i]` for the first position where they differ.
   - For all subsequent positions, it assigns the minimum digit to `new[i]` and the maximum digit to `new2[i]`.
5. **Output**: It converts the lists `new` and `new2` back to strings and prints them.

### Correctness Analysis
To maximize the product of `x` and `y`, the goal is to maximize the significant digits of both numbers. The program's approach of swapping digits to make one number as large as possible and the other as small as possible from the first differing position onwards is correct. However, there are a few considerations:
- **Handling Identical Digits**: The program correctly handles cases where the digits are the same by keeping them unchanged.
- **Swapping Strategy**: The strategy of maximizing the significant digits from the first differing position onwards is optimal for maximizing the product.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as all digits being the same or one number being larger than the other.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping digits. It handles all specified cases and adheres to the problem requirements.
