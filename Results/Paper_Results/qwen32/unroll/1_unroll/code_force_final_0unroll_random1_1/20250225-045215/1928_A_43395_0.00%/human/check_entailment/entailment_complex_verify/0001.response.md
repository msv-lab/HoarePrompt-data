### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the given program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Understanding:
Bob can cut his rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. He then tries to form a new rectangle using the two smaller rectangles. The key point is that the new rectangle must have different dimensions than the original one (considering rotations as the same).

**Key Observations:**
- If either dimension is 1, Bob cannot form a different rectangle because the only possible smaller rectangles would be 1x1, and no new rectangle can be formed.
- If both dimensions are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle (e.g., from 2x4, cut into two 2x2, form 4x2).
- If one dimension is even and the other is odd, Bob can form a new rectangle (e.g., from 2x3, cut into two 2x1.5, form 3x2).
- If both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form a different rectangle because the resulting smaller rectangles will be of the form odd x 1, and no new rectangle can be formed that is different from the original.

#### Code Analysis:
Let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

- The first condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` correctly identifies that if both dimensions are even, Bob can form a new rectangle.
- The second condition `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is incorrect. It seems to be trying to check if the dimensions are the same, but the logic is flawed. This condition doesn't correctly handle the case where both dimensions are odd, which should result in "no". The condition `(a - b == -a, a)` is a tuple and always evaluates to `True` because it is a non-empty tuple.
- The third condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is incorrect. It will always evaluate to true for any non-zero difference between a and b because `(a - b) % 2` will either be 1 or -1, which is neither > 0 nor < 0 in the way intended. The condition should check if the difference is non-zero, i.e., `(a - b) != 0`.
- The `else` condition is a fallback, but due to the incorrect conditions above, it may not be reached correctly.

#### Correct Conditions:
- If both dimensions are even, print "yes".
- If both dimensions are odd, print "no".
- If one dimension is even and the other is odd, print "yes".

The correct code should be:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

This code correctly handles all the cases as per the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate in identifying that the provided code is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the second and third conditions. The correct conditions should be based on whether at least one of the dimensions is even.

**Final: False**
