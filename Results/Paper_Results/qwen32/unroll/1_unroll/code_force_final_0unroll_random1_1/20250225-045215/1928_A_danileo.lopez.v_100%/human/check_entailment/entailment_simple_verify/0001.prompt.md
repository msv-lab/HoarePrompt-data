You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Input

    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

The state of `t` and any other variables not involved in the loop body will remain the same as the initial state.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob starts with a rectangle of size a x b. He wants to cut it into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. Then, he wants to form another rectangle from these two smaller rectangles. If the new rectangle is different from the original one (considering 90° rotations as the same rectangle), he succeeds.

### Key Observations:
1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a different rectangle. This is because cutting an odd-sized side in half results in non-integer sides, and cutting an odd-sized rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides would result in two rectangles of the same dimensions as the original (rotated), which do not form a different rectangle.
2. If either `a` or `b` (or both) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a different rectangle. For example, if `a` is even, he can cut it into two rectangles of size `a/2 x b`, which can be rearranged into a rectangle of size `a x (b/2)`.

### Program Analysis:
The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If so, it checks if the resulting rectangles after the cut are different from the original rectangle (ignoring rotations). If they are different, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". If both `a` and `b` are odd, it directly prints "No".

### Detailed Steps of the Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.
3. **Check Evenness**:
   - If `a` is even, it cuts the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles. If `a/2` is not equal to `b`, it prints "Yes".
   - If `b` is even, it cuts the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles. If `b/2` is not equal to `a`, it prints "Yes".
   - If neither `a` nor `b` is even, it prints "No".

### Correctness Evaluation:
The program correctly identifies when Bob can form a different rectangle and when he cannot, based on the evenness of the dimensions. Specifically:
- It correctly handles the case where both `a` and `b` are odd by printing "No".
- It correctly handles the case where either `a` or `b` is even by checking if the resulting rectangles can form a different rectangle.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
