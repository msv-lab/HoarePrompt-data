### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The key observation here is that the only way to form a different rectangle after cutting is if the original rectangle can be divided into two equal parts along one of its sides such that the resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the provided code:

1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then iterates through each test case, reading the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) of each rectangle.
2. **Even Check**: The code checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even:
   - If \(a\) is even, it can be divided into two equal parts of size \(a/2 \times b\). To form a different rectangle, \(a/2\) should not be equal to \(b\).
   - If \(b\) is even, it can be divided into two equal parts of size \(a \times b/2\). To form a different rectangle, \(b/2\) should not be equal to \(a\).
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, the code checks both conditions and prints "Yes" if either condition is satisfied.
3. **Odd Check**: If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it is impossible to divide the rectangle into two equal parts along either side, so the code prints "No".

The code correctly captures the logic needed to determine if a different rectangle can be formed. It checks the necessary conditions for each test case and outputs the correct result.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it and rearranging the resulting pieces.
