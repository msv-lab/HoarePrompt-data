The code snippet provided is `t = int(input())`. This line reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. After executing this line, `t` will hold the value of the integer input provided by the user, which will still fall within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. The information about the test cases and the strings `s` remains unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each of the t test cases, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.**
