You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a binary string. For each string, it calculates the number of segments of consecutive identical characters and subtracts one if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1'. The result for each test case is printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the given program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) a binary string can be cut into such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Key Observations

1. **Transition Points:** The critical points in the string are where a '0' is immediately followed by a '1'. This is because these are the points where the sorted order is violated.
2. **Counting Pieces:** Each time a transition from '0' to '1' is encountered, it suggests that the string should be cut at that point to ensure that the '0's can be rearranged before the '1's.
3. **Edge Cases:** Strings that are already sorted (all '0's or all '1's) should return 1 as they don't need any cuts.

### Program Analysis

The given program uses a `count` variable to keep track of the number of pieces needed, starting at 1 (since at least one piece is always needed). It iterates through the string and increments `count` every time it encounters a transition from '0' to '1' or from '1' to '0'. However, the program then decrements `count` if a '0' to '1' transition is found, which seems incorrect.

### Correctness Check

Let's analyze the program with the given test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:** `11010`
   - Transitions: `1->0`, `0->1`, `1->0`
   - Count: 4 (initial 1 + 3 transitions) - 1 (for the '0->1' transition) = 3
   - Correct Output: 3

2. **Test Case 2:** `00000000`
   - No transitions
   - Count: 1
   - Correct Output: 1

3. **Test Case 3:** `1`
   - No transitions
   - Count: 1
   - Correct Output: 1

4. **Test Case 4:** `10`
   - Transitions: `1->0`
   - Count: 2 (initial 1 + 1 transition) - 1 (for the '1->0' transition) = 1
   - Incorrect Output: 1 (should be 2)

5. **Test Case 5:** `0001111`
   - No transitions from '0' to '1'
   - Count: 1
   - Correct Output: 1

6. **Test Case 6:** `0110`
   - Transitions: `0->1`, `1->0`
   - Count: 3 (initial 1 + 2 transitions) - 1 (for the '0->1' transition) = 2
   - Correct Output: 2

### Conclusion

The program fails for the test case `10` where it should output `2` but outputs `1`. This is because the logic of decrementing `count` if a '0' to '1' transition is found is incorrect. The program should simply count the number of transitions and add 1 to get the correct number of pieces.

Correctness: **False**
