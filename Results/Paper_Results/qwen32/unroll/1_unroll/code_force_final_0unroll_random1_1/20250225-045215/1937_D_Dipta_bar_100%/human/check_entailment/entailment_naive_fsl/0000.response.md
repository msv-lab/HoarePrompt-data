Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` is complex and does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the rules provided. The code attempts to calculate the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position, but it does not correctly handle the inversion of the characters and the movement rules.

Let's analyze the code with a simple test case:

#### Test Case:
```
1
3
><<
```

#### Expected Output:
```
3 6 5
```

#### Explanation of Expected Output:
- For the first position (index 0):
  - Pinball moves right to position 1 (1 second).
  - Character at position 1 changes from '>' to '<'.
  - Pinball moves left to position 0 (2 seconds).
  - Character at position 0 changes from '>' to '<'.
  - Pinball moves left out of the grid (3 seconds).

- For the second position (index 1):
  - Pinball moves left to position 0 (1 second).
  - Character at position 0 changes from '<' to '>'.
  - Pinball moves right to position 1 (2 seconds).
  - Character at position 1 changes from '<' to '>'.
  - Pinball moves right to position 2 (3 seconds).
  - Character at position 2 changes from '<' to '>'.
  - Pinball moves right out of the grid (6 seconds).

- For the third position (index 2):
  - Pinball moves left to position 1 (1 second).
  - Character at position 1 changes from '>' to '<'.
  - Pinball moves left to position 0 (2 seconds).
  - Character at position 0 changes from '>' to '<'.
  - Pinball moves left out of the grid (3 seconds).
  - Pinball moves right to position 1 (4 seconds).
  - Character at position 1 changes from '<' to '>'.
  - Pinball moves right to position 2 (5 seconds).
  - Character at position 2 changes from '<' to '>'.
  - Pinball moves right out of the grid (6 seconds).
  - Pinball moves left to position 1 (5 seconds).
  - Character at position 1 changes from '>' to '<'.
  - Pinball moves left to position 0 (6 seconds).
  - Character at position 0 changes from '>' to '<'.
  - Pinball moves left out of the grid (7 seconds).
  - Pinball moves right to position 1 (8 seconds).
  - Character at position 1 changes from '<' to '>'.
  - Pinball moves right to position 2 (9 seconds).
  - Character at position 2 changes from '<' to '>'.
  - Pinball moves right out of the grid (10 seconds).

However, the provided code does not correctly simulate this process, especially the inversion of characters and the movement rules. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

#### Example of Incorrect Output:
Given the test case `><<`, the code might output something like `3 6 5` which seems correct at first glance, but the logic behind it is flawed and might fail for more complex cases.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the problem description, and therefore, it is incorrect.
