The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing a sequence of directions for a pinball to traverse a grid. For each character in the string, the function calculates and prints the final position of the pinball after it follows the sequence of directions. The function handles multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by such a string `s`. The output is a series of integers, each representing the final position of the pinball for the corresponding character in the string.
