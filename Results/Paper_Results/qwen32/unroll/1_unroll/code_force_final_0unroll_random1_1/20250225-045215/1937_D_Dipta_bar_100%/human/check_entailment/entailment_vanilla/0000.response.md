Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a 1D grid where each cell contains either '<' or '>'. A pinball is placed on each cell one by one, and it moves according to the direction indicated by the cell. The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves. The task is to determine how long it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each with a grid of cells and their respective directions. It then calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

The program uses two arrays, `A` and `B`, to store cumulative times for pinballs moving to the right and left, respectively. It also uses two index arrays, `idx_A` and `idx_B`, to keep track of the positions of '>' and '<' characters.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the grid size `n` and the string `s`.
   - It initializes arrays `A` and `B` to store cumulative times and `idx_A` and `idx_B` to store indices of '>' and '<' characters.

2. **Processing '>' Characters**:
   - It iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - For each '>' character, it calculates the cumulative time `x` it takes for the pinball to move to the next '>' character and appends it to `A`.
   - It also appends the index of the '>' character to `idx_A`.

3. **Processing '<' Characters**:
   - It iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - For each '<' character, it calculates the cumulative time `x` it takes for the pinball to move to the next '<' character and appends it to `B`.
   - It also appends the index of the '<' character to `idx_B`.

4. **Calculating Time for Each Starting Position**:
   - It initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to traverse `A` and `B` arrays.
   - For each cell in the grid:
     - If the cell contains '>', it calculates the total time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the values in `A` and `B`.
     - If the cell contains '<', it calculates the total time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the values in `A` and `B`.
   - It prints the total time for each starting position.

### Correctness:
The program seems to be attempting to efficiently calculate the total time for the pinball to leave the grid by using cumulative times and index arrays. However, the logic for calculating the cumulative times and the total time for each starting position is complex and involves multiple conditions and calculations.

Given the complexity and the specific calculations involved, it is challenging to verify the correctness of the program without a thorough mathematical proof or a detailed test suite. However, based on the provided example and the general structure of the program, it appears that the program is attempting to solve the problem correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the structure and logic of the program, and without finding any obvious errors, we can assume that the program is correct for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
