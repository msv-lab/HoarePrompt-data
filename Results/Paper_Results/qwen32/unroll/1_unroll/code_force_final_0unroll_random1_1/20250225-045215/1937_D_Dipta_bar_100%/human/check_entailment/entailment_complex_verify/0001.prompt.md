You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing a sequence of directions for a pinball to traverse a grid. For each character in the string, the function calculates and prints the final position of the pinball after it follows the sequence of directions. The function handles multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by such a string `s`. The output is a series of integers, each representing the final position of the pinball for the corresponding character in the string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a 1D grid where each cell contains either '<' or '>'. A pinball is placed on each cell one by one, and it moves according to the direction indicated by the cell. The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves. The task is to determine how long it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each with a grid of cells and their respective directions. It then calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

The program uses two arrays, `A` and `B`, to store cumulative times for pinballs moving to the right and left, respectively. It also uses two index arrays, `idx_A` and `idx_B`, to keep track of the positions of '>' and '<' characters.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the grid size `n` and the string `s`.
   - It initializes arrays `A` and `B` to store cumulative times and `idx_A` and `idx_B` to store indices of '>' and '<' characters.

2. **Processing '>' Characters**:
   - It iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - For each '>' character, it calculates the cumulative time `x` it takes for the pinball to move to the next '>' character and appends it to `A`.
   - It also appends the index of the '>' character to `idx_A`.

3. **Processing '<' Characters**:
   - It iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - For each '<' character, it calculates the cumulative time `x` it takes for the pinball to move to the next '<' character and appends it to `B`.
   - It also appends the index of the '<' character to `idx_B`.

4. **Calculating Time for Each Starting Position**:
   - It initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to traverse `A` and `B` arrays.
   - For each cell in the grid:
     - If the cell contains '>', it calculates the total time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the values in `A` and `B`.
     - If the cell contains '<', it calculates the total time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the values in `A` and `B`.
   - It prints the total time for each starting position.

### Correctness:
The program seems to be attempting to efficiently calculate the total time for the pinball to leave the grid by using cumulative times and index arrays. However, the logic for calculating the cumulative times and the total time for each starting position is complex and involves multiple conditions and calculations.

Given the complexity and the specific calculations involved, it is challenging to verify the correctness of the program without a thorough mathematical proof or a detailed test suite. However, based on the provided example and the general structure of the program, it appears that the program is attempting to solve the problem correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the structure and logic of the program, and without finding any obvious errors, we can assume that the program is correct for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
