### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment to determine if the program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.

**Program Code:**
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        mn = min(a, b) + m
        if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1):
            print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)
        else:
            print(mn // a + mn // b)
```

**Annotated Code:**
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `a`, `b`, and `m`.
- It calculates `mn` as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.
- It then checks if `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b` and if neither `a` nor `b` is 1. If true, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`; otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`.

**Original Assessment:**
- The original assessment claims the program is incorrect due to improper overlap calculation and edge case handling.
- It provides a counterexample where the program fails to correctly determine the maximum number of visible fireworks.

**Evaluation:**

1. **Overlap Calculation:**
   - The program does not use the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine when fireworks from both installations coincide.
   - The LCM is crucial for correctly calculating the overlap of fireworks from both installations.

2. **Counterexample Analysis:**
   - Consider the counterexample provided in the original assessment:
     ```
     Input:
     1
     2 3 5
     ```
   - Expected Output: `4`
     - Fireworks from the first installation: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, ...
     - Fireworks from the second installation: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, ...
     - Maximum visible fireworks at the same time: 4 (at times 0, 5, 6, 12, 18).
   - Program Output: `6` (2 from the first installation + 4 from the second installation).
     - This is incorrect because it does not account for the overlap at times 0, 6, 12, and 18.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - The program's logic is flawed for general cases where fireworks from both installations can overlap in complex ways.
   - It does not handle cases where `a` and `b` are very large or when `m` is much larger than `a` and `b`.

**Conclusion:**
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. It fails to account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations and does not handle edge cases properly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
