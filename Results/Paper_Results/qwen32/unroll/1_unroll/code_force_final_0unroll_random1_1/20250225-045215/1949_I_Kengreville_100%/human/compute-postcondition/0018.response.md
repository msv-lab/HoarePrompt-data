Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. It operates based on predefined global variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`. The function returns no explicit value (None). It likely performs some operation involving the disks defined by their centers (`x`, `y`) and radii (`r`), possibly marking disks as visited (`visited`) and calculating or storing coefficients (`coef`).**
