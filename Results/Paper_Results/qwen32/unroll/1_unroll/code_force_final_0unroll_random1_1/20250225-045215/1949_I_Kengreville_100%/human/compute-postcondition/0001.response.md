The code snippet `x = [None] * n` reassigns the variable `x` to be a new list of size `n` where all elements are `None`. This overwrites the previous list `x` that contained integer coordinates.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input, `x` is a list of size `n` with all elements `None`, `y` and `r` are lists of integers where `y[i]` are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and `r[i]` is the radius of the i-th disk with -10^9 <= `y[i]` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `r[i]` <= 10^9 for each i from 0 to n-1; `visited` and `coef` are lists of size `n` initialized to `False` and `None` respectively.**
