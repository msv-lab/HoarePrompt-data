test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, cells) such that n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells, and cells is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) where a_i = 0 means the i-th cell is free and a_i = 1 means the i-th cell contains a chip. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
