You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze the problem statement and the provided code. The problem requires us to perform a series of swap operations on an array and then find the position of the element 1 after all operations are completed.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Initial Setup**: The array is initialized such that `a_i = i` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.

2. **Swap Operation**: For each `i` from 2 to `n`, the operation `swap(i)` is performed. This operation swaps the elements `a_d` and `a_k` where `d` is the largest divisor of `k` other than `k` itself.

3. **Objective**: After performing the swap operations, we need to determine the position `j` such that `a_j = 1`.

### Key Observations

- **Divisors and Swaps**: The largest divisor of `k` other than `k` itself is `k // 2` if `k` is even, and the largest proper divisor for odd `k` can be found by checking divisors from `k // 2` downwards.
  
- **Position of 1**: The position of 1 in the final array is determined by the series of swaps. It can be shown that the position of 1 after all swaps is `2^p` where `p` is the largest integer such that `2^p ≤ n`.

### Code Analysis

Let's analyze the provided code:

```python
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
```

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Special Case for `n = 1`**: If `n = 1`, the array is `[1]`, and no swaps are performed. The position of 1 is `1`, which is correctly handled.

3. **General Case for `n > 1`**:
   - The code calculates `log2(n)`, which gives the logarithm of `n` to the base 2.
   - It then iteratively increments `power` until `power` is no longer less than `log2(n)`.
   - If `power` equals `log2(n)`, it prints `2 ** power`.
   - Otherwise, it decrements `power` by 1 and prints `2 ** power`.

#### Correctness of the Logic

- The logic to determine the position of 1 as `2^p` where `p` is the largest integer such that `2^p ≤ n` is correct. This is because the position of 1 after all swaps is indeed the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.

- The code correctly implements this logic by using `log2(n)` and adjusting `power` accordingly.

### Conclusion

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the position of 1 after performing the specified swap operations on the array. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
