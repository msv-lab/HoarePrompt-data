Let's break down the problem and the given program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to construct an array \( a \) such that:
- \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \le i \le n \).
- \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

Given the constraints, the values of \( x_i \) are limited to \( 1 \le x_i \le 500 \).

### Program Analysis
The provided program constructs the array \( a \) as follows:
1. Initialize \( a_1 \) to 1000.
2. For each subsequent element \( a_i \) (for \( i \ge 2 \)), set \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \).

Let's check if this construction satisfies the condition \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \).

For \( i \ge 2 \):
\[ a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \]
\[ a_i \mod a_{i-1} = (a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}) \mod a_{i-1} = x_{i-1} \]

This shows that the construction \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \) indeed satisfies the condition \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \).

### Additional Checks
- **Range of \( a_i \)**: The value of \( a_i \) is constructed by adding \( x_{i-1} \) to \( a_{i-1} \). Since \( a_1 = 1000 \) and \( x_i \le 500 \), the maximum value of \( a_i \) will be \( 1000 + 500 \times (n-1) \). Given the constraints \( n \le 500 \), the maximum value of \( a_i \) will be \( 1000 + 500 \times 499 = 1000 + 249500 = 250500 \), which is well within the limit of \( 10^9 \).

### Conclusion
The given program correctly constructs the array \( a \) such that it satisfies the conditions specified in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
