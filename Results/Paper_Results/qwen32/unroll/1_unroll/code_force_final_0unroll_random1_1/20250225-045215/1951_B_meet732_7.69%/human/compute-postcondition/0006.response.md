To determine what will be printed by the `print(ind)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the context of the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `a` is a list of integers where:
  - The first element `t` represents the number of test cases.
  - Each test case is represented by two parts:
    - A list `[n, k]` where `n` is the number of cows and `k` is your cow's 1-based index.
    - A list of `n` integers `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]` representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all `a_i`'s being pairwise different.
- `x` is assigned the value `a[k]` for each test case.
- `ind` is a list containing the indices of up to two cows whose ratings are higher than `x`.
- `c` is the count of such cows, which can be 0, 1, or 2.
- The current value of `k` is 14.

### Analysis:
1. **List `a` Structure**:
   - The first element `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the list `a` contains:
     - `[n, k]` where `n` is the number of cows and `k` is the 1-based index of your cow.
     - `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]` which are the ratings of the cows.

2. **Variable `x`**:
   - `x` is assigned the rating of the cow at the 1-based index `k` for each test case.
   - Since `k` is 14, `x` will be the rating of the cow at index 14 (0-based index 13) in the ratings list of the current test case.

3. **List `ind`**:
   - `ind` is a list that contains the 0-based indices of up to two cows whose ratings are higher than `x`.
   - The count of such cows is `c`, which can be 0, 1, or 2.

### Determining the Output:
- The exact values of `n`, `k`, and the ratings list `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]` are not provided for the current test case.
- Therefore, we cannot determine the exact indices that will be stored in `ind`.
- However, we know that `ind` will contain the indices of up to two cows whose ratings are higher than `x`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ind)` statement will output the list `ind` which contains the indices of up to two cows whose ratings are higher than `x` for the current test case. Since the exact values of the ratings and indices are not provided, we can only describe the content of `ind` in general terms.

Output: **ind (where ind is a list containing the 0-based indices of up to two cows whose ratings are higher than x for the current test case)**
