a is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains n+2 integers. The first integer in each sublist is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the number of test cases. For each test case, the first two integers are n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n), representing the number of cows and your cow's index, respectively. The next n integers in the sublist are the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and these ratings are pairwise different. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
