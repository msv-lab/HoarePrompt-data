Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` of the list represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two parts: the first part is a list of two integers `[n, k]`, where `n` is the number of cows and `k` is your cow's 1-based index, and the second part is a list of `n` integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The function returns different values based on the following cases:
- Case_1: If a certain condition is met, it returns `n - 1`.
- Case_2: If a different condition is met, it returns `k - 1`.
- Case_3: If the cow at index `0` has a higher rating than the cow at index `k-1` and is not at index `0`, it returns the 0-based index of that cow minus 1.
- Case_4: If the cow at index `0` has a higher rating than the cow at index `k-1`, it returns `k - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` is the 0-based index of the cow with the higher rating.
- Case_5: It returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
- Case_6: It returns the maximum of `(ind[0] - 1)` and `(ind[1] - ind[0])`.
- Case_7: It returns `k - ind[0]`.
Only one of these cases is executed based on the conditions provided.**
