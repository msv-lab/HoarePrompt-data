To determine the Output State, we need to understand the impact of the line `b = func_1(d)` on the variables. Since the details of `func_1` are not provided, we can only infer that `b` will be assigned the result of `func_1(d)`. The variables `d`, `a`, and `previous` remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them, which is not indicated in the problem statement.

Given the initial state and the operation performed, the Output State should reflect that `b` now holds the value returned by `func_1(d)`, while the other variables retain their original states.

Output State: **The graph represented by the list of lists remains unchanged; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as calculated by `bfs(a)`; `a` is a list of distances where each distance is twice the corresponding distance in the original `d`; `previous` is a list of previous vertices for path reconstruction; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.**
