The code snippet `u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]` creates a new list `u2vs` where each element is an empty list, and the number of these empty lists is determined by the value of `n`. This means that `u2vs` is now a list of `n` empty lists.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `n` is an input integer.**
