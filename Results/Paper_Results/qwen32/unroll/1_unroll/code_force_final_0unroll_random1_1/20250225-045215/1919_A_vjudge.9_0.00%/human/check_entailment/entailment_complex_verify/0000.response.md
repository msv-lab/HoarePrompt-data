### Reasoning

The problem description states that the game's winner can be determined by the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins \(a + b\). Specifically:
- If \(a + b\) is even, Bob wins.
- If \(a + b\) is odd, Alice wins.

The provided program correctly implements this logic in `func_1(a, b)` by checking the parity of \(a + b\) and returning 'Bob' if the sum is even and 'Alice' if the sum is odd. This matches the key insight derived from the problem statement.

The annotated version of the code confirms that `func_1` is correctly implemented and that `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading input, processing each test case with `func_1`, and printing the results.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
