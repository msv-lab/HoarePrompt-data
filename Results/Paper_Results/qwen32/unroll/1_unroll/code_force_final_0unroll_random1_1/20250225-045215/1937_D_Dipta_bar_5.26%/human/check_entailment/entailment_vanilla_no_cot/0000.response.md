Correctness: **False**

The provided program seems to have a complex logic that attempts to solve the problem efficiently by using lists `A` and `B` to store intermediate results and `idx_A` and `idx_B` to store indices of '>' and '<' respectively. However, the logic appears to be incorrect and overly complicated for the given problem. The calculations and conditions within the loops are not clearly explained and seem to have logical flaws.

To correctly solve the problem, a simpler approach would be to simulate the movement of the pinball for each starting position and keep track of the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid. Here is a more straightforward implementation that should be correct:

```python
def simulate_pinball(n, s):
    results = []
    for start in range(n):
        pos = start
        time = 0
        s_list = list(s)
        while 0 <= pos < n:
            if s_list[pos] == '<':
                next_pos = pos - 1
            else:
                next_pos = pos + 1
            s_list[pos] = '>' if s_list[pos] == '<' else '<'
            pos = next_pos
            time += 1
        results.append(time)
    return results

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    results = simulate_pinball(n, s)
    print(" ".join(map(str, results)))
```

This program simulates the movement of the pinball for each starting position and correctly calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid. This approach is easier to understand and should work within the given constraints.
