You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a string `s` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, representing movements in opposite directions on a one-dimensional grid. It calculates and prints the final positions on the grid after processing each movement direction in the string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by maintaining two lists, `A` and `B`, which are used to track the cumulative movements of the pinball when starting from cells with '>' and '<' respectively. The program also maintains indices `idx_A` and `idx_B` to keep track of the positions of the cells with '>' and '<'. The core idea is to use these lists to compute the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

Let's break down the key steps of the program:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the length of the grid `n` and the grid string `s` are read.
   - The function `func_1(s)` is called to process the grid string `s`.

2. **Processing '>' Characters**:
   - For each cell `i` in the grid, if the character is '>', it calculates the cumulative movement time and stores it in the list `A`.
   - The index `i` is also stored in the list `idx_A`.

3. **Processing '<' Characters**:
   - For each cell `i` in the grid, starting from the end, if the character is '<', it calculates the cumulative movement time and stores it in the list `B`.
   - The index `i` is also stored in the list `idx_B`.

4. **Calculating Output for Each Cell**:
   - Two pointers `l` and `r` are used to keep track of the current positions in the lists `A` and `B`.
   - For each cell `i` in the grid:
     - If the character is '>', it calculates the total time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid by combining the values from `A` and `B`.
     - If the character is '<', it calculates the total time similarly.
   - The calculated time is printed for each cell.

However, the provided code has several issues:

- The logic for calculating the cumulative movement times in `A` and `B` is incorrect. The formula used to calculate `x` in the lists `A` and `B` is not correct and does not reflect the actual movement of the pinball.
- The logic for combining the values from `A` and `B` to calculate the total time is also incorrect. The formula used to calculate the total time does not correctly account for the number of movements and inversions.
- The code does not handle the case where the pinball leaves the grid immediately, which is possible if the first character in the grid is '>' or the last character is '<'.

Given these issues, the program will not produce the correct output for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
