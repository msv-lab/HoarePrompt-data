### Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen, given the periodicity of each sign. The core logic of the program involves iterating over each sign's periodicity and calculating the next occurrence year based on the previous sign's occurrence year.

Let's break down the logic of the program:
1. **Initialization**: The variable `year` is initialized to 0. This represents the starting year before the first sign occurs.
2. **Iteration over Signs**: For each sign's periodicity `ai`, the program calculates the next occurrence year using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`. This expression ensures that:
   - If `year` is already a multiple of `ai` (i.e., `year % ai == 0`), then the next occurrence will be exactly `year + ai`.
   - If `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, then the next occurrence will be the next multiple of `ai` after `year`, which is `year + (ai - year % ai)`. The expression `year % ai or ai` effectively computes this value in a concise manner.
3. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final value of `year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

The provided example in the problem statement aligns with the logic of the program. For instance, in the first example test case:
- The first sign occurs in year 3.
- The second sign occurs in year 4 (the next multiple of 2 after year 3).
- The third sign occurs in year 8 (the next multiple of 4 after year 4).
- The fourth sign occurs in year 10 (the next multiple of 5 after year 8).
- The fifth sign occurs in year 18 (the next multiple of 9 after year 10).
- The sixth sign occurs in year 36 (the next multiple of 18 after year 18).

Thus, the program correctly computes the year for each test case based on the provided logic.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen.
