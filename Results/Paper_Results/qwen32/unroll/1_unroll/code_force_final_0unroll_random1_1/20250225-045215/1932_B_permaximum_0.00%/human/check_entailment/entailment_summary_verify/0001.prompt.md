You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates a value `year` for each test case based on the list of integers and prints this value. The final state of the program is that it has printed `t` values, one for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign i occurs every `a_i` years, and the next sign can only occur after the previous one.

### Program Analysis:
The given program follows these steps:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Year:**
   - It initializes the `year` to 0.
   - For each sign `ai` in the list:
     - It increments `year` by the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current `year`.
     - This is done using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`. 
       - `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`. 
       - If `year % ai` is not zero, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, so the next occurrence of the sign will be `year + (ai - year % ai)`, which can be simplified to `year + (ai - (year % ai))` or `year + ai - year % ai`. 
       - If `year % ai` is zero, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so the next occurrence is just `year + ai`.
       - The expression `year % ai or ai` effectively does this calculation succinctly:
         - If `year % ai` is non-zero, it uses `ai - year % ai` (since `year % ai` is the remainder, `ai - (year % ai)` gives the increment needed to reach the next multiple of `ai`).
         - If `year % ai` is zero, it uses `ai` directly, meaning `year` is already a multiple of `ai`.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the final `year`, which is the year when the n-th sign occurs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the periodicities provided. It handles the sequential occurrence of signs correctly by always waiting for the next sign to occur after the previous one.

Therefore, the program is correct.
