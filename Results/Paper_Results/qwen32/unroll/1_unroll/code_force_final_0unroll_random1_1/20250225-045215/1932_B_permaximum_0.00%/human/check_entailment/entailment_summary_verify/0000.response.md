### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program logic based on the problem description and the provided function summary. The key part of the logic that needs to be verified is the expression `year += year % ai or ai`. This expression is intended to find the next occurrence of the i-th sign after the current `year`.

1. **Understanding the Expression**:
   - `year % ai` computes the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`.
   - `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `ai` if `year % ai` is 0 (meaning `year` is already a multiple of `ai`), otherwise it evaluates to `year % ai`.
   - The expression effectively adds the smallest multiple of `ai` that is strictly greater than `year` to `year`.

2. **Correctness Check**:
   - For the first test case (`6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`):
     - `year = 0`
     - `year += 0 % 3 or 3` → `year = 3` (correct)
     - `year += 3 % 2 or 2` → `year = 5` (correct)
     - `year += 5 % 4 or 4` → `year = 8` (correct)
     - `year += 8 % 5 or 5` → `year = 10` (correct)
     - `year += 10 % 9 or 9` → `year = 18` (correct)
     - `year += 18 % 18 or 18` → `year = 36` (correct)
   - For the second test case (`5`, `1 2 3 4 5`):
     - `year = 0`
     - `year += 0 % 1 or 1` → `year = 1` (correct)
     - `year += 1 % 2 or 2` → `year = 3` (incorrect, should be `2`)
     - `year += 2 % 3 or 3` → `year = 5` (incorrect, should be `3`)
     - `year += 3 % 4 or 4` → `year = 7` (incorrect, should be `4`)
     - `year += 4 % 5 or 5` → `year = 9` (incorrect, should be `5`)

The issue arises from the incorrect interpretation of the `year += year % ai or ai` expression. Specifically, `year % ai or ai` does not correctly handle cases where `year` is not a multiple of `ai` and should be incremented to the next multiple of `ai`.

3. **Correct Expression**:
   - The correct expression should be `year += ai - year % ai if year % ai != 0 else ai`. This ensures that `year` is incremented to the next multiple of `ai`.

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += ai - year % ai if year % ai != 0 else ai
        print(year)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the misuse of the expression `year += year % ai or ai`. The correct expression should ensure that `year` is incremented to the next multiple of `ai` correctly.

Final: **False**.
