`The value of t is assigned the value of the integer input. The constraints on t (1 <= t <= 1000) remain valid. The values of n and the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are still unknown and remain as per the initial state.`
Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.**
