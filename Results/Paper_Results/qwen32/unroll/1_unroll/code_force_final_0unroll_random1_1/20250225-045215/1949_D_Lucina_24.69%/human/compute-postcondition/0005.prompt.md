Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 24; The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', where 'F' denotes a funny transition video, 'S' denotes a scary transition video, '?' denotes an undecided transition video, and '.' denotes the same scenario (i.e., i=j). The input is symmetric, meaning the j-th character of the i-th line is the same as the i-th character of the j-th line. There are at most floor(n/2) characters in the input that are either 'F' or 'S'; `a` is a list of 0s with length n + 1; `b` is a list of 0s with length n + 1; `xx` is a list containing a single empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    x = input()
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if x[j - 1] == 'F':
            a[i] += 1
            a[j] += 1
        elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
            b[i] += 1
            b[j] += 1
    xx.append(x)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
