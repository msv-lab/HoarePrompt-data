Postcondition: **`sa` is a list of nodes that have 'F' characters but no 'S' characters; `sb` is a list of nodes that have 'S' characters but no 'F' characters; `a` and `b` lists remain as they were initially with counts of 'F' and 'S' respectively; `xx` remains unchanged. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, the loop prints a new string `nx` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, where '?' characters in `xx` are replaced according to the rules involving `sa`. Otherwise, the variable `xx` remains unchanged, and the lists `sa`, `sb`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the loop prints a new string `nx` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, where each character in `nx` is determined by the conditions specified in the loop.**
