Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 24; The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', where 'F' denotes a funny transition video, 'S' denotes a scary transition video, '?' denotes an undecided transition video, and '.' denotes the same scenario (i.e., i=j). The input is symmetric, meaning the j-th character of the i-th line is the same as the i-th character of the j-th line. There are at most floor(n/2) characters in the input that are either 'F' or 'S'; `a` is a list of 0s with length n + 1; `b` is a list of 0s with length n + 1`.**

In simple terms, the variable `b` has been added and is initialized as a list of 0s with the same length as `a`, which is `n + 1`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
