Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not ensure that no matter which order the player approaches the scenarios, they will never see more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type in a row. The logic for assigning 'F' and 'S' to '?' characters is flawed and does not consider the requirement for all permutations of scenarios. 

Hereâ€™s a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
5
.?F??
?.???
F?.S?
??S.?
????.
```
The program might output something like:
```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
FFS.F
FFFF.
```
However, let's consider the permutation of scenarios: 1, 3, 4, 2, 5. The corresponding sequence of transition videos is:
```
FSSF
```
This sequence contains 3 'F's in a row, which is more than \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\). Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement for all permutations of scenarios.

The code does not properly handle the requirement to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type occur for any permutation of scenarios. It simply assigns 'F' or 'S' based on a fixed rule without considering the overall constraint across all permutations.
