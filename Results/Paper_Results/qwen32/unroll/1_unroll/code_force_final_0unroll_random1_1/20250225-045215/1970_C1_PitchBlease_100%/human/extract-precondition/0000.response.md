Precondition: **start is an integer representing the starting node in the tree, and target is an integer representing the target node in the tree. Both start and target are within the range of 1 to n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The tree is represented as an adjacency list stored in the variable tree, which is a dictionary where keys are node integers and values are lists of neighboring node integers.**
