Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node in the tree, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list stored in the variable tree, which is a dictionary where keys are node integers and values are lists of neighboring node integers, `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`.**

In simple terms, the `queue` has been initialized with a single element, a tuple containing the `start` node and the integer `0`. All other variables (`start`, `target`, and `tree`) remain unchanged.
