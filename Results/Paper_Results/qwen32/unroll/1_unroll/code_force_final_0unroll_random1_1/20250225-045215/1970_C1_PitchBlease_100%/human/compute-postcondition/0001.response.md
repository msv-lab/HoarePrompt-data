Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node in the tree, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list stored in the variable tree, which is a dictionary where keys are node integers and values are lists of neighboring node integers, `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`, `visited` is a set containing the `start` node.**

In this output state, the `visited` set has been updated to include the `start` node, while all other variables retain their initial values.
