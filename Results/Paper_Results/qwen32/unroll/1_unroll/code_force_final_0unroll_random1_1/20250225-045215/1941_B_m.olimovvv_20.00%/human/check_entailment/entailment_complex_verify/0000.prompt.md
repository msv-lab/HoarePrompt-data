You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO

    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_j satisfies 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it checks if the first or last element of the list is odd and, if so, whether it is followed or preceded by an element that is exactly two more than itself. If either condition fails, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. The program checks only the first and last elements of the array for specific conditions, which is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be reduced to zero.

Here is a counterexample to show that the program is incorrect:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Explanation of the Counterexample:
Starting with the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, we can perform the following operations:
1. Apply the operation at index 3: `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`
2. Apply the operation at index 3: `[0, -1, 0, -1, 0]`
3. Apply the operation at index 2: `[-1, -2, -1, -1, 0]`
4. Apply the operation at index 2: `[-2, -3, -2, 0, 0]`
5. Apply the operation at index 2: `[-3, -4, -3, 1, 0]`
6. Apply the operation at index 4: `[-3, -4, -4, -1, 0]`
7. Apply the operation at index 4: `[-3, -4, -5, -2, 0]`
8. Apply the operation at index 4: `[-3, -4, -6, -3, 0]`
9. Apply the operation at index 4: `[-3, -4, -7, -4, 0]`
10. Continue applying the operation at index 4 until all elements are zero.

However, the provided program would incorrectly output "NO" for this input because it only checks the first and last elements for specific conditions that do not apply to this scenario.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
