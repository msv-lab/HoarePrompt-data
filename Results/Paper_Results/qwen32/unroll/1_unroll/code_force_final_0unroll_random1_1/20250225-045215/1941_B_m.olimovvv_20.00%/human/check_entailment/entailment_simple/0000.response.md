Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. The logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the conditions `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2` and `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2` are not sufficient to determine the possibility of making all elements of the array zero.

The given problem requires a more comprehensive approach to check the feasibility of reducing all elements to zero. One key insight is that the operation can only reduce the values in a specific pattern, and it is not enough to just check the first and last elements. The correct solution would involve checking the parity (odd/even nature) of the elements and ensuring that the operations can be applied in such a way that all elements can be reduced to zero.

For example, the sum of all elements must be even because each operation reduces the sum by 4. Additionally, the sequence of operations must be able to reduce each element to zero without violating the constraints of the operation.

Since the provided program does not implement a correct algorithm to solve the problem, it will produce incorrect results for many test cases.

Correctness: **False**
