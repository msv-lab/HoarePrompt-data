Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining if Rudolf can make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation. The operation modifies three consecutive elements in the array by subtracting 1, 2, and 1 respectively from the first, second, and third elements in the triplet.

### Key Points:
1. **Operation Constraints**:
   - The operation can only be performed on indices `i` where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`.
   - Each operation modifies `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]`.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero by applying the operation any number of times.

3. **Observations**:
   - The operation affects three consecutive elements.
   - The operation can only reduce the values in the array; it cannot increase them.
   - The parity (odd/even nature) of the elements can be a key factor. For example, if an element is odd, it must be possible to reduce it to zero, which means it must be part of a sequence that allows it to be reduced by the operation.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks the conditions on the first and last elements of the array to determine if it's possible to make all elements zero. Specifically, it checks:
- If the first element (`b[0]`) is odd and the second element (`b[1]`) is not equal to the first element plus 2, it prints "NO".
- If the last element (`b[-1]`) is odd and the second last element (`b[-2]`) is not equal to the last element plus 2, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Issues with the Program:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if all elements can be reduced to zero. It only checks the first and last elements, which is not sufficient to determine the possibility of reducing the entire array to zero. The program does not consider the intermediate elements and their interactions, which are crucial for solving the problem.

### Correctness:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as it only checks the first and last elements without considering the entire array and the interactions between elements. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
