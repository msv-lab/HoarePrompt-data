The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it checks if the first or last element of the list is odd and, if so, whether it is followed or preceded by an element that is exactly two more than itself. If either condition fails, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'.
