In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not intend to use. Therefore, the only variable we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The other variables (`n`, `q`, `c`, `l_i`, and `r_i`) are defined within the loop body and do not affect the execution of the loop itself.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
