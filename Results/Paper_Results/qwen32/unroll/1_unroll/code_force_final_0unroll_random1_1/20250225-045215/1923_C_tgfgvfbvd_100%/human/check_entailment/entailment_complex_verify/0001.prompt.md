You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. No other variables retain their values as they are local to each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of elements and `q` representing the number of queries. It then reads a list `l` of `n` integers. For each query, which consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`, the function determines if the sum of the elements from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive) minus the number of elements in this range is greater than or equal to the count of 1's in the same range. It prints 'YES' if the condition is met, otherwise 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if a subarray is "good" based on certain conditions.
- A subarray is "good" if there exists an array `b` such that:
  1. The sum of elements in the subarray is equal to the sum of elements in `b`.
  2. Each element in the subarray is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
  3. Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

### Key Observations:
- For a subarray to be "good", the sum of the subarray must be greater than the number of elements in the subarray (since each element in `b` must be greater than 0 and different from the corresponding element in the subarray).
- If the subarray has only one element, it cannot be "good" because there is no way to create a `b` array that meets all the conditions with a single element.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It reads the array `l` of length `n`.
   - It reads `q` queries, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Prefix Sum Arrays**:
   - The program creates two prefix sum arrays:
     - `p`: Prefix sum of the array `l`.
     - `c`: Prefix sum of the number of 1s in the array `l`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray using the prefix sum array `p`.
   - It also calculates the number of 1s in the subarray using the prefix sum array `c`.
   - It checks if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is greater than or equal to the number of 1s in the subarray.
   - If the subarray has more than one element and the above condition is satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Analysis:
- The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has more than one element.
- The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` checks if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is greater than or equal to the number of 1s in the subarray. This condition ensures that we can create a `b` array where each element is greater than 0 and different from the corresponding element in the subarray.
- The logic seems correct based on the problem requirements.

However, there is a logical flaw in the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`. The condition should simply be `s > b - a` to ensure that the sum of the subarray is greater than the number of elements in the subarray, which is necessary for the subarray to be "good".

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the necessary condition for a subarray to be "good". The correct condition should be `s > b - a` instead of `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`.
