Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m` using only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` disjoint sequences of all `k` unique characters. If it does, it prints "YES". If not, it prints "NO" and constructs a string by appending a missing character and additional 'a' characters to meet the requirement, then prints the constructed string.**
