### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. The optimal strategy to achieve the maximum score is to always pick the smallest available numbers first, because the smaller number in each pair will be added to the score, and picking the smallest numbers ensures that we maximize the contribution of each pair to the score.

The provided program correctly implements this strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of `2n` integers.
   - It sorts the list `a` in ascending order.
   - It iterates over the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element, which is the smallest) and adds it to the score.
   - It prints the final score for that test case.

By sorting the list and summing every second element starting from the smallest, the program effectively picks the smallest numbers in each pair, thus maximizing the score as required by the problem statement.
