In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `_` and the range is determined by `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t` since `t` is the number of test cases and is expected to be inputted. The state before the loop starts should ensure that the loop can execute at least once.

Let's analyze the loop head:
- `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted.
- The loop will iterate `int(input())` times, which should be equal to `t`.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, we need to ensure that the input function returns `t` for the loop to execute correctly. Since `t` is already provided and within the valid range, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself, but we need to ensure that `int(input())` returns `t`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that the input function will return `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and `int(input())` returns `t`**
