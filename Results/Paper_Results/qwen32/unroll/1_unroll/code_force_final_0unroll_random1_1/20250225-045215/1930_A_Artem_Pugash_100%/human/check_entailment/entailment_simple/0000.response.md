### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the score by choosing pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. The optimal strategy to achieve this is to pair the smallest numbers together. This is because the minimum of a pair will always be smaller or equal to any other possible pairings of the same numbers with larger numbers.

The given program follows this optimal strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
4. It then iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adding it to the score. These elements are the smallest in each pair when the list is sorted.

Since the program sorts the list and always picks the smallest available number to add to the score (by picking every second element in the sorted list), it ensures that the score is maximized.
