### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2`:** 
   - This function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. 
   - It checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` because no permutation can have an odd Manhattan value.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` for a permutation of length `n`. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is `(n ** 2 - 1) // 2`, and if `n` is even, `max_k` is `n ** 2 // 2`.
   - If `k` is greater than `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)` because the requested Manhattan value is too large to be achieved with a permutation of length `n`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function generates a permutation of length `n` with a specific Manhattan value `k`.
   - It divides `k` by 2, which simplifies the problem because the Manhattan value is always even.
   - It initializes a list `l` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, adjusting the list to achieve the required Manhattan value `k` by moving elements.
   - The loop logic ensures that the Manhattan value is reduced by the appropriate amount with each iteration until `k` is 0.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function prints the permutation `l` if a valid permutation is found.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the permutation elements separated by spaces.
   - If no valid permutation is found, `func_4` will print "NO".

4. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_2` to validate `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0 (indicating an invalid `k`), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate a permutation and then `func_3` to print it.

### Verification:
- **Correctness of `func_2`:** The function correctly checks for the feasibility of the Manhattan value `k` and calculates the maximum possible value `max_k` based on `n`.
- **Correctness of `func_1`:** The function attempts to construct a permutation with the given Manhattan value `k` by rearranging the elements of the list `l`. The logic is complex but appears to be designed to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
- **Correctness of `func_3`:** This function correctly prints the permutation if it exists.
- **Correctness of `func_4`:** This function correctly orchestrates the process and handles the invalid cases.

### Conclusion:
Given the provided functions and their roles, the program appears to correctly determine whether a permutation with the given Manhattan value exists and prints it if possible. Therefore, based on the provided logic and the problem description, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
