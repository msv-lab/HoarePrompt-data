The initial state describes the variables `n` and `k` with specific constraints, but the print statement in the code snippet is a simple string output that does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. The print statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will output the string 'NO' regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **NO**
