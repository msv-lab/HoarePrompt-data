Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12. The current value of `n` is 0.** 

(Note: The if condition `if (n == 0):` contradicts the precondition that `n` is a positive integer. Since the precondition and if condition cannot both be true simultaneously, the postcondition reflects the if condition as the current state, indicating `n` is 0, while acknowledging the initial conditions for `n` and `k`.)
