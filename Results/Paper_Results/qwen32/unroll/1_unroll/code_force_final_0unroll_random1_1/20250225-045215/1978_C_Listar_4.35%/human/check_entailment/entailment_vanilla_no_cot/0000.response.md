Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Manhattan Value Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to manipulate the Manhattan value by dividing `k` by 2, which is not a valid strategy for constructing a permutation with a specific Manhattan value.
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly ensure that the resulting permutation has the desired Manhattan value.

2. **Incorrect Maximum Manhattan Value Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `max_k` in `func_2` is incorrect. The maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is `n*(n-1)`, not `(n^2 - 1) // 2` or `n^2 // 2`.

3. **Handling of Odd `n` and Even `n`**:
   - The distinction between odd and even `n` in `func_2` for calculating `max_k` is incorrect and unnecessary.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The output format in `func_3` is incorrect. It should print all elements of the list on the same line separated by spaces, not each element on a new line.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when `k` is 0 or when `k` is the maximum possible Manhattan value.

To correct the program, a different approach is needed to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_permutation(n, k):
    if k == 0:
        return list(range(1, n + 1))
    
    max_manhattan = n * (n - 1)
    if k > max_manhattan:
        return None
    
    # Start with the identity permutation
    perm = list(range(1, n + 1))
    i = n - 1
    while k > 0:
        # Calculate the maximum possible contribution from the current position
        max_contribution = i
        if k >= max_contribution:
            # Swap the current element with the last element
            perm[i], perm[n - 1] = perm[n - 1], perm[i]
            k -= max_contribution
            i -= 1
        else:
            # Find the correct position to swap with
            swap_pos = n - 1 - k
            perm[i], perm[swap_pos] = perm[swap_pos], perm[i]
            k = 0
    
    return perm

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        k = int(input[index + 1])
        index += 2
        perm = find_permutation(n, k)
        if perm is None:
            results.append("NO")
        else:
            results.append("YES")
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, perm)))
    print("\n".join(results))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version constructs a permutation with the desired Manhattan value by iteratively making the largest possible swaps until the desired Manhattan value is achieved. It also correctly handles the edge cases and outputs the results in the required format.
