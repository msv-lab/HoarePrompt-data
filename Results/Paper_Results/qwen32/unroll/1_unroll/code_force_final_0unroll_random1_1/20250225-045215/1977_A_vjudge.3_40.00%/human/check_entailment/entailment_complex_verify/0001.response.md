Let's systematically analyze the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem specifies that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. The goal is to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, starting with no cubes.

### Key Observations:
- The number of cubes after `n` moves can range from `0` (if all moves are removals) to `n` (if all moves are additions).
- The difference between the number of additions and removals must equal `m`.
- If `m > n`, it's impossible because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n`.
- If `m < 0`, it's impossible because the minimum number of cubes is `0`.
- If `m == n`, it's possible if all moves are additions.
- If `m < n`, it's possible if the difference between the number of additions and removals equals `m`.

### Detailed Analysis of the Program:
Let's go through the logic in the provided program:

1. **If `n == m`:**
   - The program outputs "Yes", which is correct because if `n` moves are all additions, we end up with `m` cubes.
   
2. **If `m > n`:**
   - The program outputs "No", which is correct because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   
3. **If `m == n - 1`:**
   - The program outputs "Yes", which is correct because we can add `n-1` cubes and remove `1` cube.
   
4. **If `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`:**
   - The program outputs "Yes", which is correct because if both `m` and `n` are even, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes by having an equal number of additions and removals that result in an even number of cubes.
   
5. **If `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`:**
   - The program outputs "Yes", which is correct because if both `m` and `n` are odd, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes by having an equal number of additions and removals that result in an odd number of cubes.
   
6. **Else:**
   - The program outputs "No", which is correct because if the parity (odd/even nature) of `m` and `n` do not match, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes with `n` moves.

### Evaluating the Annotations:
The annotations provide a good summary of the program's logic and the state of the program at key points. However, let's consider some edge cases and the logic for each condition to ensure correctness.

### Edge Cases:
- **`m == 0`:**
  - If `m == 0`, it is possible if `n` is even (by adding and removing cubes in pairs) or if `n == 0` (which is not possible as per the problem constraints).
- **`m == 1`:**
  - If `m == 1`, it is possible if `n` is odd (by adding one more cube than removing).

### Revisiting the Conditions:
- **If `m == n - 1`:**
  - This condition is correct because we can add `n-1` cubes and remove 1 cube.
- **If `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`:**
  - This condition is correct because we can achieve `m` cubes by having an equal number of additions and removals.
- **If `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`:**
  - This condition is correct because we can achieve `m` cubes by having an equal number of additions and removals.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is mostly correct, but let's consider the following:
- The condition `elif m == n - 1:` is redundant because it is covered by the parity conditions. If `m == n - 1`, both `m` and `n` will have the same parity (both even or both odd), so the parity conditions will already handle this case.

### Revised Program:
The program can be simplified by removing the redundant condition:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The program is correct, and the original assessment is accurate. The redundant condition does not affect the correctness of the program, but it can be simplified.

Final: **True**
