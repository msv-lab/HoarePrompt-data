You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: A series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses, one for each pair of `n` and `m`, determined by the conditions specified in the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem statement and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
Nikita can perform two types of moves:
1. Add one cube to the tower.
2. Remove one cube from the tower.

We need to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Observations:
- After `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can range from `0` (if all moves are removals) to `n` (if all moves are additions).
- The difference between the number of additions and removals must equal `m`.
- If `m` is greater than `n`, it is impossible because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n`.
- If `m` is less than `0`, it is impossible because the minimum number of cubes that can be in the tower is `0`.
- If `m` is equal to `n`, it is possible if all moves are additions.
- If `m` is less than `n`, it is possible if the difference between the number of additions and removals equals `m`.

### Detailed Analysis of the Program:
Let's go through the logic in the provided program:

1. **If `n == m`:**
   - The program outputs "Yes", which is correct because if `n` moves are all additions, we end up with `m` cubes.
   
2. **If `m > n`:**
   - The program outputs "No", which is correct because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   
3. **If `m == n - 1`:**
   - The program outputs "Yes", which is correct because we can add `n-1` cubes and remove `1` cube.
   
4. **If `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`:**
   - The program outputs "Yes", which is correct because if both `m` and `n` are even, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes by having an equal number of additions and removals that result in an even number of cubes.
   
5. **If `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`:**
   - The program outputs "Yes", which is correct because if both `m` and `n` are odd, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes by having an equal number of additions and removals that result in an odd number of cubes.
   
6. **Else:**
   - The program outputs "No", which is correct because if the parity (odd/even nature) of `m` and `n` do not match, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes with `n` moves.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles all cases as per the problem statement and the observations.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
