The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer within a certain range, and `row1` and `row2` are strings of length `n` consisting of specific characters. The execution of the code only affects the variable `t` by assigning it the value of the integer input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `row1` and `row2` are strings of length n consisting of the characters '<' and/or '>', `t` is an input integer.**
