The provided code snippet is a comment and does not perform any operations that would change the values of `n`, `row1`, or `row2`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `row1` and `row2` are strings of length n consisting of the characters '<' and/or '>'**.
