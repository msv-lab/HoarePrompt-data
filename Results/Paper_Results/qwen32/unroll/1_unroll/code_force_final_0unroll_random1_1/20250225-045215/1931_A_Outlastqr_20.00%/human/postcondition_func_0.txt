The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where 3 <= n <= 78) and prints a specific string based on the value of `n`. The string is constructed using the lowercase English alphabet and follows a particular pattern depending on whether `n` is less than or equal to 26, between 27 and 52, or greater than 52. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without modifying the input values `t` and `n` from the last test case.
