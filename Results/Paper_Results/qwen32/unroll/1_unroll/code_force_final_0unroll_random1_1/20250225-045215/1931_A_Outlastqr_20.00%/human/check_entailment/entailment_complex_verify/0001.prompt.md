You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: `t` is unchanged, `n` is the value from the last iteration, `word` is the string constructed in the last iteration based on that value of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where 3 <= n <= 78) and prints a specific string based on the value of `n`. The string is constructed using the lowercase English alphabet and follows a particular pattern depending on whether `n` is less than or equal to 26, between 27 and 52, or greater than 52. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without modifying the input values `t` and `n` from the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Input:** An integer \( n \) representing the sum of the positions of three letters in the alphabet.
2. **Output:** The lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to \( n \).
3. **Constraints:** \( 3 \leq n \leq 78 \).

### Program Analysis:
The program uses the following logic to determine the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word:

1. **Alphabet Mapping:**
   - The program uses `string.ascii_lowercase` to get the list of lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
   - Each letter in this list corresponds to a position from 1 to 26.

2. **Logic for Constructing the Word:**
   - If \( n > 52 \):
     - The program constructs the word by choosing the letter corresponding to \( n - 53 \) (since 'z' + 'z' = 52) and appending 'zz'.
   - If \( n > 26 \):
     - The program constructs the word by choosing 'a' and the letter corresponding to \( n - 28 \) (since 'a' + 'z' = 27) and appending 'z'.
   - If \( n \leq 26 \):
     - The program constructs the word by using 'aa' and the letter corresponding to \( n - 3 \) (since 'a' + 'a' + 'a' = 3).

### Verification Against Test Cases:
Let's verify the logic with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case \( n = 24 \):**
   - According to the program, since \( 24 \leq 26 \), it constructs the word as 'aa' + alphabet[24 - 3] = 'aa' + 'r' = 'aar'.
   - However, the correct output is 'aav' because 'aav' is lexicographically smaller than 'aar' and sums to 24.

2. **Test Case \( n = 70 \):**
   - According to the program, since \( 70 > 52 \), it constructs the word as alphabet[70 - 53] + 'zz' = alphabet[17] + 'zz' = 'rzz'.
   - This is correct as 'rzz' sums to 70 and is lexicographically smallest.

3. **Test Case \( n = 3 \):**
   - According to the program, since \( 3 \leq 26 \), it constructs the word as 'aa' + alphabet[3 - 3] = 'aa' + 'a' = 'aaa'.
   - This is correct as 'aaa' sums to 3 and is lexicographically smallest.

4. **Test Case \( n = 55 \):**
   - According to the program, since \( 55 > 52 \), it constructs the word as alphabet[55 - 53] + 'zz' = alphabet[2] + 'zz' = 'bzz'.
   - However, the correct output is 'czz' because 'czz' is lexicographically smaller than 'bzz' and sums to 55.

5. **Test Case \( n = 48 \):**
   - According to the program, since \( 48 > 52 \) is false and \( 48 > 26 \) is true, it constructs the word as 'a' + alphabet[48 - 28] + 'z' = 'a' + alphabet[20] + 'z' = 'atzz'.
   - However, the correct output is 'auz' because 'auz' is lexicographically smaller than 'atzz' and sums to 48.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases, especially for \( n \leq 52 \). It fails to find the lexicographically smallest word for these cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
