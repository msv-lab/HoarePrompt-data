To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `i * i <= n + i` is satisfied right before the loop starts.

Given:
- `i` is 1.
- `ans` is 0.
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).

The loop condition is:
```
while i * i <= n + i:
```

Let's substitute `i = 1` into the condition:
```
1 * 1 <= n + 1
```
This simplifies to:
```
1 <= n + 1
```
Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:
```
0 <= n
```

Since `n` is a positive integer, `0 <= n` is always true. Therefore, the condition `1 * i <= n + i` will always be satisfied for any positive integer `n`.

No adjustments are needed for `n` or `i` because the condition is inherently satisfied with the given initial values.

Thus, the state right before the loop can remain as it is.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0**
