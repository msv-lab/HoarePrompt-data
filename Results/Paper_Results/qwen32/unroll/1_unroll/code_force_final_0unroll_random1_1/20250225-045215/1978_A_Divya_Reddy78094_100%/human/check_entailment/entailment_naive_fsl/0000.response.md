Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program always considers the maximum number among all books except the last one and adds it to the last book's pages. This is not the correct approach to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles and reading the highest number in each pile.

Let's consider a test case:

Input:
```
2
3
1 2 3
3
3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
5
5
```

Actual Output of the Program:
```
3
5
```

For the first test case, the program considers the maximum number among `1` and `2` (which is `2`) and adds it to `3`, resulting in `5`. However, the correct way to maximize the pages Alice can read is to divide the books into two piles such that the highest numbers in each pile are added together. For instance, one optimal division is `[1, 3]` and `[2]`, resulting in `3 + 2 = 5`. Another optimal division is `[1, 2]` and `[3]`, resulting in `2 + 3 = 5`.

For the second test case, the program considers the maximum number among `3` and `2` (which is `3`) and adds it to `1`, resulting in `4`. However, the correct way to maximize the pages Alice can read is to divide the books into two piles such that the highest numbers in each pile are added together. For instance, one optimal division is `[3, 1]` and `[2]`, resulting in `3 + 2 = 5`. Another optimal division is `[3, 2]` and `[1]`, resulting in `3 + 2 = 5`.

The program does not handle the problem correctly and fails to find the optimal division of books into two piles to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
