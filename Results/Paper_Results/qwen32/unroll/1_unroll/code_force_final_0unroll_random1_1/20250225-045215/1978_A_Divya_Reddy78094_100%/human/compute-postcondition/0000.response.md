Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and it is assigned the value `int(input())`. The information about the number of books `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for each test case is still to be read.**
In simpler terms, `t` now holds the number of test cases, and we are ready to process each test case which includes the number of books and their respective page counts.
