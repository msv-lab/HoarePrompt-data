Output State: **The value of `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the program reads the number of books `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It then calculates and prints the sum of the maximum value from all but the last integer in the list and the last integer itself. No other variables are changed beyond the loop's iteration counter and the input values read within each iteration.**
