You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, na, nb, and nc are positive integers such that na + nb + nc = n, and numbers is a list of n positive integers.
def func_2(n, na, nb, nc, numbers):
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    group_a, group_b, group_c = [], [], []
    sum_a, sum_b, sum_c = 0, 0, 0
    for num in numbers:
        distribute_number(num)
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order; `group_a` is a list containing `na` numbers from `numbers`, `group_b` is a list containing `nb` numbers from `numbers`, and `group_c` is a list containing `nc` numbers from `numbers`; `sum_a` is the sum of the numbers in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the numbers in `group_b`, and `sum_c` is the sum of the numbers in `group_c`.
    if func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) :
        return 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
        #The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c where group_a contains na numbers, group_b contains nb numbers, and group_c contains nc numbers from the list 'numbers' sorted in descending order, and the condition func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) is true.
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. Here, `n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that their sum equals `n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers. The function returns 'YES' along with three groups `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` if it is possible to partition the numbers into these groups such that each group contains `na`, `nb`, and `nc` numbers respectively, sorted in descending order, and the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` is true. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c where group_a contains na numbers, group_b contains nb numbers, and group_c contains nc numbers from the list 'numbers' sorted in descending order, and the condition func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) is true.

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
