Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order; `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists; `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0.**

This means that the variables `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` have been initialized to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.
