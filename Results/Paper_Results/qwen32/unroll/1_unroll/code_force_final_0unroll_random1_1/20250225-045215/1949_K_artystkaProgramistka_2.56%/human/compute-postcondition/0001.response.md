The provided Python code snippet initializes three empty lists named `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. This action does not change the values of the pre-existing variables `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, or `numbers`. The only change is the creation of three new empty lists.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order; `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists.**
