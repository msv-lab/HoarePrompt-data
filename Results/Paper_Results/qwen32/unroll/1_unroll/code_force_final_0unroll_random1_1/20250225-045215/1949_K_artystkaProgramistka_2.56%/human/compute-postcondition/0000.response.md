The code snippet sorts the list `numbers` in descending order. This affects the order of elements in the `numbers` list, but does not change the values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, or `nc`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.**
