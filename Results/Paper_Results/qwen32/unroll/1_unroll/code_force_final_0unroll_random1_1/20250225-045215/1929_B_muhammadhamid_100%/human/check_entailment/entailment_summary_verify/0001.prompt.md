You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers, `n` and `k`. Here, `n` represents the size of a square grid, and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell. For each test case, the function calculates and outputs the minimum number of colored cells required to meet the condition on `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals (both main and anti-diagonals) contain at least one colored cell.

1. **Understanding Diagonals:**
   - There are \( 2n - 1 \) main diagonals (from top-left to bottom-right).
   - There are \( 2n - 1 \) anti-diagonals (from top-right to bottom-left).
   - Total diagonals = \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Objective:**
   - Minimize the number of cells colored.
   - Ensure at least \( k \) diagonals each have at least one colored cell.

### Key Observations

- **Minimum Coloring:**
  - If \( k \leq 2n - 1 \), we can color one cell per diagonal. For example, coloring the main diagonal will cover \( n \) diagonals, and coloring the anti-diagonal will cover another \( n \) diagonals (with the middle diagonal counted twice).
  - If \( k > 2n - 1 \), we need to color additional cells in already covered diagonals.

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
```

- **Case \( k = 1 \):** The program correctly outputs 1, as only one cell is needed.
- **Case \( k \leq 2 * (n + (n - 2)) \):**
  - The condition \( k \leq 2 * (n + (n - 2)) \) simplifies to \( k \leq 4n - 4 \).
  - The program outputs \( \text{math.ceil}(k / 2) \).
  - This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that we can cover more diagonals with fewer cells if \( k \) is close to \( 2n - 1 \). For example, if \( k = 2n - 1 \), we only need \( n \) cells, not \( \text{math.ceil}(k / 2) \).
- **Case \( k > 2 * (n + (n - 2)) \):**
  - The condition \( k > 4n - 4 \) is not meaningful because the maximum \( k \) is \( 4n - 2 \).
  - The program outputs \( k // 2 + 1 \).
  - This is also incorrect for the same reasons as above.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cells needed to color at least \( k \) diagonals. The logic for determining the minimum cells is flawed.
