Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The initial conditions for the test cases (n, m, and the grid) are still unspecified.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The initial conditions for the test cases, including the dimensions of the grid `n` and `m`, and the grid itself, remain unchanged and unspecified.
