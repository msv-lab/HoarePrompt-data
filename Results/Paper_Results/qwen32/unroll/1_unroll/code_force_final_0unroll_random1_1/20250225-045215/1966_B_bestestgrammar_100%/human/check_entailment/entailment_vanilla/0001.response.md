### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if it is possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using the specified operations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and reasoning behind the program:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid, `n` (rows) and `m` (columns).
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing it as a list of strings where each string represents a row of the grid.

2. **Initial Assumption**:
   - The program assumes the answer is 'YES' initially, meaning it assumes it is possible to make all squares the same color.

3. **Checking Corner Colors**:
   - The program checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) are the same color.
   - If these two corners are different, it sets a flag `impossible` to `True`.

4. **Checking Rows and Columns**:
   - The program then checks if all squares in the first row are the same color and all squares in the last row are the same color.
   - Similarly, it checks if all squares in the first column are the same color and all squares in the last column are the same color.
   - If any of these checks fail (i.e., if there are differing colors within the same row or column), it sets `impossible` to `False`.

5. **Determining the Answer**:
   - If `impossible` remains `True` after checking the above conditions, it means that the grid cannot be made uniform using the given operations, and the answer is set to 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, the answer remains 'YES'.

### Analysis of Logic:

The logic behind the program is sound but somewhat limited. Here's why it works:

- If the top-left and bottom-right corners are different and there are no changes in color within the first and last rows and columns, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform because there would be no way to connect the different regions without changing the colors of the boundary rows or columns.
- However, the program does not fully account for all possible configurations. For example, it does not check the internal structure of the grid beyond the boundaries.

### Testing the Program:

Let's test the program with the provided example to ensure it works correctly:

- **Test Case 1**:
  ```
  2 1
  W
  B
  ```
  - The top-left and bottom-right corners are different.
  - There are no changes within the first and last rows/columns.
  - The program correctly outputs 'NO'.

- **Test Case 2**:
  ```
  6 6
  WWWWBW
  WBWWWW
  BBBWWW
  BWWWBB
  WWBWBB
  BBBWBW
  ```
  - The top-left and bottom-right corners are different.
  - There are changes within the first and last rows/columns.
  - The program correctly outputs 'YES'.

- **Test Case 3**:
  ```
  1 1
  W
  ```
  - The grid is already uniform.
  - The program correctly outputs 'YES'.

- **Test Case 4**:
  ```
  2 2
  BB
  BB
  ```
  - The grid is already uniform.
  - The program correctly outputs 'YES'.

- **Test Case 5**:
  ```
  3 4
  BWBW
  WBWB
  BWBW
  ```
  - The top-left and bottom-right corners are different.
  - There are changes within the first and last rows/columns.
  - The program correctly outputs 'YES'.

- **Test Case 6**:
  ```
  4 2
  BB
  BB
  WW
  WW
  ```
  - The top-left and bottom-right corners are different.
  - There are no changes within the first and last rows/columns.
  - The program correctly outputs 'NO'.

- **Test Case 7**:
  ```
  4 4
  WWBW
  BBWB
  WWBB
  BBBB
  ```
  - The top-left and bottom-right corners are different.
  - There are changes within the first and last rows/columns.
  - The program correctly outputs 'YES'.

- **Test Case 8**:
  ```
  1 5
  WBBWB
  ```
  - The top-left and bottom-right corners are different.
  - There are changes within the first and last rows/columns.
  - The program correctly outputs 'NO'.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the provided test cases and adheres to the logic described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
