You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid. Following these integers, there are n lines, each containing a string of m characters ('W' or 'B') representing the initial colors of the squares in the grid. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the output is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop. The grid `gr` and the variables `n`, `m`, and `ans` are specific to each iteration and do not persist after the loop completes. The final output consists of `t` lines, each containing 'YES' or 'NO' corresponding to the result of each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with 'W' or 'B'. For each grid, it determines if it is possible to paint the grid such that all cells in the first row are the same color, all cells in the last row are the same color, all cells in the first column are the same color, and all cells in the last column are the same color, with the additional condition that the top-left and bottom-right cells must be the same color if the grid is to be painted in this manner. The function outputs 'YES' if such a painting is possible for each test case, otherwise it outputs 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if it is possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using the specified operations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and reasoning behind the program:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid, `n` (rows) and `m` (columns).
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing it as a list of strings where each string represents a row of the grid.

2. **Initial Assumption**:
   - The program assumes the answer is 'YES' initially, meaning it assumes it is possible to make all squares the same color.

3. **Checking Corner Colors**:
   - The program checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) are the same color.
   - If these two corners are different, it sets a flag `impossible` to `True`.

4. **Checking Rows and Columns**:
   - The program then checks if all squares in the first row are the same color and all squares in the last row are the same color.
   - Similarly, it checks if all squares in the first column are the same color and all squares in the last column are the same color.
   - If any of these checks fail (i.e., if there are differing colors within the same row or column), it sets `impossible` to `False`.

5. **Determining the Answer**:
   - If `impossible` remains `True` after checking the above conditions, it means that the grid cannot be made uniform using the given operations, and the answer is set to 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, the answer remains 'YES'.

### Analysis of Logic:

The logic behind the program is sound but somewhat limited. Here's why it works:

- If the top-left and bottom-right corners are different and there are no changes in color within the first and last rows and columns, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform because there would be no way to connect the different regions without changing the colors of the boundary rows or columns.
- However, the program does not fully account for all possible configurations. For example, it does not check the internal structure of the grid beyond the boundaries.

### Testing the Program:

Let's test the program with the provided example to ensure it works correctly:

- **Test Case 1**:
  ```
  2 1
  W
  B
  ```
  - The top-left and bottom-right corners are different.
  - There are no changes within the first and last rows/columns.
  - The program correctly outputs 'NO'.

- **Test Case 2**:
  ```
  6 6
  WWWWBW
  WBWWWW
  BBBWWW
  BWWWBB
  WWBWBB
  BBBWBW
  ```
  - The top-left and bottom-right corners are different.
  - There are changes within the first and last rows/columns.
  - The program correctly outputs 'YES'.

- **Test Case 3**:
  ```
  1 1
  W
  ```
  - The grid is already uniform.
  - The program correctly outputs 'YES'.

- **Test Case 4**:
  ```
  2 2
  BB
  BB
  ```
  - The grid is already uniform.
  - The program correctly outputs 'YES'.

- **Test Case 5**:
  ```
  3 4
  BWBW
  WBWB
  BWBW
  ```
  - The top-left and bottom-right corners are different.
  - There are changes within the first and last rows/columns.
  - The program correctly outputs 'YES'.

- **Test Case 6**:
  ```
  4 2
  BB
  BB
  WW
  WW
  ```
  - The top-left and bottom-right corners are different.
  - There are no changes within the first and last rows/columns.
  - The program correctly outputs 'NO'.

- **Test Case 7**:
  ```
  4 4
  WWBW
  BBWB
  WWBB
  BBBB
  ```
  - The top-left and bottom-right corners are different.
  - There are changes within the first and last rows/columns.
  - The program correctly outputs 'YES'.

- **Test Case 8**:
  ```
  1 5
  WBBWB
  ```
  - The top-left and bottom-right corners are different.
  - There are changes within the first and last rows/columns.
  - The program correctly outputs 'NO'.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the provided test cases and adheres to the logic described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
