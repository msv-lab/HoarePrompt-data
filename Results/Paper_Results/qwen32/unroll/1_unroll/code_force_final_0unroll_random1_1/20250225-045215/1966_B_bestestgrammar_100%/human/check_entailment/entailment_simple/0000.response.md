### Reasoning:

The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations. The provided program checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid have the same color. If they do, it immediately concludes that it's possible to make the entire grid the same color and outputs "YES". If they don't, it checks if the top row and the bottom row are uniform (all squares in the row are the same color) and if the leftmost and rightmost columns are uniform. If both conditions are satisfied, it outputs "YES", otherwise "NO".

However, this approach is not entirely correct. The program does not consider all possible scenarios where the grid can be made uniform. Here are a few edge cases and considerations:

1. **Uniform Rows and Columns**: Even if the top and bottom rows are uniform and the leftmost and rightmost columns are uniform, it doesn't guarantee that the entire grid can be made uniform. For example, consider a grid where the top row is all 'W' and the bottom row is all 'B', but the middle rows alternate between 'W' and 'B'. The program would incorrectly conclude "YES" because the top and bottom rows are uniform and the leftmost and rightmost columns are uniform.

2. **Single Color Grid**: If the grid is already uniform (all squares are the same color), the program correctly outputs "YES".

3. **Diagonal or Other Patterns**: The program does not account for diagonal patterns or other complex patterns where the grid can still be made uniform with the given operations.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not cover all possible scenarios where the grid can be made uniform. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
