Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a grid, followed by `n` lines of `m` characters each ('W' or 'B') representing the grid's initial colors. The function returns a result for each test case, which is not specified in the given information, but it is implied to be based on the analysis of the grid's colors.**
