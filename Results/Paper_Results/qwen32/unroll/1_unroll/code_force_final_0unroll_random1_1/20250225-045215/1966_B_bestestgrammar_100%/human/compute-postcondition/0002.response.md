Output State: **The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the output is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop. The grid `gr` and the variables `n`, `m`, and `ans` are specific to each iteration and do not persist after the loop completes. The final output consists of `t` lines, each containing 'YES' or 'NO' corresponding to the result of each test case.**
