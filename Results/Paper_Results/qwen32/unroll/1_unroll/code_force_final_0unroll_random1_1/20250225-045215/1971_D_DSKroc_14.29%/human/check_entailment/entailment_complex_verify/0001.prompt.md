You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        print(count + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single binary string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        
        print(count + 1)
        
    #State: For each binary string `s`, the output is the count of segments where a '1' is followed by a '0', plus one. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and each binary string `s` is processed individually to produce a corresponding output value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of binary strings, each representing a test case, and outputs the count of segments where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0', plus one for each string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of contiguous pieces a binary string must be cut into so that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's before all '1's).

The provided program works as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads a binary string.
3. It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
4. It iterates through the binary string, checking each pair of adjacent characters.
5. If it finds a '1' followed by a '0' (i.e., `s[i] > s[i + 1]`), it increments the `count`.
6. Finally, it prints `count + 1` as the result.

The logic behind the program is that each transition from '1' to '0' indicates a point where a cut must be made to ensure that all '0's can be moved before all '1's in the rearranged string. The number of such cuts is equal to the number of '10' transitions plus one (since the pieces need to be contiguous and the entire string needs to be considered).

Let's verify this with the given example inputs:

1. **Input:** `11010`
   - Transitions from '1' to '0': `11[0]10` and `110[1]0`
   - Number of cuts: 2
   - Total pieces: 2 + 1 = 3 (Correct)

2. **Input:** `00000000`
   - No transitions from '1' to '0'
   - Number of cuts: 0
   - Total pieces: 0 + 1 = 1 (Correct)

3. **Input:** `1`
   - No transitions from '1' to '0'
   - Number of cuts: 0
   - Total pieces: 0 + 1 = 1 (Correct)

4. **Input:** `10`
   - Transition from '1' to '0': `1[0]`
   - Number of cuts: 1
   - Total pieces: 1 + 1 = 2 (Correct)

5. **Input:** `0001111`
   - No transitions from '1' to '0'
   - Number of cuts: 0
   - Total pieces: 0 + 1 = 1 (Correct)

6. **Input:** `0110`
   - Transitions from '1' to '0': `01[1]0`
   - Number of cuts: 1
   - Total pieces: 1 + 1 = 2 (Correct)

The program correctly identifies the number of cuts needed in all the given test cases.
