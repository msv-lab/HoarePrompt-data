Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the minimum number of cuts needed to split a binary string into pieces that can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's). The provided program counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0' in the string and adds one to this count to determine the number of pieces needed.

Let's analyze the logic:
- A '1' followed by a '0' indicates a boundary where a cut is necessary to separate the '1's and '0's into different pieces.
- If there are no '1's followed by '0's, the string is already sorted, and no cuts are needed (resulting in 1 piece).

This logic aligns with the examples provided:
- For "11010", there are two transitions ('1' to '0' at positions 1 and 3), so the result is 2 + 1 = 3.
- For "00000000", there are no transitions, so the result is 0 + 1 = 1.
- For "1", there are no transitions, so the result is 0 + 1 = 1.
- For "10", there is one transition, so the result is 1 + 1 = 2.
- For "0001111", there are no transitions, so the result is 0 + 1 = 1.
- For "0110", there is one transition, so the result is 1 + 1 = 2.

The execution summary confirms that the function is correctly identifying the number of '1' to '0' transitions and adding one to determine the number of pieces.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
