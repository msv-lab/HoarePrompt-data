To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding the maximum possible GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of a set of `n` positive integers that sum up to `x`. The GCD of these integers will be maximized if we can find a common divisor `d` such that `x` can be evenly distributed into `n` parts, each being a multiple of `d`.

### Key Observations

1. **Divisibility Check**: For a number `d` to be a possible GCD, `x` must be divisible by `d`. This is because if `x` is not divisible by `d`, we cannot partition `x` into `n` parts where each part is a multiple of `d`.

2. **Feasibility Check**: Once `d` divides `x`, we need to check if we can partition `x` into `n` parts where each part is a multiple of `d`. This translates to checking if `(x / d) - n` is non-negative and divisible by `d`.

3. **Iterate Over Possible Divisors**: To find the maximum possible GCD, we should iterate over all possible divisors of `x` and check the above conditions.

### Program Analysis

The provided program does the following:

1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.

2. **Finding Maximum GCD**:
   - It initializes `ans` to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD.
   - It iterates over all numbers from 1 to the square root of `x` (inclusive) to find divisors of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`.
     - It then checks if `(x - n * i) >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`. If both conditions are satisfied, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - Similarly, it checks for the complement divisor `x // i` (if `x // i > 0`), and updates `ans` if the conditions are satisfied.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum GCD found.

### Correctness Verification

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible GCD. It considers all possible divisors of `x` and checks the feasibility of partitioning `x` into `n` parts with each part being a multiple of the divisor. The use of the square root optimization ensures that the program runs efficiently even for the upper constraint of `x = 10^8`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly solves the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
