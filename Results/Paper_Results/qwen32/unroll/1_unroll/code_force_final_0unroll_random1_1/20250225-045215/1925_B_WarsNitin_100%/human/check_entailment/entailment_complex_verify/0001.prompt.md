You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, x and n are integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.

                    ans = max(ans, i)

                    i) == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: For each test case, `ans` is the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `x` and `n`. For each test case, it finds the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`, and prints this divisor.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding the maximum possible GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of a set of `n` positive integers that sum up to `x`. The GCD of these integers will be maximized if we can find a common divisor `d` such that `x` can be evenly distributed into `n` parts, each being a multiple of `d`.

### Key Observations

1. **Divisibility Check**: For a number `d` to be a possible GCD, `x` must be divisible by `d`. This is because if `x` is not divisible by `d`, we cannot partition `x` into `n` parts where each part is a multiple of `d`.

2. **Feasibility Check**: Once `d` divides `x`, we need to check if we can partition `x` into `n` parts where each part is a multiple of `d`. This translates to checking if `(x / d) - n` is non-negative and divisible by `d`.

3. **Iterate Over Possible Divisors**: To find the maximum possible GCD, we should iterate over all possible divisors of `x` and check the above conditions.

### Program Analysis

The provided program does the following:

1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.

2. **Finding Maximum GCD**:
   - It initializes `ans` to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD.
   - It iterates over all numbers from 1 to the square root of `x` (inclusive) to find divisors of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`.
     - It then checks if `(x - n * i) >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`. If both conditions are satisfied, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - Similarly, it checks for the complement divisor `x // i` (if `x // i > 0`), and updates `ans` if the conditions are satisfied.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum GCD found.

### Correctness Verification

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible GCD. It considers all possible divisors of `x` and checks the feasibility of partitioning `x` into `n` parts with each part being a multiple of the divisor. The use of the square root optimization ensures that the program runs efficiently even for the upper constraint of `x = 10^8`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly solves the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
