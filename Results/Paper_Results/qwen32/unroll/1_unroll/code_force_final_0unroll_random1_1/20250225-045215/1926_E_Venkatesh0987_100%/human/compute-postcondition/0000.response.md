The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the value from `int(input())`, which is derived from `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The variables `n` and `k` are mentioned as part of the problem description but are not directly in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given that the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is set correctly. The state before the loop should reflect that `t` is an integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4**
