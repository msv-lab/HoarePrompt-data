Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to verify its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order based on multiples of odd numbers.
- First, all odd-numbered cards (1, 3, 5, ...) are laid down.
- Then, cards that are twice an odd number (2, 6, 10, ...) are laid down.
- This continues with multiples of 3, 4, and so on.
- We need to determine the `k`-th card laid down for given `n` and `k`.

### Program Breakdown:
The program processes each test case as follows:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `s`: Sum of cards laid down.
   - `i`: Current step (starting from 0).
   - `d`: Remaining cards to be laid down.
   - `h`: Initial value of `d` (same as `n`).
   - `p`: Counter for steps.
   - `g`: Sum of cards laid down in previous steps.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - If `k <= (n + 1) // 2`, it directly computes the `k`-th odd number as `2 * k - 1`.
   - If `k > (n + 1) // 2`, it calculates the step `i` where the `k`-th card falls into by decrementing the count of available cards in each step.
   - It then calculates the `k`-th card based on the step `i` and the position within that step as `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`.

### Annotations and Reasoning:
- **Initialization**: The variables are set up correctly to track the progress of laying down cards.
- **Odd Numbers**: For `k <= (n + 1) // 2`, the program correctly computes the `k`-th odd number (`2 * k - 1`).
- **Subsequent Steps**:
  - The program uses a while loop to determine the step `i` where the `k`-th card falls into by decrementing the count of available cards in each step.
  - It then calculates the position `f` within that step and computes the `k`-th card as `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`.

### Example Walkthrough:
- **Example 1**: For `n = 7` and `k = 5`:
  - The first 4 cards are `1, 3, 5, 7`.
  - The 5th card is the first card that is twice an odd number, which is `2`.
  - The program correctly identifies this as `2`.

### Verification:
- **Odd Numbers**: The program correctly computes the first `(n + 1) // 2` cards as `2 * k - 1` for `k` from 1 to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- **Subsequent Steps**: For `k > (n + 1) // 2`, the program correctly calculates the step `i` and the position `f` to determine the `k`-th card.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the `k`-th card laid down according to the problem description. The annotations and the program's behavior align with the expected results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
