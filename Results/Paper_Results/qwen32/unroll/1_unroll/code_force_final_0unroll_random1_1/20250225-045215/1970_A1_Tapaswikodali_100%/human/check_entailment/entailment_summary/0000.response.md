### Reasoning:
Let's break down the provided code and verify if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

1. **Class Definition (`BalanceInfo`)**:
   - The class `BalanceInfo` is used to store the balance, position, and character of each parenthesis in the input string.
   - This class is essential for maintaining the balance and position information for each character in the sequence.

2. **Sorting Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is a comparator function used for sorting `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It sorts primarily by `balance` and secondarily by `position` in reverse order (larger positions come first when balances are equal).
   - This comparator aligns with the requirement to sort by prefix balance first and by position in decreasing order if the balances are the same.

3. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` takes a balanced parentheses sequence `s` as input.
   - It calculates the balance for each prefix of the sequence and stores it in a list of `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - The list `balance_info` is then sorted using the comparator function `func_1`.
   - Finally, the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list are joined to form the result string, which is printed.

### Verification:
- **Balanced Sequence**: The input sequence is guaranteed to be balanced, so the balance calculation will always start and end at zero.
- **Sorting**: The sorting step correctly implements the required order based on the balance and position.
- **Output**: The final output is generated by joining the characters from the sorted list of `BalanceInfo` objects, which ensures that the output sequence is the balanced shuffle as defined.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions together correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
