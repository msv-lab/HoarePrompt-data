The code snippet assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n`. Given that `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", and it represents a balanced parentheses sequence, the length of `s` is a specific integer value. The precondition that `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence and consists only of "(" and ")" remains valid after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", and the string represents a balanced parentheses sequence; `n` is the length of `s`.**
