The function takes two objects, `infoA` and `infoB`, each with attributes `balance` and `position`. It returns the difference between the `balance` of `infoA` and `infoB` if their balances are not equal. If their balances are equal, it returns the difference between the `position` of `infoB` and `infoA`.
