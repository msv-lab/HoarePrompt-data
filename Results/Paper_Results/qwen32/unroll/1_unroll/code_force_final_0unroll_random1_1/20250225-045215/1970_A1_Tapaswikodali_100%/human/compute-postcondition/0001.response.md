The code snippet initializes an empty list named `balance_info`. This action does not affect the values of `s` or `n`. Therefore, the string `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", representing a balanced parentheses sequence, and `n` remains the length of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", and the string represents a balanced parentheses sequence; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is an empty list.**
