To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **func_1**: This function is defined to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position. However, it's not used in the provided `func_2` function. It seems to be a redundant function if it's not called anywhere else in the code.

2. **func_2**: This function performs the following steps:
   - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store the balance, position, and character for each position in the input string `s`.
   - It calculates the balance of the prefix for each position in the string and appends a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info`.
   - It sorts the `balance_info` list using a lambda function as the key. The lambda function sorts primarily by balance in ascending order and secondarily by position in descending order (achieved by using `-x.position`).
   - It constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list.
   - Finally, it prints the result string.

The logic in `func_2` matches the steps described in the problem statement for performing the balanced shuffle operation. Therefore, if `BalanceInfo` is correctly defined to store the balance, position, and character, the program should correctly compute the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

However, the program is missing the definition of the `BalanceInfo` class or structure. Here is a possible definition of `BalanceInfo`:

```python
class BalanceInfo:
    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
```

If we assume that `BalanceInfo` is correctly defined as above, the program should work as intended.

**Conclusion**: Given the problem statement and the provided program, assuming the correct definition of `BalanceInfo`, the program appears to be correct.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
