Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase English letters. For each string, it checks if the string contains exactly two distinct characters. If it does, the function outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it outputs 'YES' and then prints either the lexicographically smallest or largest version of the string, depending on whether the string is already in lexicographically smallest order.**
