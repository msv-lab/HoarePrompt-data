Correctness: **False**

The given program is not entirely correct for all cases. Specifically, it incorrectly handles the case where the input string has exactly two distinct characters. For example, consider the string "xxxy". The program will output "NO" for this string because it has exactly two distinct characters ('x' and 'y'), but it is possible to rearrange "xxxy" to "xyxx", "xxyx", or "yxxx", which are different from the original string.

The program should check if it is possible to rearrange the string to something different, not just rely on the number of distinct characters. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        # Try to find a different permutation
        found = False
        for j in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[j] != s[0]:
                # Swap the first character with a different one
                r = s[1:j] + s[0] + s[j+1:] + s[j]
                print('YES')
                print(r)
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

This version attempts to find a different permutation by swapping the first character with a different character in the string. If no such swap can be made, it correctly outputs "NO".
