You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Product Remainder:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the product of elements and takes the remainder. It appends elements to the list `b` based on the command ('L' or 'R') and then calculates the product of the reversed `b` list. This approach is incorrect because the product should be calculated based on the current state of the array `a` at each step, not based on the order of elements removed.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Commands:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the commands 'L' and 'R'. It appends elements to `b` based on the command but does not modify the array `a` accordingly. The array `a` should be modified by removing the leftmost or rightmost element as per the command.

3. **Incorrect Order of Outputs:**
   - The program appends elements to `b` in the order they are removed but calculates the product in reverse order. The product should be calculated based on the current state of the array `a` from the beginning of the command execution to the end.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Calculate the product of the current state of the array `a` at each step.
- Take the remainder of the product when divided by `m`.
- Output the remainder before modifying the array based on the command.
- Modify the array by removing the leftmost or rightmost element as per the command.

Correctness: **False**

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    result = []
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        product = product * a[i] % m
        result.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a = a[1:]
        else:
            a = a[:-1]
    print(*result)
```

This corrected version calculates the product of the current state of the array `a` at each step, takes the remainder when divided by `m`, and outputs the remainder before modifying the array based on the command.
