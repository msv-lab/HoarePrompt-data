Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the product of the array elements and take the remainder as per the problem description. Specifically, the program incorrectly constructs the array `b` by appending elements based on the commands, but it does not calculate the product of the current array state and take the remainder `m` at each step.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Construction of `b`**: The program constructs an array `b` by appending elements based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'. However, `b` is not used correctly to compute the product of the current array state.

2. **Incorrect Product Calculation**: The product of the array elements should be calculated after each command is processed, and the remainder when divided by `m` should be output at each step. The current implementation calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, which is not what is required.

3. **Incorrect Output**: The output should be the remainder of the product of the current array state after each command, not the remainder of the product of elements in `b`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        product = product * a[i] % m
        print(product, end=' ')
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a = a[1:]
        else:
            a = a[:-1]
    print()
```

In the corrected version, the product of the current array state is calculated and the remainder when divided by `m` is printed after each command. The array `a` is modified according to the command ('L' or 'R').

However, since the original program does not meet the requirements as described, the correctness is **False**.
