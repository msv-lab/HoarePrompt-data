The code snippet initializes an empty list `ans`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers of length n where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list of length n containing elements from `a` in an order determined by the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`; `l` is n, `r` is -1; `ans` is an empty list.**
