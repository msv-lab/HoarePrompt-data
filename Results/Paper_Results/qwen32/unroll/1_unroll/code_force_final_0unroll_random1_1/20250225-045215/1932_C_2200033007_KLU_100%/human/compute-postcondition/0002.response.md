The code assigns the value of `n - 1` to the variable `r`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers of length n where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is an empty list; `l` is 0; `r` is n - 1.**
