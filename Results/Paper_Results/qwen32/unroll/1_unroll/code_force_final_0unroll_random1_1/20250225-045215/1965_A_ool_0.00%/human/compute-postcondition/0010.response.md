The code `A = not A` flips the boolean value of `A`. If `A` was `True`, it becomes `False`, and if `A` was `False`, it becomes `True`. The precondition about `not_c` and the set_ is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **A is the opposite of its initial value, not_c is True, meaning no consecutive elements in set_ have a difference greater than 1.**
