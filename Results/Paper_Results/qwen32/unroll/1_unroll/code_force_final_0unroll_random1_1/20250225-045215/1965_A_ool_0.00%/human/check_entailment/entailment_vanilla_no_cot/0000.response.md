Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed and does not properly implement the optimal strategy for the game.

The game described is a variant of the Nim Game, where the key to determining the winner is based on the binary XOR of the pile sizes. If the XOR of all pile sizes is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy. If it is zero, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy, assuming both play optimally.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().rstrip())
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    xor_sum = 0
    for a in arr:
        xor_sum ^= a
    if xor_sum == 0:
        print("Bob")
    else:
        print("Alice")
```

This corrected version computes the XOR of all pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the result is zero or not.
