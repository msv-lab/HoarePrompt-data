Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program code, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given that each sign i occurs every a_i years, and each subsequent sign must occur strictly after the previous one. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a list of periodicities for the signs.

### Program Code Analysis
The provided code reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the year of the n-th sign's occurrence as follows:
1. **Input Reading**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of signs and their periodicities.
2. **Logic for Calculating the Year**:
   - It initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - For each sign with periodicity `ai`, it calculates the next year the sign will occur:
     - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the next multiple of `ai` greater than `current_year` using `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - It updates `current_year` to this next occurrence year and moves to the next sign.
3. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, it outputs the year of the n-th sign's occurrence.

### Function Summary
The function summary states that the function calculates the first common year when all signs change for each test case, given the periodicities of the signs, and returns a list of these years. However, this summary is misleading because the function actually calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs in sequence, not the first common year for all signs.

### Original Assessment Analysis
The original assessment claims that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The explanation provided in the assessment is accurate in describing how the program works and how it ensures the signs occur in sequence. The assessment also mentions that the program handles edge cases correctly and that the provided examples work as expected.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs, following the rules specified in the problem description. The function summary, while not entirely clear, does not contradict the correct behavior of the program.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
