To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's analyze what the code does step-by-step.

The code iterates over each test case in the `test_cases` list. For each test case, it calculates the first common year when all signs (periodicities specified in the list `a`) change. Here's how it works:

1. Initialize `current_year` to 0.
2. For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`:
   - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next year when this sign changes is `current_year + ai`.
   - Otherwise, the next year is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
3. Update `current_year` to this next year.
4. After processing all periodicities in the list `a`, append the final `current_year` to the `results` list.

After all test cases are processed, the `results` list will contain the first common year when all signs change for each test case.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `test_cases` is a list of `t` test cases, each being a tuple (n, a).
- `results` is an empty list.

The output state will have the `results` list populated with the calculated years for each test case.

Output State: **`results` is a list of `t` integers, where each integer is the first common year when all signs change for the corresponding test case.**
