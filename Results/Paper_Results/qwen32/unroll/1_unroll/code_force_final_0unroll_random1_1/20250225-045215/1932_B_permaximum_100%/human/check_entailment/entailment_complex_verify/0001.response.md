### Reasoning:

Let's systematically verify the correctness of the provided program using the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign can only occur after the previous one has occurred.

#### Solution Analysis:
Let's break down the solution provided in the `func_1` function:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `current_year` is initialized to 0, representing the starting point in time.

2. **Processing Each Sign**:
   - For each sign's periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, the program calculates the next occurrence of the sign.
   - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence is `current_year + ai`.
   - If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next occurrence is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`. This is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
   - `current_year` is then updated to this next occurrence.

3. **Result Collection**:
   - After processing all signs in a test case, the final `current_year` is the year in which the n-th sign occurs, and this value is appended to the `results` list.

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the solution with the first example provided:

- **Input**: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- **Processing**:
  - Start at year 0.
  - First sign: `current_year = 3` (next multiple of 3 after 0).
  - Second sign: `current_year = 4` (next multiple of 2 after 3).
  - Third sign: `current_year = 8` (next multiple of 4 after 4).
  - Fourth sign: `current_year = 10` (next multiple of 5 after 8).
  - Fifth sign: `current_year = 18` (next multiple of 9 after 10).
  - Sixth sign: `current_year = 36` (next multiple of 18 after 18).
- **Output**: `36`

The program correctly computes the year in which the n-th sign occurs for the given example.

#### Additional Verification:
Let's verify with another example:

- **Input**: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5`
- **Processing**:
  - Start at year 0.
  - First sign: `current_year = 1` (next multiple of 1 after 0).
  - Second sign: `current_year = 2` (next multiple of 2 after 1).
  - Third sign: `current_year = 3` (next multiple of 3 after 2).
  - Fourth sign: `current_year = 4` (next multiple of 4 after 3).
  - Fifth sign: `current_year = 5` (next multiple of 5 after 4).
- **Output**: `5`

The program correctly computes the year in which the n-th sign occurs for this example as well.

#### Annotations:
The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code align with the reasoning and calculations described above. The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, and they match the expected behavior of the program as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Based on the problem description, the provided solution in the `func_1` function, and the annotations, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign and the requirement for sequential occurrences.

**Correctness: True**

Final: **True**
