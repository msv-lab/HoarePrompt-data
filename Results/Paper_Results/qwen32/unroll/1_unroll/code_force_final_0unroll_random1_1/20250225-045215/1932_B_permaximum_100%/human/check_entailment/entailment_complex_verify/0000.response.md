Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program code, and the annotations to evaluate the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur.
- Each sign i occurs every a_i years.
- Signs must occur sequentially, meaning the i-th sign must occur strictly after the (i-1)-th sign.

### Provided Program Code:
```python
t = int(input().strip())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    test_cases.append((n, a))
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        (n, a) = test
        current_year = 0
        for ai in a:
            if current_year % ai == 0:
                next_year = current_year + ai
            else:
                next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
            current_year = next_year
        results.append(current_year)
    return results
```

### Annotations Recap:
- The annotations confirm that the state of the program before the function call is correct, with `t` being the number of test cases and `test_cases` being a list of tuples containing the number of signs `n` and their periodicities `a`.
- Inside `func_1`, for each test case, `current_year` is initialized to 0.
- For each periodicity `ai`, the program calculates `next_year` such that it is the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`.
- `current_year` is updated to `next_year` for each sign, ensuring the signs occur sequentially.
- The final `current_year` after processing all signs is appended to `results`.

### Original Assessment Recap:
- The original assessment states that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
- It correctly handles the input, calculates the year for each sign sequentially, and outputs the correct year for the n-th sign.

### Evaluation:
Let's verify the logic step-by-step using the annotations and the provided examples.

#### Example 1:
- Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- Expected Output: `36`
- Calculation:
  - Start at `current_year = 0`
  - For `ai = 3`: `next_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`, `current_year = 3`
  - For `ai = 2`: `next_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`, `current_year = 4`
  - For `ai = 4`: `next_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`, `current_year = 8`
  - For `ai = 5`: `next_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`, `current_year = 10`
  - For `ai = 9`: `next_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`, `current_year = 18`
  - For `ai = 18`: `next_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`, `current_year = 36`
- The output matches the expected result.

#### Example 2:
- Input: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5`
- Expected Output: `5`
- Calculation:
  - Start at `current_year = 0`
  - For `ai = 1`: `next_year = 0 + 1 = 1`, `current_year = 1`
  - For `ai = 2`: `next_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`, `current_year = 2`
  - For `ai = 3`: `next_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`, `current_year = 3`
  - For `ai = 4`: `next_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`, `current_year = 4`
  - For `ai = 5`: `next_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`, `current_year = 5`
- The output matches the expected result.

#### Example 3:
- Input: `5`, `1 1 1 1 1`
- Expected Output: `5`
- Calculation:
  - Start at `current_year = 0`
  - For `ai = 1`: `next_year = 0 + 1 = 1`, `current_year = 1`
  - For `ai = 1`: `next_year = 1 + 1 = 2`, `current_year = 2`
  - For `ai = 1`: `next_year = 2 + 1 = 3`, `current_year = 3`
  - For `ai = 1`: `next_year = 3 + 1 = 4`, `current_year = 4`
  - For `ai = 1`: `next_year = 4 + 1 = 5`, `current_year = 5`
- The output matches the expected result.

#### Example 4:
- Input: `6`, `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
- Expected Output: `2012`
- Calculation:
  - Start at `current_year = 0`
  - For `ai = 50`: `next_year = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`, `current_year = 50`
  - For `ai = 30`: `next_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`, `current_year = 60`
  - For `ai = 711`: `next_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`, `current_year = 711`
  - For `ai = 200`: `next_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`, `current_year = 800`
  - For `ai = 503`: `next_year = (800 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`, `current_year = 1006`
  - For `ai = 1006`: `next_year = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`, `current_year = 2012`
- The output matches the expected result.
