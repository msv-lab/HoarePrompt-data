To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for c in range(cases)`. The variables `c` and `cases` are the only ones we can adjust.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `cases`**: This variable determines how many times the loop will iterate. For the loop to execute at least once, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1.
2. **Variable `c`**: This variable is the loop counter and will automatically be initialized to 0 by the `range` function when the loop starts. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `c` before the loop starts.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, it does not directly affect the execution of the loop. It seems to be an unrelated variable in this context.

Thus, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `cases` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1**
