Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (with `m <= n`), and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost required to reach a specified final position, considering the costs provided in lists `a` and `b`.**
