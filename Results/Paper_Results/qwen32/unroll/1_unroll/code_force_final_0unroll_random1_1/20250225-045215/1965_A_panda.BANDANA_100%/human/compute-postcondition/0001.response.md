In the given task, the only variable in the loop head is `i`, and `t` is the controlling variable that determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1, as `i` will iterate from 0 to `t-1`. The variable `i` itself does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
