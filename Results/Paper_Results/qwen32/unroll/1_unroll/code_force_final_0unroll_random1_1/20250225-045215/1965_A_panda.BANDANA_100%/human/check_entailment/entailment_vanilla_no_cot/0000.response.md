Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given rules. The game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) from combinatorial game theory, specifically for impartial games like this one. The key insight is that the game is equivalent to a Nim game where the piles are the stones in the piles, and the moves are equivalent to removing the same number of stones from each non-empty pile. The winner can be determined by calculating the XOR of all pile sizes. If the XOR is non-zero, Alice (the first player) has a winning strategy; otherwise, Bob (the second player) has a winning strategy.

Here is a corrected version of the program using this approach:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = map(int, input().split())
        nim_sum = 0
        for stones in l:
            nim_sum ^= stones
        if nim_sum != 0:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

func()
```

This program calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes for each test case and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is non-zero or zero.
