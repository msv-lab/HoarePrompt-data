Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" forming a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns a string `result` which is a permutation of the original string `s` based on the sorting criteria of `prefix_balance`.**
