t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, and m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000. Additionally, s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.
