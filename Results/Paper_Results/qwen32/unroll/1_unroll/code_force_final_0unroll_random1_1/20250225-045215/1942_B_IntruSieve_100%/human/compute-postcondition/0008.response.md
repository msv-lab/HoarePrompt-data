To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to focus on the given loop and how it interacts with the provided initial state.

The loop provided is:
```python
for itm in mex:
    print(itm, end=' ')
```

This loop iterates over each element in the `mex` list and prints it, separated by a space. The variables `minn` and `used` are not modified or used within the loop body, so they will remain unchanged.

Given the Initial State:
- `mex`: A list containing some "calculated values" based on `arr`.
- `minn`: The smallest unused non-negative integer.
- `used`: A dictionary of used integers.

Since the loop only prints the values in `mex` and does not modify `minn` or `used`, the output state will be the same as the initial state except for the printed output, which is not a part of the state variables.

Output State: **mex: [calculated values based on arr], minn: smallest unused non-negative integer, used: {dict of used integers}**.

In natural language: The output state will have the same `mex`, `minn`, and `used` values as the initial state, as the loop only prints the elements of `mex` and does not alter any of the state variables.
