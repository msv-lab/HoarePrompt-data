Reasoning:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to construct the permutation `p` from the array `a`. The key issue lies in how the `mex` values are being calculated and used to construct the permutation `p`.

The program is supposed to construct `p` such that for each `i`, `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`. However, the current implementation does not properly determine the `p[i]` values based on the `a[i]` values and the `MEX` condition. Instead, it attempts to directly compute the `mex` values based on the `a[i]` values, which is not the correct approach.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the correct approach:

1. **Initialize a set of available numbers**: Start with a set of all numbers from `0` to `n-1` that are available to be used in the permutation `p`.

2. **Iterate through the array `a`**: For each `a[i]`, determine the `MEX` of the current permutation `p` (which is initially empty). The `MEX` is the smallest non-negative integer not in the current permutation.

3. **Determine `p[i]`**: For each `a[i]`, calculate `p[i]` as `MEX - a[i]`. This ensures that `a[i] = MEX - p[i]` holds true.

4. **Update the set of available numbers**: After determining `p[i]`, remove it from the set of available numbers.

5. **Output the permutation `p`**: After processing all elements in `a`, output the constructed permutation `p`.

The provided code does not follow this correct approach. Instead, it attempts to directly compute the `mex` values based on the `a[i]` values, which does not correctly satisfy the `MEX` condition.

Therefore, the current implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
