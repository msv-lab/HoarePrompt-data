Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), the length of the permutation p and the array a. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), the elements of array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input; `mex` is an empty list; `minn` is 0; `used` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] > 0:
        mex.append(minn)
        used[minn] = True
        while minn in used:
            minn += 1
    else:
        mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
        used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
