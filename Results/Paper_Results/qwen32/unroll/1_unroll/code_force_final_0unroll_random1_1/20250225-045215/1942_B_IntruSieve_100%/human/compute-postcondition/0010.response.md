Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of a permutation `p` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function processes the array `a` and returns a valid permutation `p` of the integers from 1 to `n` based on the elements of `a`.**
