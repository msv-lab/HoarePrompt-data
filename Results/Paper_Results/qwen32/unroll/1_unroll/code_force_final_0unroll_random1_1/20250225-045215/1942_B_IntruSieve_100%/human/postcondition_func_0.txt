The function `func_1` processes each test case consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a sequence of integers `mex` based on the values in `a` and prints this sequence. The sequence `mex` is derived such that for each positive element in `a`, it appends the smallest unused non-negative integer to `mex`, and for each non-positive element, it appends the absolute difference between the element and the smallest unused non-negative integer. After processing each test case, it prints the sequence `mex` followed by a newline.
