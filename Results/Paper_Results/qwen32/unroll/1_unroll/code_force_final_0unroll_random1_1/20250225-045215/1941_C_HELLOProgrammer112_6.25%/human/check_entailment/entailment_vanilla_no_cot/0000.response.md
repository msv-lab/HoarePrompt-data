Correctness: **False**

The provided program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in each test case and outputs their sum as the number of characters to be removed. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not account for overlapping substrings or the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie". 

For example, consider the string "mappie". The program would count 1 "map" and 1 "pie", resulting in an output of 2. However, only one deletion (removing the second 'p') is necessary to make the string beautiful.

A correct solution would require a more sophisticated approach, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm, to determine the minimum number of deletions needed to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string.
