Reasoning:
The provided program is not correct based on the problem statement and the execution summary. The task is to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful (i.e., free of the substrings "pie" and "map"). The current implementation simply counts the occurrences of these substrings and prints the sum, which does not solve the problem of finding the minimum number of deletions required.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find a way to remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate all occurrences of "pie" and "map". This involves a more complex algorithm, such as dynamic programming or a greedy approach, to ensure that we are making the optimal deletions.

For example, in the first test case with the string "mmapnapie", the program would output 2 because "map" appears once and "pie" appears once. However, to make the string beautiful, we need to remove only 2 characters, such as the 4th and 9th characters to get "mmnapie" or "mmapnaie". The current implementation does not account for this optimization.

Correctness: **False**
