In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `_` and the range is determined by the integer value of the input. The loop will execute once for each test case, where the number of test cases is specified by the variable `t`.

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the loop head variables. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the range, which is derived from the input `t`.

Since the loop will iterate `t` times, the only thing we need to ensure is that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. The variables `n` and `s` are mentioned in the problem description but are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted here.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1. The variables `n` and `s` are relevant to the loop body and will be defined within each iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` must be at least 1**
