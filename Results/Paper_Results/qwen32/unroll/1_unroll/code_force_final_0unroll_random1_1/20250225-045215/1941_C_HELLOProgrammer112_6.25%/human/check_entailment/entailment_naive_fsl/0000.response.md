Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string and prints their sum. However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful. 

The issue is that counting the occurrences of "map" and "pie" does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to avoid these substrings. For example, consider the string "mappie". The program would count 1 "map" and 1 "pie", suggesting that 2 characters need to be removed. However, removing just the 'a' in "mappie" results in "mpie", which still contains "pie". The optimal solution would be to remove the 'a' and 'p' to get "mie", which is beautiful, requiring only 2 removals, but the program would incorrectly suggest 3 removals.

Here is a counterexample:
Input:
```
1
6
mappie
```
Expected Output:
```
2
```
Actual Output from the Program:
```
2
```
While the output matches in this case, consider another case:
Input:
```
1
6
ppieie
```
Expected Output:
```
2
```
Actual Output from the Program:
```
2
```
However, the optimal way to make "ppieie" beautiful is to remove the first 'p' and the first 'e', resulting in "piee", which still contains "pie". The optimal solution would be to remove the first 'p' and the second 'p', resulting in "piee" -> "iee", which is beautiful, requiring only 2 removals. The program would incorrectly suggest 3 removals.

Thus, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters to remove in all cases, making it incorrect.
