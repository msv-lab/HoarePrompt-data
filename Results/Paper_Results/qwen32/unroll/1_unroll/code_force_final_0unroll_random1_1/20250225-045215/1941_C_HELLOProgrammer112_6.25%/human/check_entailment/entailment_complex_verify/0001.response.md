### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string and sums these counts. However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following example:

- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  6
  mappie
  ```

- **Program Output:**
  ```
  2
  ```

- **Explanation:**
  - The program counts one occurrence of "map" and one occurrence of "pie", resulting in a total of 2.
  - However, removing the character 'a' at index 2 would result in the string "mpie", which still contains "pie".
  - The correct minimum number of characters to remove is 1 (removing 'a' at index 2), which would make the string "mpie" and then removing 'p' at index 0 would result in "mie", which is beautiful.

The program fails to consider the optimal way to remove characters to eliminate all occurrences of "map" and "pie". It simply sums the counts, which is not the correct approach for minimizing the number of deletions.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
