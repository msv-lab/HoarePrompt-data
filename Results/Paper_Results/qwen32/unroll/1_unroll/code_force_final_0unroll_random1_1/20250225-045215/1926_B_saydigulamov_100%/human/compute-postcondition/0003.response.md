Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and an `n x n` grid. The grid contains only '0's and '1's and includes exactly one triangle or one square made of '1's with size `k` greater than 1. The function returns the type of shape ('triangle' or 'square') and its size `k` for each test case.**
