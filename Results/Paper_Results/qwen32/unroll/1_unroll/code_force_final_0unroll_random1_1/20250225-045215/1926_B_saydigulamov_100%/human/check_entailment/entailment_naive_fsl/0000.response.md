Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape formed by the `1`s in the grid is a triangle or a square. The current logic only checks if the number of `1`s in the first two rows are equal, which is not sufficient to determine the shape accurately.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

**Counterexample Input:**
```
1
3
001
011
111
```

**Expected Output:**
```
TRIANGLE
```

**Actual Output:**
```
SQUARE
```

In this example, the grid forms a triangle, but the program incorrectly identifies it as a square because the number of `1`s in the first two rows are different (1 and 2, respectively), but the program only checks for equality in the first two rows and does not account for the pattern of `1`s in the subsequent rows.

To correctly determine the shape, the program needs to check the pattern of `1`s in all rows and ensure it matches the criteria for either a square or a triangle.
