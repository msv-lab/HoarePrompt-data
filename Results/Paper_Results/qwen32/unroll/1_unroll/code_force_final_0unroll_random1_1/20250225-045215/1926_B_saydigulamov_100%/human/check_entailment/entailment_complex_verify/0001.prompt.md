You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, and the grid is an n x n list of lists where each element is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that consists of all the '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1.

    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()

    #State: The output state after all iterations will be a series of 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' prints, depending on the shape represented by the input lines for each iteration. The state of `t`, `n`, and `grid` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an `n x n` grid of '0's and '1's. It determines whether the '1's in the grid form a square or a triangle and prints 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' accordingly for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

The problem requires us to determine if a given binary grid of size n x n contains a square or a triangle made of '1's. The program reads multiple test cases, each with a grid of '0's and '1's, and should output "SQUARE" if the grid contains a square, and "TRIANGLE" if it contains a triangle.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. `a = int(input())`: This reads the number of test cases.
2. The program then enters a loop that iterates `a` times.
3. For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and then reads `n` lines of the grid.
4. It initializes an empty list `k`.
5. For each line in the grid, if there are any '1's, it appends the count of '1's in that line to the list `k`.
6. After processing all lines of the grid, it checks if the first two elements of `k` are equal:
   - If they are equal, it prints "SQUARE".
   - Otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

The logic in the program is flawed. Here are the key issues:

- The check `if k[0] == k[1]:` is not sufficient to determine if the grid contains a square. A square requires all rows (or columns) to have the same number of '1's, not just the first two.
- The program does not handle upside-down triangles or triangles that are not centered in the grid.
- The program does not check if the counts of '1's in each row match the pattern of a triangle.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Check if all rows have the same number of '1's to determine if it's a square.
- Check if the number of '1's in each row follows the pattern of a triangle (1, 3, 5, 7, ...) or an upside-down triangle (..., 7, 5, 3, 1).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
