Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect due to the logic in `func_2`. The operations inside the while loop are not correctly implemented. Specifically, the lines:

```python
list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
```

are incorrect because they are using `list[i - 1]` multiple times without updating it properly within the loop. This results in an incorrect decrement of the values in the list.

The correct operation should be:

```python
list[i - 1] -= 1
list[i] -= 2
list[i + 1] -= 1
```

This operation should be repeated as long as the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0` are met.

Here is a corrected version of `func_2`:

```python
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i - 1] -= 1
            list[i] -= 2
            list[i + 1] -= 1
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

However, this corrected version still might not be sufficient to solve all cases correctly because the logic to determine if all elements can be made zero is not fully covered. Additional checks and logic might be required to handle all scenarios correctly.
