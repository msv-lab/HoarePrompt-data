### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem, the provided code, and the annotations to determine the correctness of the program. The goal is to determine if it's possible to reduce all elements of an array to zero using the specified operation.

**Problem Recap:**
We need to reduce all elements of the array to zero using the operation:
- Choose an index \( i \) such that \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \).
- Decrease \( a[i-1] \) by 1.
- Decrease \( a[i] \) by 2.
- Decrease \( a[i+1] \) by 1.

**Code Analysis:**
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly checks if the first `n` elements of the list are all zeros.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is not zero.
   - Otherwise, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function attempts to reduce the array elements to zero using the described operation.
   - It iterates over the array from the second element to the second last element (i.e., from index 1 to `n-2`).
   - For each element `a[i]` (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)), it enters a while loop that continues as long as `a[i] > 1` and both `a[i-1]` and `a[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - Inside the while loop, the program incorrectly modifies the elements of the array. Specifically, it does not correctly apply the operation. Instead of decreasing `a[i-1]` by 1, `a[i]` by 2, and `a[i+1]` by 1, it incorrectly subtracts `a[i-1]` times 1 from `a[i-1]`, `a[i]` times 2 from `a[i]`, and `a[i-1]` times 1 from `a[i+1]`. This is a logical error.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints "YES" if they are, otherwise it prints "NO".

**Annotations:**
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function calls.
- However, the annotations do not address the logical error in the implementation of the operation within `func_2`.

**Original Assessment:**
- The original assessment correctly identifies the logical error in `func_2` where the operation is not applied correctly.
- The assessment concludes that the program is incorrect due to this logical error.

**Final Decision:**
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program contains a logical error in the implementation of the operation, which makes it incorrect for the given problem.

### Final: **False**
