You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list).
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: the loop has finished executing without returning False.
    return True
    #The program returns True

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers, and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= len(list).
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
    #State: list = [0, 0, ..., 0, list[n-1], list[n], ..., list[len(list)-1]]
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list is structured such that the first `n` elements are all 0, and the remaining elements are integers. The function `func_1` returns `True` if the list and `n` meet a specific condition, otherwise it returns `False`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program contains a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation**:
   - The code in `func_2` is supposed to perform the operation described in the problem, but it incorrectly modifies the array. Specifically, the lines:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```
     The current implementation incorrectly subtracts multiples of `list[i - 1]` from the elements, which is not what the problem specifies.

2. **Logic for Checking All Elements to Zero**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero, which is correct. However, the logic in `func_2` does not ensure that the operations can make all elements zero. The operations should be applied in a way that all elements can potentially be reduced to zero, but the current implementation does not guarantee this.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the following test case:
```
5
1 3 5 5 2
```
The correct operations would be:
1. Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`
2. Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`
3. Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`
4. Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

However, with the current implementation, the operations will not be applied correctly, and the function will likely return "NO" for this case.

### Conclusion:
Due to the incorrect implementation of the operations and the logic to reduce the array elements to zero, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
