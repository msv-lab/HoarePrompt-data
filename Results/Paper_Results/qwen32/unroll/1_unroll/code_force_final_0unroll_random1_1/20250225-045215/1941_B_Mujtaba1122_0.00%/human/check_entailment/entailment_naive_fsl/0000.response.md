Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program contains a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation**:
   - The code in `func_2` is supposed to perform the operation described in the problem, but it incorrectly modifies the array. Specifically, the lines:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```
     The current implementation incorrectly subtracts multiples of `list[i - 1]` from the elements, which is not what the problem specifies.

2. **Logic for Checking All Elements to Zero**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero, which is correct. However, the logic in `func_2` does not ensure that the operations can make all elements zero. The operations should be applied in a way that all elements can potentially be reduced to zero, but the current implementation does not guarantee this.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the following test case:
```
5
1 3 5 5 2
```
The correct operations would be:
1. Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`
2. Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`
3. Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`
4. Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

However, with the current implementation, the operations will not be applied correctly, and the function will likely return "NO" for this case.

### Conclusion:
Due to the incorrect implementation of the operations and the logic to reduce the array elements to zero, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
