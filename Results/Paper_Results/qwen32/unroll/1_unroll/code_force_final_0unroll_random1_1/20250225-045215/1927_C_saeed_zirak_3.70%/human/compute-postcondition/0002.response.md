Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of two lists, `a` and `b`, respectively. It also accepts an even integer `k` such that 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m). The lists `a` and `b` consist of integers where each element in `a` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 and each element in `b` satisfies 1 <= b_j <= 10^6. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
