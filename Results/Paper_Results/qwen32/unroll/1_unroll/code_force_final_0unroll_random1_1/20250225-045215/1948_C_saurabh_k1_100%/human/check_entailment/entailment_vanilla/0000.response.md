Let's analyze the given program step by step and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The robot starts at position (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n). The robot can move either left, right, up, or down, and then it must follow the arrow in the cell it lands in. The goal is to determine if there exists a sequence of moves that allows the robot to reach (2, n).

### Key Observations:
1. The robot can move to (2, 1) from (1, 1) by moving down.
2. From (2, 1), the robot can only move right or left and then follow the arrow.
3. The robot needs to ensure that it can eventually reach (2, n) by navigating through the grid following the arrows.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks for specific conditions in the grid to determine if the robot can reach (2, n). Specifically, it iterates through the columns (starting from the second column and skipping every other column) and checks for certain configurations of arrows that would prevent the robot from reaching (2, n).

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic Flaw**: The program only checks for specific configurations of arrows (i.e., `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`) and concludes that the robot cannot reach (2, n) if these configurations are found. However, this logic is not sufficient to cover all possible scenarios where the robot might be able to reach (2, n).
   
2. **Missing Cases**: The program does not consider other possible moves and configurations that could allow the robot to reach (2, n). For example, it does not account for scenarios where the robot might need to move up or down multiple times or follow a different sequence of arrows.

3. **Output Case Sensitivity**: The program prints 'No' and 'yes' (with different cases), which is acceptable according to the problem statement, but the logic inside the program needs to be correct first.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
