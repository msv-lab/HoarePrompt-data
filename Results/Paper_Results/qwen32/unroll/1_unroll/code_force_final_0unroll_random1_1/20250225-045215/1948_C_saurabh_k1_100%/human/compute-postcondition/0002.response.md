To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the given code. The code processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it checks two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` (where `n` is even) for a specific pattern. If the pattern is found, it prints "No" and moves to the next test case. If the pattern is not found after checking all relevant positions, it prints "Yes".

The pattern being checked is whether there are any positions `i` (where `i` is odd) such that:
- `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<', or
- `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<'.

If such a pattern is found, it means there is a conflict in the direction of arrows, and the output for that test case is "No". If no such pattern is found, the output for that test case is "Yes".

Since the loop processes each test case independently and prints either "Yes" or "No" for each one, the final output state will be a series of "Yes" and "No" responses, one for each test case.

Given the initial state and the loop, the output state after all iterations will be a sequence of "Yes" and "No" responses corresponding to each test case.

Output State: **a sequence of "Yes" and "No" responses, one for each test case.**
