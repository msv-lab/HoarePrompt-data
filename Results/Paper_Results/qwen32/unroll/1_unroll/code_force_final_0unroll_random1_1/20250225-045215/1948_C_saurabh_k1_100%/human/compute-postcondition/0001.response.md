The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable that does not affect the loop's execution, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

Given the constraints, `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which means the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range.

So, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range to guarantee the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
