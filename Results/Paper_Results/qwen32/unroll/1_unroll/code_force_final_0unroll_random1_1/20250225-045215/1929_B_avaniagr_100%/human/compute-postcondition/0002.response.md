Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers: `n` (the size of the square grid) and `k` (the minimum number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell). The function returns a result indicating whether it is possible to color at least one cell in at least `k` diagonals of the `n x n` grid.**
