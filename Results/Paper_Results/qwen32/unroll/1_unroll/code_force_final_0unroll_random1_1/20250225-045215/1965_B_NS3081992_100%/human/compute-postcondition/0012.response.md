The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `ans`. No other variables are modified. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, and `bk` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n; `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix; `ans` is an empty list.**
