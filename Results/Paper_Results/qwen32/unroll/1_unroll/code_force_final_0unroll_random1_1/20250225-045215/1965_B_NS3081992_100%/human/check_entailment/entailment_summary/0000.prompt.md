Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` evaluates a dictionary `d` where each key maps to a list of integers, a list of integers `processing`, an integer `da` that is a key in the dictionary `d`, and a list of integers `rank`. It recursively processes the elements in the list associated with the key `da` in `d`. If the list contains only one element, it returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum value returned by recursive calls for each valid element in the list, updates the `rank` list at the index `da - 1` with this minimum value plus one, and returns this value plus one.

It returns a tuple containing the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, along with the GCD itself. If `b` is 0, it returns `(1, 0, a)`, indicating that the GCD is `a` and the coefficients are `1` and `0`.

''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` generates and prints a sequence of outputs, each corresponding to the processing of a test case. The number of test cases is determined by another function `func_10`, and each test case is processed by `func_14`. The output for each test case is printed on a new line.
