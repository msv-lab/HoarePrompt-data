You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Input Reading**: The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases and `func_14()` to process each test case. `func_14()` reads two integers `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Binary Representation**: The program converts `n` and `k` to their binary representations (`b` and `bk` respectively) to understand their bit positions.

3. **Handling k = 1**:
   - If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the program returns the sequence `[2]` which is correct because the only possible sums are `0` and `2` (not `1`).
   - For other values of `n` when `k == 1`, the program constructs a sequence `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ...]`. This sequence ensures that every sum from `1` to `n` can be formed except `1` itself.

4. **Handling k != 1**:
   - The program constructs a sequence starting with powers of `2` up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus one.
   - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure that the sum of the sequence up to this point is `k-1` (excluding `k`).
   - The program then adds `k+1` and `2*k+1` to the sequence. These values are chosen to avoid forming the sum `k` while still being able to form all sums up to `n`.
   - Finally, it adds the remaining powers of `2` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

5. **Output**: For each test case, the program outputs the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

### Verification of Conditions:
- **No Subsequence with Sum k**: The program specifically avoids creating a subsequence that sums to `k` by carefully choosing the values in the sequence.
- **All Sums from 1 to n (excluding k)**: The sequence constructed ensures that all sums from `1` to `n` can be formed except for `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the test cases as per the problem description. The logic for constructing the sequence is sound and ensures that the conditions are met.

**Correctness: True**
