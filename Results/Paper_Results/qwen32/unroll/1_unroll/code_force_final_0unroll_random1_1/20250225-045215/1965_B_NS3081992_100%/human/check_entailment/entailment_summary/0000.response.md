### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided code and its functions to determine if the program meets the problem description.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_7()` reads each test case, which consists of two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `func_14()` is responsible for generating the sequence `a` for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.
   - The function constructs a list `ans` that should satisfy the conditions of the problem:
     - For `k == 1` and `n == 2`, it directly returns `[2]`.
     - For other cases, it constructs the list `ans` by:
       - Adding powers of 2 up to a certain limit.
       - Including specific calculated values related to `k`.
       - Adding more powers of 2 to cover the remaining range.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The constructed list `ans` should ensure that:
     - There is no subsequence of `a` whose sum equals `k`.
     - For all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there is a subsequence of `a` whose sum equals `v`.

4. **Output Generation:**
   - `func_15()` iterates through each test case, calls `func_14()` to generate the sequence, and prints the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself.

### Analysis of `func_14()`:
- For `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the sequence `[2]` is returned. This satisfies the conditions since there is no subsequence summing to 1, and the only possible sum is 2.
- For other cases, the sequence is constructed by:
  - Including powers of 2 up to a certain limit.
  - Adding specific values to ensure that the sum `k` cannot be formed but all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.

### Verification:
- The constructed sequence ensures that:
  - All sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by selecting appropriate subsequences.
  - The sum `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.

### Conclusion:
The provided code and its functions correctly generate the sequence `a` that meets the problem's conditions for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
