Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `m`, which are the dimensions of a grid (both odd integers between 3 and 99), `grid`, a 2D list of strings representing the field, `elements`, a dictionary mapping strings to tuples of integers representing positions on the grid, `allPlayers`, a dictionary mapping player identifiers to boolean values indicating if they are carrying the Quaffle, `goal`, a list of lists of tuples of integers representing the positions of the goals for each team, and `points`, a list of two integers representing the scores of the red and blue teams. The function returns an updated state of the game based on these inputs.**
