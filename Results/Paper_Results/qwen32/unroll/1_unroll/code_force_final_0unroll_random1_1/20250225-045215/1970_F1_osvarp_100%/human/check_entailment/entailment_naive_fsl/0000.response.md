Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Global Variables and Scope Issues**:
   - The variables `goal` and `points` are used within the `func_1` function, but they are not defined within the scope of that function. They are defined in the global scope, which can lead to issues if the function is called multiple times or in different contexts.
   - The `mov` and `GoalName` dictionaries are used but not defined anywhere in the provided code. This will cause a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect Movement Handling**:
   - The movement logic is not correctly implemented. The `mov` dictionary, which should map movement commands ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') to coordinate changes, is not defined. This will cause a `NameError` when trying to access `mov[com]`.

3. **Incorrect Goal Checking**:
   - The `goalIn` function checks if a position is in the `goal` list, but `goal` is not defined within the scope of `func_1`. This will cause a `NameError`.
   - The `goalIn` function should return the index of the goal list (0 for red, 1 for blue) if the position is in a goal, otherwise -1. However, the function does not correctly handle the case when the position is not in either goal list.

4. **Incorrect Player and Quaffle Handling**:
   - The `allPlayers` dictionary is used to track which players are carrying the Quaffle, but it is not correctly updated when players catch or throw the Quaffle.
   - The code does not correctly handle the scenario where a player throws the Quaffle. The Quaffle should be moved to the middle of the field, but this is not implemented.
   - The code does not correctly handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal, which should result in the other team scoring a point.

5. **Incorrect Input Parsing**:
   - The code assumes that the input is read from `stdin`, but this is not always the case. The code should be more flexible in handling input sources.
   - The code does not correctly parse the actions for catching and throwing the Quaffle. Specifically, the `C` and `T` commands are not correctly handled.

6. **Incorrect Output Handling**:
   - The code does not correctly output the events of the game as described in the problem statement. For example, it does not correctly print the time and the team that scored a goal.
   - The code does not correctly print the final score at the end of the game.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
5
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 L
R0 L
R0 T
```

Expected output:
```
4 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1
```

However, the provided code will likely fail due to the issues mentioned above, such as undefined variables and incorrect handling of movements and actions.
