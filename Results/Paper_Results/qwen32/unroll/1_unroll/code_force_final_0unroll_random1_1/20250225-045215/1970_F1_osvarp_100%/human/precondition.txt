N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd. The field is a 2D list (grid) of size N x M, where each element is a pair of characters representing different entities on the field. The number of players P per team is an integer such that 1 ≤ P ≤ 10. T is an integer representing the number of steps in the game, where 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000. Each step is a string describing an action performed by an entity on the field, which can be a move (U, D, L, R), catching a ball (C), or throwing the Quaffle (T).
