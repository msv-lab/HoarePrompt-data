You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the array, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array. The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) indicating the number of test cases.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
        
    #State: ntest remains unchanged and all test cases have been processed, with the difference between the maximum and minimum values of each list printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the "beauty" of an array, which is defined as the sum of differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this sum, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

The best way to do this is to sort the array. When the array is sorted, the difference between consecutive elements will be maximized because the smallest element will be at the start and the largest element will be at the end. Thus, the maximum beauty will be the difference between the largest and the smallest element in the sorted array.

Let's analyze the provided program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (ntest).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (n) and the elements of the array (a).

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array is sorted using the `sort()` method.

3. **Calculating the Beauty:**
   - The beauty is calculated as the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array, which is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The calculated beauty for each test case is printed.

This approach is correct because the maximum beauty of the array can indeed be achieved by sorting the array and taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements. This ensures that the sum of differences between consecutive elements is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
