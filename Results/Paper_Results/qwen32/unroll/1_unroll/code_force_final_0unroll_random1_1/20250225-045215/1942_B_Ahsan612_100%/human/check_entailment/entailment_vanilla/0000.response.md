Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
We need to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that for each `i` from `1` to `n`, `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. Here, `MEX` stands for the Minimum EXcluded value, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the given array.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program aims to construct the permutation `p` from the array `a` as follows:
1. For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.
2. It initializes `res` (which will be the permutation `p`) with `None` values.
3. It initializes `mex` (the current MEX value) to `n`.
4. It iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`).
5. For each element `ar[i]` in `a`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
6. It updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `mex - ar[i]`.
7. Finally, it prints the constructed permutation `p`.

### Issues with the Program:
The main issue with the provided program is the incorrect handling of the `mex` value. The `mex` value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the constructed permutation `p` up to that point. However, the program incorrectly initializes `mex` to `n` and updates it based on the calculated `res[i]` without ensuring that the new `mex` is indeed the smallest non-negative integer not in the current `res`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly construct the permutation `p`, we should:
1. Initialize a set to keep track of the numbers already used in `p`.
2. Iterate over the array `a` from the beginning.
3. For each `a_i`, calculate the current `mex` as the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.
4. Set `p_i` to `mex - a_i`.
5. Add `p_i` to the set of used numbers.
6. Update the `mex` to the next smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the program's handling of the `mex` value, the program is not correct and will not always produce a valid permutation `p` for the given `a`.

Correctness: **False**
