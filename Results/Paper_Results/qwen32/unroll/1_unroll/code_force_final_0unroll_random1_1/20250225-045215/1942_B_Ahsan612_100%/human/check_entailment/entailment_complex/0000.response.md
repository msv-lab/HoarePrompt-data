### Reasoning:

The given Python program is intended to solve the problem of reconstructing a permutation `p` from an array `a` where `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The program iteratively constructs the permutation `p` by calculating each element `p_i` based on the provided `a_i` and the current MEX value.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of length `n`.
   - It initializes an empty result list `res` of length `n` and sets `mex` to `n`.

2. **Reverse Iteration**:
   - The program iterates over the list `a` in reverse order (from the last element to the first).
   - For each element `ar[i]` in the reversed list, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - If the calculated `res[i]` is less than the current `mex`, it updates `mex` to `res[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `res` for a test case, it prints the elements of `res` as a space-separated string.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Reverse Iteration**:
  - The reverse iteration ensures that when calculating `res[i]`, the MEX value (`mex`) is the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `res` up to that point.
  - By updating `mex` only when a smaller value is found, the program ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest unused integer, which aligns with the definition of MEX.

- **Handling of MEX**:
  - The initial value of `mex` is set to `n`, which is the largest possible value for any element in `p`.
  - As the program iterates and updates `mex`, it correctly maintains the smallest unused integer, ensuring that the constructed permutation `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly reconstructs a valid permutation `p` for each test case based on the given array `a`. It handles the constraints and requirements of the problem efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
