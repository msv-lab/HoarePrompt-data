### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the array `a` according to the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis:

1. **Incorrect Approach**:
   - The program iterates from the end of the array `a` to the beginning, calculating `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]` and updating `mex` if necessary. However, this approach does not guarantee that the constructed `p` will be a valid permutation.
   - The `mex` value is not correctly maintained, and the logic does not ensure that the resulting `res` is a permutation of numbers from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `1 5 1 1 -2 1 2`, the expected output is `0 1 4 2 3`.
   - The provided code will produce `5 4 7 3 1`, which is incorrect because it does not form a valid permutation and contains invalid values (e.g., `7` which is out of the range `0` to `4`).

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach involves maintaining a set of available numbers (initially all numbers from `0` to `n-1`) and updating this set as we construct the permutation `p`.
   - For each `a_i`, we calculate `p_i` as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_{i-1}) - a_i` and remove `p_i` from the set of available numbers.
   - The corrected version of the program ensures that `res` is a valid permutation and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a` as per the problem description. The original assessment is accurate, and the program needs to be corrected as outlined in the assessment.
