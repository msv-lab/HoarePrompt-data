### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify whether the program correctly constructs a permutation `p` that satisfies the condition `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]` for each element in the array `a`.

The provided solution works as follows:
1. For each test case, it initializes an array `res` of size `n` with `None` values.
2. It starts with `mex` set to `n`.
3. It iterates through the array `a` from the end to the beginning.
4. For each element `ar[i]` in `a`, it calculates `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`.
5. If the calculated `res[i]` is less than the current `mex`, it updates `mex` to `res[i]`.
6. Finally, it prints the constructed permutation `res`.

We need to verify if this approach correctly constructs the permutation `p`:
- The `mex` variable is used to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer that has not yet been used in the permutation `p`.
- By iterating from the end of the array `a` to the beginning, the program ensures that the `mex` value is correctly updated based on the elements that have not yet been placed in the permutation.
- The condition `mex > mex - ar[i]` ensures that the `mex` is only updated when a smaller value is found, which is important for maintaining the `mex` property.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program appears to correctly construct a valid permutation `p` for each test case. The execution summary also supports this, as it describes the process accurately.
