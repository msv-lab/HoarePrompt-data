### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program against the problem description and the function summaries.

1. **Handling of Odd `k` Values**:
   - The program checks if `k` is odd and immediately returns `(0, 0)` if it is. This is incorrect because the Manhattan value can indeed be odd for certain permutations. For example, for `n=2`, the permutation `[2, 1]` has a Manhattan value of `|2-1| + |1-2| = 1`, which is odd.
   - **Conclusion**: The program incorrectly handles odd `k` values by returning `(0, 0)`.

2. **Maximum `k` Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` as `(n^2 - 1) // 2` for odd `n` and `n^2 // 2` for even `n`. This is incorrect.
   - The correct maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This is because the maximum deviation for each element `p_i` from its position `i` is `n - 1`, and there are `n` elements, but the sum of deviations is maximized when each element is placed at the opposite end, leading to a sum of `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - **Conclusion**: The program incorrectly calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value.

3. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` for constructing the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value `k` is not robust and may not cover all cases. The approach seems to be based on swapping elements to increase the Manhattan value, but it does not guarantee that it can achieve every possible `k` value.
   - **Conclusion**: The permutation construction logic is flawed and may not generate correct permutations for all valid `k` values.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the case `n=2` and `k=1`. The correct output should be:
```
YES
2 1
```
However, the program will return `NO` because it incorrectly handles odd `k` values.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issues identified in handling odd `k` values, maximum `k` calculation, and permutation construction, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.

**Final: False**
