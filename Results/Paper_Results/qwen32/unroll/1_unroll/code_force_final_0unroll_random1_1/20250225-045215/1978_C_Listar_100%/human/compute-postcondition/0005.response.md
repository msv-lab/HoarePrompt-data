The code assigns the result of the function `func_1(n, k)` to the variable `l`. The values of `n` and `k` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `l` and retains the original values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`. `n` is not equal to 0; `l` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`**.
