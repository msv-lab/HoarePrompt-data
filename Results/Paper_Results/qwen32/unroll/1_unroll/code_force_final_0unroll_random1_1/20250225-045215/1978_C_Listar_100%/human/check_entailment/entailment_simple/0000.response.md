To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value equal to `k` or correctly identifies when no such permutation exists. Let's break down the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It calls `func_6()` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_4()`**:
   - This function checks if `k` is even. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no valid permutation exists.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` for the given `n`.
   - If `k` is greater than `max_k`, it also returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

3. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - This function generates a permutation with the given `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes a list `l` with values from `1` to `n`.
   - It iterates over the list in reverse, adjusting `k` and the list `l` to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - It calls `func_2()` and `func_3()` to swap elements in the list to increase the Manhattan value.
   - It returns the adjusted list `l`.

4. **Function `func_2(c, k, l)`**:
   - This function swaps two elements in the list `l` to increase the Manhattan value by `k`.
   - It swaps the elements at positions `-c` and `-c-k` in the list `l`.

5. **Function `func_3(c, l)`**:
   - This function swaps the elements at positions `c-1` and `-c` in the list `l`.
   - It is used to adjust the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

6. **Function `func_5(l)`**:
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation `l` if a valid permutation is found.
   - If no valid permutation is found, `func_6()` prints "NO".

### Analysis

- **Even Check for `k`**: The program correctly checks if `k` is even. If `k` is odd, it returns "NO" because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
- **Maximum Manhattan Value Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` correctly. For an odd `n`, `max_k = (n^2 - 1) / 2`, and for an even `n`, `max_k = n^2 / 2`. This ensures that the program correctly identifies when `k` is too large to be achievable.
- **Permutation Construction**: The program uses a strategy to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value by swapping elements. This strategy is based on the observation that swapping elements can increase the Manhattan value by a specific amount. The detailed logic of `func_1()`, `func_2()`, and `func_3()` ensures that the Manhattan value is adjusted correctly.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles the input, checks the feasibility of the problem, and constructs a valid permutation when possible. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
