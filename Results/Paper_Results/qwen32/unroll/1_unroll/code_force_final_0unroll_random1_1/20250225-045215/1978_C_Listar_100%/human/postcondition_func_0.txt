The function accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 200,000) and `k` (a non-negative integer between 0 and 1 trillion). It returns a list `l` which is initially a range from 1 to `n`. The function modifies this list based on the value of `k` and returns it. If `k` is reduced to zero during the process, the current state of the list `l` is returned. If `k` is less than `i - 1` at any point, the function calls `func_2` with the current count `c`, the remaining `k`, and the list `l`. The list `l` is also modified by calling `func_3` with the count `c` in each iteration of the loop. The final state of the program is the returned list `l` after all modifications.
