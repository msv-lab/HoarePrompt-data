The given code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings using the `split()` method. This means that `data` will be a list of string values that were separated by whitespace in the input.

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. The array `a` contains `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

After executing the code snippet `data = input().split()`, `data` will be a list of strings that were provided in the input. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and the elements of `a` and the queries are not directly modified by this line, but they will be represented as strings within the `data` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. The array `a` contains `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `data` is a list of strings representing the input values split by whitespace.**
