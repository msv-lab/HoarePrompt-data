To determine what will be printed by the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the contents of the `results` list.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` remains unchanged and represents the number of test cases.
- `n` and `q` are the last values read from `data` during the last iteration, where `n` is likely the number of elements in an array and `q` is the number of queries.
- `a` and `pf` are arrays computed during the last iteration. `a` might be the original array of integers, and `pf` could be a prefix sum array.
- `mp` is a dictionary computed during the last iteration, potentially storing some mappings or counts.
- `idx` is the index after processing all test cases.
- `results` contains the results of all queries for all test cases, with each test case's results followed by an empty string.

### Understanding the `results` List:
The `results` list accumulates the results of each query for each test case. Each test case's results are stored sequentially, and an empty string is appended after each test case's results to separate them.

### Output Explanation:
When the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement is executed, it will join all elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). This means:
- Each result of a query will be on a new line.
- An empty string in the `results` list will result in an additional newline, effectively separating the results of different test cases.

### Final Output:
Given that `results` contains the results of all queries for all test cases, each followed by an empty string, the output will be a series of query results separated by newlines, with an additional newline separating the results of different test cases.

Output: **query_result_1\nquery_result_2\n...\n\nquery_result_x\nquery_result_y\n...\n (where each query_result is the result of a query and newlines separate the results of different queries and test cases)**

This description captures the precise output based on the given initial state.
