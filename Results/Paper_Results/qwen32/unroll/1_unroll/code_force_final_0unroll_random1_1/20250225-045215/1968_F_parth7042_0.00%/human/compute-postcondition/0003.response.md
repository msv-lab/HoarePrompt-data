Initial State: `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`; `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5; the array `a` contains `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30; each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `data` is a list of strings representing the input values split by whitespace; `idx` is 0.

The code snippet provided is:
```
idx += 1
```

Impact: The variable `idx` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `data`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`; `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5; the array `a` contains `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30; each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `data` is a list of strings representing the input values split by whitespace; `idx` is 1.**
