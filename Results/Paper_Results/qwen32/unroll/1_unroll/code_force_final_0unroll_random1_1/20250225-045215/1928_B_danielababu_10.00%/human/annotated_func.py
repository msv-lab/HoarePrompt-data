#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer that is input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and returns an integer that is input by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_2` does not take any parameters and returns a map object which is an iterator of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each split string to an integer.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object which is an iterator of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each split string to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes no input parameters and returns a map object, which is an iterator of integers. This iterator is created by splitting an input string into substrings and converting each substring into an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_3`. This function does not take any parameters and is expected to read input from standard input, split it into a list of integers, and return this list.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were obtained by reading input from standard input, splitting this input into parts, and converting each part into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into parts based on whitespace, converts each part into an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_4`.
def func_4():
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers that were input by the user as a space-separated string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` prompts the user to input a space-separated string of integers, converts this string into a list of integers, sorts the list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_5`. The function does not take any parameters and does not contribute directly to the logic described in the problem statement based on the given code snippet.
def func_5():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing string representations of the elements obtained by splitting the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` takes no input parameters and returns a map object that contains the string representations of the elements obtained by splitting an input string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters in its signature, so no precondition can be specified based on the variables in the function signature.
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters that were input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of characters that were input by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_7` does not take any parameters.
def func_7():
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of strings, where each string is a substring from the input, split by whitespace and sorted in lexicographical order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` takes no input parameters and returns a sorted list of strings. These strings are derived from the user's input, which is split into substrings by whitespace and then sorted in lexicographical order.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_8(arr):

    return ans
    #The program returns ans which is [2, 6, 24]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list where each element is the cumulative product of the elements from the input list up to that index.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_9(arr):

    #State: arr is a list of integers; ans is a list of cumulative products of arr in reverse order; tem is the product of all elements in arr.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is a list of cumulative products of `arr` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list where each element is the cumulative product of the elements from the original list up to that point, but in reverse order.
