The given program does not contain the actual solution to the problem. The provided functions (`func_1` to `func_9`) are utility functions for handling input and performing some basic operations like computing prefix and suffix products, but they do not address the core problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding a permutation.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the problem and the correct approach:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to add a permutation of numbers from 1 to n to the array `a` to maximize the frequency of any single number in the resulting array.

2. **Key Insight**: The optimal strategy involves aligning the smallest values in the array with the largest values in the permutation to create the highest possible frequency of a single number.

3. **Approach**:
   - Sort the array `a`.
   - Consider the effect of adding a permutation to `a`. The permutation will be [1, 2, 3, ..., n].
   - The resulting array will be `a[i] + i + 1` for each element `a[i]` in the sorted array.
   - Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each resulting number.
   - The answer will be the maximum frequency found.

4. **Implementation**: The provided code does not implement this approach. Instead, it includes utility functions that are not relevant to solving the problem.

Given that the provided code does not contain a solution to the problem, the correctness of the program in the context of solving the problem is **False**.

**Correctness: False**
