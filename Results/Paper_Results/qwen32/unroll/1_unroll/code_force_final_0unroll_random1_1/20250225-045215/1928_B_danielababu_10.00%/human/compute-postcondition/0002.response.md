To determine the state needed for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variable `i` and the expression `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)`.

Here's the breakdown:

- The loop will iterate over the indices of `arr` in reverse order, starting from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `arr` must have at least one element. If `arr` is empty, the range will be `range(-1, -1, -1)`, which is empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given this, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `arr` has at least one element. The variables `ans` and `tem` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `arr` has at least one element.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `ans` is an empty list; `tem` is 1**
