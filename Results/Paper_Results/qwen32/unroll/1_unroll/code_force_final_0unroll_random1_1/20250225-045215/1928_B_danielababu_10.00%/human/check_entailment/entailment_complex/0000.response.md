### Reasoning:

The given Python program is intended to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding a permutation to the array.

Here is a breakdown of the logic and how it aligns with the problem statement:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `func_1()` is used to read the number of test cases and the size of the array `n` for each test case.
   - `func_3()` is used to read the elements of the array `a` for each test case.

2. **Processing:**
   - The maximum element `m` in the array `a` is found.
   - A new list `new` is created where each element is `m - a[i] + 1`. This transformation is intended to map the values of the array such that the smallest element in the original array maps to `1`, the second smallest to `2`, and so on.
   - The list `new` is then sorted.
   - A set `ans` is used to store unique values from `new` that are within the range `[1, n]`.

3. **Output:**
   - The length of the set `ans` is printed, which represents the maximum number of elements that can be made equal after adding a permutation to the array.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Transformation Logic:**
  - The transformation `m - a[i] + 1` is used to map the values of the array `a` to a new range `[1, n]`. This mapping is crucial because it ensures that the smallest element in the original array maps to `1`, the second smallest to `2`, and so on.
  - By sorting the new list and checking which values fall within `[1, n]`, we can determine the maximum number of elements that can be made equal after adding a permutation.

- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The approach is correct in the sense that it uses the properties of permutations to map the values of the array to a range `[1, n]`.
  - By ensuring that the values are within `[1, n]`, we are effectively checking if we can make a certain number of elements equal by adding a permutation.
  - The use of a set to store unique values ensures that we count the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The transformation and the subsequent steps are logically consistent with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
