You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Vasya has two hobbies — adding permutations^{\dagger} to arrays and finding
the most frequently occurring element. Recently, he found an array a and
decided to find out the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in
the array a that he can obtain after adding some permutation to the array a .

More formally, Vasya must choose exactly one permutation p_1, p_2, p_3,
\ldots, p_n of length n , and then change the elements of the array a
according to the rule a_i := a_i + p_i . After that, Vasya counts how many
times each number occurs in the array a and takes the maximum of these values.
You need to determine the maximum value he can obtain.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then
follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum number of elements
equal to the same number after the operation of adding a permutation.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to choose p = [2, 1] . Then after
applying the operation, the array a will be [3, 3] , in which the number 3
occurs twice, so the answer is 2 .

In the second test case, one of the optimal options is p = [2, 3, 1, 4] .
After applying the operation, the array a will be [9, 4, 5, 5] . Since the
number 5 occurs twice, the answer is 2 .
Program:
```
def func_9(arr):
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        tem *= arr[i]
        ans.append(tem)
    return ans
```
