You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities, `n`, their coordinates `l`, the number of queries, `m`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The program uses two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the minimum number of coins needed to travel from the first city to any other city and from the last city to any other city, respectively.
   - `d1` is used to store the cost to reach city `i` from city `1` using the closest city rule.
   - `d2` is used to store the cost to reach city `i` from city `n` using the closest city rule.

3. **Populating `d1`:**
   - The program initializes `d1[2] = 1` because the closest city to the first city is always the second city, and it costs 1 coin to travel to it.
   - It then iterates from the second city to the second last city. For each city `i`, it checks whether the next city `i+1` or the previous city `i-1` is closer. If `i+1` is closer, it adds 1 coin to the cost from `i+1`. Otherwise, it adds the distance to `i+1` to the cost from `i+1`.

4. **Populating `d2`:**
   - The program initializes `d2[n-1] = 1` because the closest city to the last city is always the second last city, and it costs 1 coin to travel to it.
   - It then iterates from the second last city to the first city. For each city `i`, it checks whether the previous city `i-1` or the next city `i+1` is closer. If `i-1` is closer, it adds 1 coin to the cost from `i+1`. Otherwise, it adds the distance to `i-1` to the cost from `i+1`.

5. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query `(x, y)`, it checks if `y > x`. If true, it calculates the cost as `d1[y] - d1[x]`. Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `d2[y] - d2[x]`.

### Issues:
- The logic for populating `d1` and `d2` is incorrect. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to travel between cities using the closest city rule.
- The program incorrectly assumes that `d1` and `d2` can be calculated in a linear fashion, which is not the case. The closest city rule requires a more nuanced approach, possibly involving dynamic programming or a different strategy to ensure that the closest city is always chosen optimally.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the logic for calculating the minimum cost to travel between cities using the closest city rule, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
