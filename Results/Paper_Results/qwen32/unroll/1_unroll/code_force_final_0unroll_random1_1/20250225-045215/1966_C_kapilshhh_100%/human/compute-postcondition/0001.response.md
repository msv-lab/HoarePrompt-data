To ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the state of the variable `tc` so that it is greater than 0. The other variables mentioned (`number of piles` and `number of stones in each pile`) are not part of the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Given the loop condition `while tc > 0:`, the loop will execute if `tc` is greater than 0. Since `tc` is described as "an integer representing the number of test cases, which is the input value," we need to ensure that this input value is greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state should specify that `tc` must be greater than 0.

State: **`tc` must be greater than 0**
