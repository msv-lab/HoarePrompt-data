Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of distinct integers and two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of elements that can be moved to the beginning of the list under specific conditions related to the value at index `k-1`. The function outputs a series of integers, each representing the result for a corresponding test case.**
