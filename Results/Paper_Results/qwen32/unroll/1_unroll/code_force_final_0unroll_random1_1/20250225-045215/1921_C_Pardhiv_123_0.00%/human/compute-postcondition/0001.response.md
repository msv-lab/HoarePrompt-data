The `while` loop statement in the given task is `while t > 0:`. This means the loop will execute as long as the variable `t` is greater than 0.

Given the state right before the loop: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time. However, since `t` is already stated to be in the range 1 <= t <= 10^4, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `t` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
