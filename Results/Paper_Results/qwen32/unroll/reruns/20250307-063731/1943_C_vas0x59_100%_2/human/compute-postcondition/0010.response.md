To determine the output state after the loop finishes, let's analyze the loop's behavior and the variables involved:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `path_ba` starts with a single element, which is the result of `func_1(d)`. Let's denote this result as `b`.
   - The loop continues until `n` (the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`) becomes `-1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - In each iteration, the loop appends the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` to `path_ba`.
   - The loop terminates when `previous[path_ba[-1]]` equals `-1`.

3. **Meaning of `previous` List**:
   - The `previous` list keeps track of the shortest path from node `0` to each node. Specifically, `previous[i]` contains the index of the previous node on the shortest path from node `0` to node `i`.
   - If `previous[i]` is `-1`, it means that there is no previous node, typically indicating that node `i` is node `0` itself (since the shortest path from node `0` to itself does not have a previous node).

4. **Termination Condition**:
   - The loop will terminate when it reaches node `0` (since `previous[0]` is `-1`).

5. **Result**:
   - `path_ba` will contain the indices of the nodes on the shortest path from node `0` to node `b` in reverse order (i.e., from `b` to `0`).

Given these points, the output state after the loop completes will be:

- `path_ba` will contain the indices of the nodes on the shortest path from node `0` to node `b`, starting from `b` and ending at `0`.

**Output State: **`path_ba` contains the indices of the nodes on the shortest path from node `0` to node `b` in reverse order.**

In natural language, this means that `path_ba` will be a list of node indices representing the shortest path from node `0` to node `b`, but listed in reverse order, starting from node `b` and ending at node `0`.
