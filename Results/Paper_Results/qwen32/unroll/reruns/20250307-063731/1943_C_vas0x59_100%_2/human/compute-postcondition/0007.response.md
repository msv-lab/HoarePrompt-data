To determine the Output State, we need to understand the impact of the code `b = func_1(d)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we can assume that `func_1` takes the list `d` as input and returns some value or modifies it in some way. However, without the definition of `func_1`, we can only assume that `b` will hold the return value of `func_1(d)`.

Given the initial state, the only change we can confidently state is that `b` will be assigned the value returned by `func_1(d)`. The other variables `u2vs`, `d`, and `previous` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the indices of all nodes directly connected to node `i` in the graph; `d` is a list of shortest path distances from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph; `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the index of the previous node in the shortest path to node `i` from node `0`; `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`**.
