Let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state:

1. **path_ba**: This is a list containing the indices of nodes on the shortest path from node 0 to node b in reverse order.
2. **ops**: This list is defined based on the length of `path_ba`:
    - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list of tuples `[(c, 0), (c, 1), ..., (c, ci)]`, where `c` is the value at the middle index (`path_ba[len(path_ba) // 2]`) and `ci` is the middle index.
    - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3)]`, where `ci1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1` and `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`. `c1` is the value at index `ci1` and `c2` is the value at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.

3. **print statement**: The print statement uses the `map` function to format each tuple in `ops` as a string and then prints them, each on a new line.

### Case 1: Length of `path_ba` is odd
- Let's assume `path_ba` has an odd length, say `2n + 1`.
- The middle index is `n`.
- `ops` will be `[(path_ba[n], 0), (path_ba[n], 1), ..., (path_ba[n], n)]`.
- Each tuple `(path_ba[n], i)` is formatted as `f'{path_ba[n] + 1} {i}'`.

### Case 2: Length of `path_ba` is even
- Let's assume `path_ba` has an even length, say `2n`.
- The middle indices are `n-1` and `n`.
- `ops` will be `[(path_ba[n-1], 1), (path_ba[n], 1), (path_ba[n-1], 3), (path_ba[n], 3)]`.
- Each tuple `(path_ba[i], j)` is formatted as `f'{path_ba[i] + 1} {j}'`.

### General Output Description
- For each tuple `(x, y)` in `ops`, the print statement outputs `x + 1` followed by `y`, separated by a space.
- Each line corresponds to one tuple in `ops`.

### Final Output
Based on the description above, the output will be a series of lines where each line contains a node index (from `path_ba`) incremented by 1, followed by a specific operation code (0, 1, 3).

Given the structure of `ops`, the output will be:
- If `path_ba` has an odd length, it will print `path_ba[n] + 1` followed by 0, 1, ..., n on separate lines.
- If `path_ba` has an even length, it will print `path_ba[n-1] + 1` followed by 1, `path_ba[n] + 1` followed by 1, `path_ba[n-1] + 1` followed by 3, and `path_ba[n] + 1` followed by 3, each on separate lines.

Since the exact `path_ba` list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated values.

Output: **Each line will be in the format `x+1 y` where `x` is the node index from `path_ba` and `y` is the operation code (0, 1, or 3) based on the length and middle indices of `path_ba`.**
