Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree (where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3), and `u2vs`, a list of lists where `u2vs[i]` contains the list of vertices directly connected to vertex `i` (0-indexed), representing the adjacency list of the tree. The function returns `None`.**
