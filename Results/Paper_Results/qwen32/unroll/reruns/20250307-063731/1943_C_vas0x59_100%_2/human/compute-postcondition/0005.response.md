To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1` does with the input `d`. Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we'll assume that `func_1` processes the list `d` and returns some value or modifies it in a certain way. Without the specific implementation of `func_1`, we can only infer that `a` will be assigned the result of `func_1(d)`.

However, we can still provide a general output state based on the given information.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the indices of all nodes directly connected to node `i` in the graph; `d` is a list of distances from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.

In natural language: The list `u2vs` remains unchanged, containing the indices of all nodes directly connected to each node in the graph. The list `d` also remains unchanged, containing the distances from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph. The variable `a` is assigned the result of the function `func_1` when called with `d` as its argument.
