In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop. This means that the loop will always execute at least once, regardless of the state of the program variables. Therefore, no modification to the program state is necessary to ensure that the loop can proceed to its first iteration.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the indices of all nodes directly connected to node `i` in the graph; `d` is a list of shortest path distances from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph; `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the index of the previous node in the shortest path to node `i` from node `0`; `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.**
