The code assigns the value at index `ci2` in `path_ba` to the variable `c2`. None of the other variables are modified by this assignment.

Output State: **`path_ba` contains the indices of the nodes on the shortest path from node `0` to node `b` in reverse order; `ops` is an empty list; `ci2` is the integer value of half the length of `path_ba`; `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`; `c1` is the value at index `ci1` in `path_ba`; `c2` is the value at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.**
