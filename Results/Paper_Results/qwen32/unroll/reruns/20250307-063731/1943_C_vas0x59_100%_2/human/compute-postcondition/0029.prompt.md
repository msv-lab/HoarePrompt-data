You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3. u2vs is a list of lists where u2vs[i] contains the list of vertices directly connected to vertex i (0-indexed), representing the adjacency list of the tree.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the indices of all nodes directly connected to node `i` in the graph.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: `path_ba` contains the indices of the nodes on the shortest path from node `0` to node `b` in reverse order.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: - The `ops` list will contain tuples where the first element is always `c` (the value at the middle index of `path_ba`), and the second element ranges from `0` to `ci`.
        #   - The length of `ops` will be `ci + 1`.
        #
        #Given the above, the output state will be:
        #
        #- `path_ba` remains unchanged.
        #- `ci` remains unchanged.
        #- `c` remains unchanged.
        #- `ops` will be a list of tuples `[(c, 0), (c, 1), ..., (c, ci)]`.
        #
        #Output State:
    else :
        ci2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        ci1 = ci2 - 1
        c1 = path_ba[ci1]
        c2 = path_ba[ci2]
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: path_ba contains the indices of the nodes on the shortest path from node 0 to node b in reverse order; ops is [(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3)]; ci2 is the integer value of half the length of path_ba; ci1 is ci2 - 1; c1 is the value at index ci1 in path_ba; c2 is the value at index ci2 in path_ba.
    #State: `path_ba` contains the indices of the nodes on the shortest path from node 0 to node b in reverse order. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` will be a list of tuples `[(c, 0), (c, 1), ..., (c, ci)]`, where `c` is the value at the middle index of `path_ba` and `ci` is the middle index. Otherwise, `ops` will be `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3)]`, where `ci1` is the integer value of half the length of `path_ba` minus one, `ci2` is the integer value of half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is the value at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, and `c2` is the value at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: len(ops) (where len(ops) is (len(path_ba) // 2) + 1 if len(path_ba) is odd, or 4 if len(path_ba) is even)
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: Each line will be in the format `x+1 y` where `x` is the node index from `path_ba` and `y` is the operation code (0, 1, or 3) based on the length and middle indices of `path_ba`.
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree (where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3), and `u2vs`, a list of lists where `u2vs[i]` contains the list of vertices directly connected to vertex `i` (0-indexed), representing the adjacency list of the tree. The function returns `None`.

Return Postconditions: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
