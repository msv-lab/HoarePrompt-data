The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree and an adjacency list `u2vs` representing the tree's edges. It calculates the longest path in the tree and generates a series of operations based on the middle node(s) of this path. The function prints the number of operations and the operations themselves, where each operation is a tuple indicating a node index and an operation code. The function returns `None`.
