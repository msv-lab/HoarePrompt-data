The code snippet calculates the middle index of the list `path_ba` by performing integer division of its length by 2. Since the length of `path_ba` is odd, the middle index will be an integer value.

Given that `path_ba` has an odd length, let's denote its length as `2k + 1` for some integer `k`. The middle index `ci` will then be `(2k + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `k`.

The variable `ops` remains unchanged as it is an empty list and no operations are performed on it.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`path_ba` contains the indices of the nodes on the shortest path from node `0` to node `b` in reverse order, and the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ops` is an empty list; `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, calculated as `len(path_ba) // 2`.**
