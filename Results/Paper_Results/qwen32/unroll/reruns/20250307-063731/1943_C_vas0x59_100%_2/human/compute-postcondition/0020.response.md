The code snippet `c1 = path_ba[ci1]` assigns the value at index `ci1` of the list `path_ba` to the variable `c1`. The value of `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, where `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`. Therefore, `c1` will hold the value of the element at the index `ci2 - 1` in `path_ba`.

Since the values of `path_ba`, `ci2`, and `ci1` are given in the initial state and are not modified by the code snippet, the output state will reflect the assignment of `c1` without altering the other variables.

Output State: **`path_ba` contains the indices of the nodes on the shortest path from node `0` to node `b` in reverse order; `ops` is an empty list; `ci2` is the integer value of half the length of `path_ba`; `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`; `c1` is the value at index `ci1` in `path_ba`.**
