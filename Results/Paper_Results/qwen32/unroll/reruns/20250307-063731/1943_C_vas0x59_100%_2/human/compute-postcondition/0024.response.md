Postcondition: **`path_ba` contains the indices of the nodes on the shortest path from node 0 to node b in reverse order. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` will be a list of tuples `[(c, 0), (c, 1), ..., (c, ci)]`, where `c` is the value at the middle index of `path_ba` and `ci` is the middle index. Otherwise, `ops` will be `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3)]`, where `ci1` is the integer value of half the length of `path_ba` minus one, `ci2` is the integer value of half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is the value at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, and `c2` is the value at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.**
