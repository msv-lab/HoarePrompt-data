Output State: **`path_ba` contains the indices of the nodes on the shortest path from node `0` to node `b` in reverse order; `ops` is an empty list; `ci2` is the integer value of half the length of `path_ba`; `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`.**

In natural language: The variable `ci1` is now assigned the value of `ci2 - 1`. All other variables retain their initial states.
