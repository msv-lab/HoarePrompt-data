To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ops))` statement, we need to analyze the conditions given in the initial state and how they affect the `ops` list.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Length of `path_ba`**:
   - `path_ba` is a list containing indices of nodes on the shortest path from node 0 to node b in reverse order.
   - The length of `path_ba` can be either odd or even.

2. **Determination of `ops`**:
   - If the length of `path_ba` is **odd**:
     - `ops` will be a list of tuples `[(c, 0), (c, 1), ..., (c, ci)]`, where:
       - `c` is the value at the middle index of `path_ba`.
       - `ci` is the middle index.
     - The length of `ops` will be `ci + 1`, which is `(len(path_ba) // 2) + 1`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is **even**:
     - `ops` will be `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3)]`, where:
       - `ci1` is the integer value of half the length of `path_ba` minus one (`len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`).
       - `ci2` is the integer value of half the length of `path_ba` (`len(path_ba) // 2`).
       - `c1` is the value at index `ci1` in `path_ba`.
       - `c2` is the value at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.
     - The length of `ops` will be 4.

### Conclusion:
- The length of `ops` depends on whether the length of `path_ba` is odd or even.
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `len(ops)` will be `(len(path_ba) // 2) + 1`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even, `len(ops)` will be 4.

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not specified, we can only describe the length of `ops` in terms of the length of `path_ba`.

### Final Output:
Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is (len(path_ba) // 2) + 1 if len(path_ba) is odd, or 4 if len(path_ba) is even)**
