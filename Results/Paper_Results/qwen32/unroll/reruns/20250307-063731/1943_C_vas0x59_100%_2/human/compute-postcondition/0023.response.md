To determine the output state, let's first understand the initial state and the loop's operation.

### Initial State:
- `path_ba`: Contains the indices of the nodes on the shortest path from node `0` to node `b` in reverse order.
- `ops`: An empty list.
- `ci2`: Integer value of half the length of `path_ba`.
- `ci1`: `ci2 - 1`.
- `c1`: Value at index `ci1` in `path_ba`.
- `c2`: Value at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates from `1` to `len(path_ba) - ci1` with a step of `2`. In each iteration, it appends a tuple `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` to the `ops` list.

### Output State Calculation:
1. **Initial Values**: 
   - `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
   - `ci1` is one less than `ci2`.
   - `c1` is the value at index `ci1` in `path_ba`.
   - `c2` is the value at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over the indices from `1` to `len(path_ba) - ci1` with a step of `2`. 
   - For each iteration `i`, it appends `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` to `ops`.

### Final Output State:
- `path_ba`: Remains unchanged.
- `ops`: Contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each iteration `i`.
- `ci2`, `ci1`, `c1`, and `c2`: Remain unchanged.

### Example:
Suppose `path_ba` is `[5, 3, 2, 1, 0]` (path from node `0` to node `5` in reverse order).

- `len(path_ba) = 5`
- `ci2 = 5 // 2 = 2`
- `ci1 = 2 - 1 = 1`
- `c1 = path_ba[1] = 3`
- `c2 = path_ba[2] = 2`

The loop runs from `1` to `5 - 1 = 4` with a step of `2`:
- For `i = 1`: `ops` becomes `[(3, 1), (2, 1)]`
- For `i = 3`: `ops` becomes `[(3, 1), (2, 1), (3, 3), (2, 3)]`

### Output State:
Output State: **path_ba contains the indices of the nodes on the shortest path from node 0 to node b in reverse order; ops is [(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3)]; ci2 is the integer value of half the length of path_ba; ci1 is ci2 - 1; c1 is the value at index ci1 in path_ba; c2 is the value at index ci2 in path_ba.**
