Given the initial state and the code snippet, the variable `n` is reassigned to the integer value provided by the input function. The variable `u2vs` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value provided by the input, `u2vs` is a list of lists where `u2vs[i]` contains the list of vertices directly connected to vertex `i` (0-indexed), representing the adjacency list of the tree.**
