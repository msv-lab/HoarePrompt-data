To determine the output state after the loop finishes, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop runs `n-1` times, and in each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `u` and `v`, decrements both by 1, and appends `v` to the list at index `u` in `u2vs` and `u` to the list at index `v` in `u2vs`. This essentially builds an adjacency list representation of an undirected graph with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges.

Given the initial state where `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, after the loop, `u2vs` will contain the adjacency lists for each node in the graph.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the indices of all nodes directly connected to node `i` in the graph.**
