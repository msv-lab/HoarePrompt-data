Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the indices of all nodes directly connected to node `i` in the graph; `d` is a list of shortest path distances from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph; `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the index of the previous node in the shortest path to node `i` from node `0`; `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
