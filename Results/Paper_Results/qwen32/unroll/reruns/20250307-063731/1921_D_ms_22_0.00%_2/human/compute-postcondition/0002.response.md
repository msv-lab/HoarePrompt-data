The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Since `t` is within this range, it already satisfies the condition `t > 0` for the loop to execute.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100**
