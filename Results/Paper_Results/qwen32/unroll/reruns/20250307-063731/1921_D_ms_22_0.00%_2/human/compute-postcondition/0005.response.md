The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m` where `n` is the length of list `a` and `m` is the length of list `b`. It also accepts two lists: `a` which contains `n` integers and `b` which contains `m` integers. The function returns the result for each test case based on the provided lists `a` and `b`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It returns the result for each test case based on the provided lists `a` and `b`.**
