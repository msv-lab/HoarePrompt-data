Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` which represents the minimum sum of absolute differences between elements of `a` and selected elements of `b`, following a specific pairing strategy.**
