Postcondition: **`tree` is a defaultdict with lists as the default factory, `n` is unchanged, `edges` is unchanged, `start` is unchanged, `leaves` is a list of nodes that have exactly one connection in the tree, `dist1` is the shortest path distance from `start` to `leaves[0]`, `dist2` is the shortest path distance from `start` to `leaves[1]`, and both `dist1` and `dist2` are even numbers.**
