Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (an integer representing the node where the stone is initially placed). The function determines the outcome of a game played on the tree and returns 'Ron' if Ron wins, and 'Hermione' if Hermione wins.**
