The code snippet initializes a `queue` with a tuple containing the `start` node and the distance `0`. This means that the queue now contains the starting node of the tree and the initial distance from the start node to itself, which is 0. The values of `start`, `target`, and `tree` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n. `tree` is an adjacency list representing the tree structure with n nodes. `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`.**
