The function `func_1` determines the winner of a game played on a tree structure. It takes three parameters: the number of nodes `n`, a list of edges `edges`, and the starting node `start`. The function returns 'Ron' if Ron wins and 'Hermione' if Hermione wins, based on the distances from the starting node to two leaf nodes.
