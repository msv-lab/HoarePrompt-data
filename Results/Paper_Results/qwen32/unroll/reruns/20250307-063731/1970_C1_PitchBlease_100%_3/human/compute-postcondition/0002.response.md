In the provided `while` loop, the loop will continue as long as `queue` is not empty. The state right before the loop includes the following:

- `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n.
- `tree` is an adjacency list representing the tree structure with n nodes.
- `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`.
- `visited` is a set containing the `start` node.

Given the loop condition `while queue:`, the loop will definitely execute at least once because `queue` is initialized with the tuple `(start, 0)`, making it non-empty.

Since the loop can certainly execute one time, we do not need to modify any of the states. We simply repeat the program state right before the loop.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is an adjacency list representing the tree structure with n nodes; `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`; `visited` is a set containing the `start` node.**
