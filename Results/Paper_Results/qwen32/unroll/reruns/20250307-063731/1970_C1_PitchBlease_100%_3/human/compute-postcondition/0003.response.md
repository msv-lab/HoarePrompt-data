The provided code snippet is a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm used to find the shortest distance between a `start` node and a `target` node in an undirected tree represented by an adjacency list `tree`. The BFS algorithm uses a queue to explore nodes level by level, starting from the `start` node, and a set `visited` to keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.

Let's break down the execution process:

1. **Initialization**: The `queue` is initialized with the tuple `(start, 0)`, indicating that the `start` node is at distance 0 from itself. The `visited` set is initialized with the `start` node to prevent revisiting it.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as the `queue` is not empty.
   - In each iteration, the node at the front of the `queue` is dequeued. This node is referred to as `current`, and its distance from the `start` node is referred to as `dist`.
   - If `current` is the `target` node, the function returns `dist`, which is the shortest distance from `start` to `target`.
   - If `current` is not the `target`, the algorithm iterates over all its neighbors.
     - For each neighbor that has not been visited yet, it is added to the `visited` set, and a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is appended to the `queue`, indicating that the neighbor is at a distance of `dist + 1` from the `start` node.

3. **Termination**: The loop terminates when the `queue` is empty, which means all reachable nodes have been explored.

**Output State**:
- If the `target` node is reachable from the `start` node, the function returns the shortest distance from `start` to `target`.
- If the `target` node is not reachable (which is not possible in a connected tree), the loop would exhaust all nodes without finding the `target`, and the function would not return a value (though in a complete implementation, you might handle this case by returning a special value like `-1`).

Since the problem specifies that the tree is a connected graph, the `target` node is always reachable from the `start` node.

Output State: **the shortest distance from `start` to `target`.**

In natural language, the output state is the shortest distance between the `start` node and the `target` node in the tree, as calculated by the breadth-first search algorithm.
