To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to carefully analyze the loop and understand how the variables `i` and `ans` change with each iteration.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `ans` is initialized to 0.

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as both `i <= m` and `i * i <= n + i` hold true.

### Loop Body:
- `ans` is incremented by the integer division `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `i` exceeds `m` or `i * i` exceeds `n + i`.
   
2. **Incrementing `ans`**:
   - In each iteration, `ans` is incremented by the value of `(n + i) // (i * i)`. This value is an integer, representing how many times `i * i` fits into `n + i`.

3. **Incrementing `i`**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, starting from 1.

### Output State:
After the loop terminates, the final values of `i` and `ans` will be the output state. Specifically:
- `i` will be the smallest integer greater than `m` or the smallest integer such that `i * i` is greater than `n + i`.
- `ans` will be the accumulated sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all valid iterations.

### Output State Format:
Given the above analysis, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`i` is the smallest integer such that `i > m` or `i * i > n + i`, and `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 up to the final value of `i` minus 1.**

In simpler terms:
- `i` will be the value that causes the loop to stop.
- `ans` will be the total sum calculated during the loop's execution.
