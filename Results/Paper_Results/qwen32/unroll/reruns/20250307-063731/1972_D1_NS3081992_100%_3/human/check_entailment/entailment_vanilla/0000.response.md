To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze whether the function `func_16()` correctly solves the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
     - `1 ≤ a ≤ n`
     - `1 ≤ b ≤ m`
     - `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
     - `a + b = k * b * gcd(a, b)` for some integer `k`
     - Simplifying, we get `a = k * b * gcd(a, b) - b`
     - This implies `a = b * (k * gcd(a, b) - 1)`

3. **Simplifying Further**:
   - For `a` to be an integer, `k * gcd(a, b) - 1` must be an integer.
   - This means `a` must be of the form `b * t` where `t` is an integer.
   - Therefore, `gcd(a, b) = gcd(b * t, b) = b * gcd(t, 1) = b` if `t` is coprime with `b`.

4. **Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - For each `b` from `1` to `m`, we need to count valid `a` values.
   - `a` can be `b, 2b, 3b, ..., (n//b)*b` as long as `a + b` is a multiple of `b^2`.
   - This simplifies to counting multiples of `b` up to `n` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b^2`.

5. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func_15()` seems to implement the logic for counting valid pairs for a given `n` and `m`.
   - The function `func_16()` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15()` for each test case.

6. **Function `func_15()` Analysis**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of `i` (which seems to represent `b` in the simplified form).
   - It calculates the number of valid `a` values for each `i` and sums them up.
   - The condition `(n + i) // (i * i)` seems to count the number of multiples of `i` up to `n` that satisfy the condition.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_15()` appears to correctly implement the logic to count valid pairs for a given `n` and `m`.
   - The function `func_16()` correctly processes multiple test cases.

Given the above analysis, the provided program seems to correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
