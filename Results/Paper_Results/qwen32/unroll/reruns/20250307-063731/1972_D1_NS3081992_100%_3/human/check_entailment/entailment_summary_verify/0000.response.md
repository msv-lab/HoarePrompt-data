### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The primary function responsible for solving the problem is `func_15`. Here is the code for `func_15`:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:

1. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is indeed restrictive and does not cover all possible values of \(b\). This condition is too narrow and will miss many valid pairs \((a, b)\).

2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)` does not correctly address the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided formula is not derived from the problem's constraints and does not accurately count valid pairs.

3. **Off-by-One Error**:
   - The final result is adjusted by subtracting 1 (`return ans - 1`), which is incorrect and likely a mistake. This adjustment does not align with the problem's requirements.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), count the number of valid \(a\) values such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

A correct implementation would look something like this:

```python
import math

def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    ans = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    return ans
```

This approach ensures that we check all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and correctly count those that satisfy the given condition.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the provided code. The code does not correctly implement the logic to find all valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the problem's constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
