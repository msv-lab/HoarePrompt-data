Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #The program returns a list of integers that are read from standard input, split by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. The function `func_7` is not directly related to the problem description provided. However, based on the example usage, it can be inferred that `func_7` is expected to read a line of input, split it into components, convert them to integers, and return the list of these integers. This function likely serves to read input for a test case, where the input consists of two integers `n` and `m`.
def func_7():

def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
    #The program returns a list with 'rows' number of elements, where each element is the result of calling the function `func_7()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `rows` representing the number of test cases and returns a list containing `rows` number of elements, where each element is the result of calling the function `func_7()`.

#Function 9:

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts no parameters and returns an integer value provided by the user input.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature provided. The function `func_11` does not take any parameters and thus has no preconditions based on input variables.
def func_11():
    return input().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings, each string being a word from the input provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` prompts the user for input, splits the input into words, and returns a list of these words.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, processing is a list of integers, da is an integer, and rank is a list of integers.

    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for any `di` in `d[da]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` calculates a rank for a given integer `da` based on the structure of the dictionary `d` and the list `processing`. If the list associated with `da` in `d` contains only one element, it returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the minimum rank for all elements in the list `d[da]` and updates the `rank` list at index `da - 1` with this minimum rank plus one. The function ultimately returns this calculated rank.

#Function 13:

    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns (y, x - a // b * y, g)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple. If `b` is 0, it returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively computes and returns a tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)`, where `y`, `x`, and `g` are values determined by the function's logic.

#Function 14:

    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]

    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `m` is a positive integer, and `k` is an integer decreased by the sum of `m - a[i]` for all `i` such that `a[i] < m`. Additionally, `k` is less than 0.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, its length `n`, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It adjusts `k` by decreasing it with the sum of `m - a[i]` for all elements `a[i]` in `a` that are less than `m`. The function returns 1 if the adjusted `k` is non-negative; otherwise, it returns -1.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is the smallest integer such that `i > m` or `i * i > n + i`, and `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 up to the final value of `i` minus 1.
    return ans - 1
    #- The program returns `ans - 1`.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` calculates a specific sum based on the values returned from `func_7`, and returns the result minus one.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: The output consists of `k` lines, each containing the value `v`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` prints `k` lines, each containing the value `v`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
