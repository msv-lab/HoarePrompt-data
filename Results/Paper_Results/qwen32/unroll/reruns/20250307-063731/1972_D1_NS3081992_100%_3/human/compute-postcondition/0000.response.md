In this task, we need to ensure that the loop can execute by adjusting the states of the objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(func_10()):`, which means the loop will execute based on the return value of `func_10()`.

Here are the steps to determine the necessary adjustments:

1. **Identify the Objects in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the underscore `_` (which is a throwaway variable) and the function call `func_10()`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a positive integer. If `func_10()` returns 0 or a negative integer, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since we cannot directly adjust the return value of `func_10()`, we must assume that `func_10()` is a function whose return value we need to ensure is positive for the loop to execute.
   - Given the initial state, `n` and `m` are positive integers, but there is no direct relationship provided between `n`, `m`, and `func_10()`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive value.

Since we cannot modify `func_10()` directly, we assume that the function is designed to return a positive integer under the given conditions. However, to adhere strictly to the requirement of adjusting only the objects in the loop head, we can state that `func_10()` must return a positive integer.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` must return a positive integer**
