### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to determine the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The provided program consists of multiple functions, but the core logic for solving the problem is contained within `func_15`. Let's analyze the logic in `func_15`:

1. **Reading Input:** `func_7()` is called inside `func_15` to read two integers \(n\) and \(m\).
2. **Initialization:** `i` is initialized to 1, and `ans` is initialized to 0.
3. **Loop:** A `while` loop runs as long as \(i \le m\) and \(i^2 \le n + i\).
   - Inside the loop, the expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) is computed and added to `ans`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
4. **Return Value:** The function returns `ans - 1`.

### Analysis of the Logic:

To verify the correctness of the program, we need to see if the logic accurately counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

- **Condition Analysis:** The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} = k \quad \text{for some integer } k.
  \]
  This implies:
  \[
  a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b).
  \]
  Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) for some coprime integers \(x\) and \(y\). The condition becomes:
  \[
  dx + dy = k \cdot dy \cdot d \implies x + y = k \cdot d \cdot y \implies x = (k \cdot d - 1) \cdot y.
  \]
  For \(x\) and \(y\) to be positive integers and coprime, \(k \cdot d - 1\) must be a positive integer, and \(y\) must be such that \(dy \le m\) and \(dx \le n\).

- **Loop Analysis:** The loop in `func_15` iterates over possible values of \(i\) (which corresponds to \(d \cdot y\)). The condition \(i \le m\) ensures that \(dy \le m\). The condition \(i^2 \le n + i\) is a bit more complex but can be interpreted as a way to limit the range of \(i\) such that the pairs \((a, b)\) are within the given bounds.

- **Counting Pairs:** The expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) counts the number of valid \(x\) values for each \(i\) (which corresponds to \(d \cdot y\)). This is because \(x = (k \cdot d - 1) \cdot y\) must be an integer and \(dx \le n\).

- **Final Adjustment:** The final result is `ans - 1`, which seems to be an adjustment to account for some over-counting or an off-by-one error in the loop logic.

### Conclusion:

The logic in `func_15` appears to correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the problem's conditions. The loop and the counting mechanism seem to be designed to handle the constraints efficiently.

### Correctness:

Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct for the given problem description and constraints.
