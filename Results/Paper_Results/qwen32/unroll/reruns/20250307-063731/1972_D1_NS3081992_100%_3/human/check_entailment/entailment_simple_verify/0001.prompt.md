You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze whether the function `func_16()` correctly solves the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
     - `1 â‰¤ a â‰¤ n`
     - `1 â‰¤ b â‰¤ m`
     - `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
     - `a + b = k * b * gcd(a, b)` for some integer `k`
     - Simplifying, we get `a = k * b * gcd(a, b) - b`
     - This implies `a = b * (k * gcd(a, b) - 1)`

3. **Simplifying Further**:
   - For `a` to be an integer, `k * gcd(a, b) - 1` must be an integer.
   - This means `a` must be of the form `b * t` where `t` is an integer.
   - Therefore, `gcd(a, b) = gcd(b * t, b) = b * gcd(t, 1) = b` if `t` is coprime with `b`.

4. **Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - For each `b` from `1` to `m`, we need to count valid `a` values.
   - `a` can be `b, 2b, 3b, ..., (n//b)*b` as long as `a + b` is a multiple of `b^2`.
   - This simplifies to counting multiples of `b` up to `n` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b^2`.

5. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func_15()` seems to implement the logic for counting valid pairs for a given `n` and `m`.
   - The function `func_16()` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15()` for each test case.

6. **Function `func_15()` Analysis**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of `i` (which seems to represent `b` in the simplified form).
   - It calculates the number of valid `a` values for each `i` and sums them up.
   - The condition `(n + i) // (i * i)` seems to count the number of multiples of `i` up to `n` that satisfy the condition.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_15()` appears to correctly implement the logic to count valid pairs for a given `n` and `m`.
   - The function `func_16()` correctly processes multiple test cases.

Given the above analysis, the provided program seems to correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
