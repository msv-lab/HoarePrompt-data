The function `drank` is intended to process the input values for the problem, but based on the problem description, the input variables should be `n` and `m` for each test case. Therefore, the precondition for the function in the context of the problem should reflect the input constraints. The correct precondition should be: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The function parameters `d`, `processing`, `da`, and `rank` do not align with the problem description and seem to be part of the solution implementation rather than the input specification.
