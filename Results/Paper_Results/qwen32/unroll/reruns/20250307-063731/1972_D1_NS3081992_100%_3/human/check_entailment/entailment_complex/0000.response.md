### Reasoning:

The provided Python program consists of multiple functions, but the key function for solving the problem is `func_15`. According to the problem statement, the goal is to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the logic in `func_15`:

```python
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

The main loop in `func_15` iterates over values of `i` from 1 up to the point where `i * i` exceeds `n + i` and `i` is less than or equal to `m`. For each `i`, it increments `ans` by the integer division of `(n + i)` by `(i * i)`.

The function then returns `ans - 1`.

However, the logic in `func_15` does not directly implement the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided implementation seems to be an attempt to count the number of valid pairs but does not correctly apply the given mathematical condition.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check for each pair \((a, b)\) whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition for each pair, which is computationally expensive given the constraints.

Given the provided implementation, it is not clear how the loop and the formula `(n + i) // (i * i)` are supposed to satisfy the condition of the problem. Therefore, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described.
