To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program, let's systematically analyze the program code, the problem description, and the annotations provided. We'll focus on whether the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Key Observations
The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
This simplifies to:
\[ a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b \]
\[ a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1) \]
For \(a\) to be an integer, \(k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1\) must be an integer. This implies that \(a\) must be of the form \(b \cdot t\) where \(t\) is an integer. Therefore, \(\gcd(a, b) = b\) if \(t\) is coprime with \(b\).

### Simplifying Further
For each \(b\) from \(1\) to \(m\), we need to count valid \(a\) values:
- \(a\) can be \(b, 2b, 3b, \ldots, \left(\frac{n}{b}\right) \cdot b\).
- We need to ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b^2\), which simplifies to checking if \((a + b) \mod b^2 = 0\).

### Implementation Analysis
The function `func_15()` seems to implement the logic for counting valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\):
```python
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```
- The function iterates over possible values of \(i\) (which seems to represent \(b\) in the simplified form).
- It calculates the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(i\) and sums them up.
- The condition \((n + i) // (i * i)\) seems to count the number of multiples of \(i\) up to \(n\) that satisfy the condition.

### Detailed Reasoning with Annotations
Let's verify the annotations and the logic of `func_15()`:
- **State of the program right before the function call**: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^6\) and \(1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).
- **Function `func_15()`**:
  - Reads `n` and `m` using `func_7()`.
  - Initializes `i = 1` and `ans = 0`.
  - Iterates while \(i \le m\) and \(i * i \le n + i\).
  - For each \(i\), it calculates \((n + i) // (i * i)\) and adds it to `ans`.
  - Returns `ans - 1`.

### Verification
The logic in `func_15()` is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) by iterating over possible values of \(b\) (represented by \(i\)) and checking the condition. The condition \((n + i) // (i * i)\) is derived from the requirement that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b^2\).

However, the final subtraction of 1 in `return ans - 1` is questionable. Given the problem constraints and the nature of the problem, this subtraction might be incorrect. Specifically, the subtraction of 1 might not be justified in all cases, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios.

### Conclusion
Based on the detailed analysis and the annotations, the logic in `func_15()` seems mostly correct, but the final subtraction of 1 in `return ans - 1` might be incorrect. This could lead to incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the potential issue with the final subtraction of 1 in `func_15()`.
