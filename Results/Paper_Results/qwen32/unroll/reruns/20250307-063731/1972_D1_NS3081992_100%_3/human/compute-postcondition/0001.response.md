To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of the functions `func_10()` and `func_15()`. However, since their definitions are not provided, we will make reasonable assumptions based on the typical behavior of such functions in similar contexts.

1. **Assumption for `func_10()`**: This function likely returns the number of iterations the loop should run. Given the context, it could return a value based on `n` and `m` or a fixed value. For the sake of this problem, let's assume `func_10()` returns a value `k` which is the number of iterations the loop will run.

2. **Assumption for `func_15()`**: This function likely returns a value that needs to be printed in each iteration. It could be a constant value, a value derived from `n` and `m`, or something else. For simplicity, let's assume `func_15()` returns a value `v` in each iteration.

Given these assumptions, the loop will run `k` times, and in each iteration, it will print the value `v` followed by a newline.

Since the exact values of `k` and `v` are not specified, we can only describe the final state in terms of these variables. The output will consist of `k` lines, each containing the value `v`.

Thus, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **The output consists of `k` lines, each containing the value `v`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.**
