No variables are present in the function signature. The function `func_7` is not directly related to the problem description provided. However, based on the example usage, it can be inferred that `func_7` is expected to read a line of input, split it into components, convert them to integers, and return the list of these integers. This function likely serves to read input for a test case, where the input consists of two integers `n` and `m`.
