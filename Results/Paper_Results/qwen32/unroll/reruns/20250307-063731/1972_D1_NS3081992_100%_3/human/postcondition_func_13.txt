The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, its length `n`, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It adjusts `k` by decreasing it with the sum of `m - a[i]` for all elements `a[i]` in `a` that are less than `m`. The function returns 1 if the adjusted `k` is non-negative; otherwise, it returns -1.
