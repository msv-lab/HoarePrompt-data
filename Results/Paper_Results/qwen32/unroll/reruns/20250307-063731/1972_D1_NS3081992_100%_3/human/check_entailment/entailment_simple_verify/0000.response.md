### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count all valid pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the given conditions. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Loop Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` in `func_15` is indeed too restrictive. This condition ensures that the loop only runs for values of \(i\) up to \(\sqrt{n + i}\), which is insufficient to cover all possible values of \(b\). The problem requires iterating over all values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).

2. **Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not properly handled by this formula. The formula does not account for the gcd condition directly and incorrectly assumes that the number of valid \(a\) values can be determined by simple division.

3. **Off-by-One Error**:
   - The final result is adjusted by subtracting 1 (`return ans - 1`), which is incorrect and likely a mistake. There is no logical reason to subtract 1 from the final count of valid pairs.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), count the number of valid \(a\) values such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    ans = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    return ans
```

This approach ensures that we check all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and correctly count those that satisfy the given condition.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find all valid pairs. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is indeed **False**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
