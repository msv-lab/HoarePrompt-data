### Reasoning:

The task is to determine if the given program correctly solves the problem described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the provided functions and their roles:

1. **Input Reading Functions (func_1 to func_11)**:
   - These functions handle reading input from standard input. They are correctly implemented for reading integers and lists of integers from input, which is necessary for processing each test case.

2. **Function 12 (func_12)**:
   - This function seems to be related to some graph traversal or ranking mechanism, which is not directly relevant to the problem at hand. It appears to be an unrelated piece of code.

3. **Function 13 (func_13)**:
   - This function calculates the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\), along with coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \gcd(a, b)\). This is useful for computing the gcd, which is needed in the problem.

4. **Function 14 (func_14)**:
   - This function appears to be related to some adjustment mechanism involving a list `a`, integers `m` and `k`. It does not seem relevant to the problem's requirements.

5. **Function 15 (func_15)**:
   - This function calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\). It uses a loop to iterate over possible values of \(i\) and counts the number of pairs that satisfy the given condition. The logic seems to be based on the mathematical property of the gcd and the conditions provided in the problem.

6. **Function 16 (func_16)**:
   - This function orchestrates the reading of input and the execution of `func_15` for each test case. It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calls `func_15` and prints the result.

### Analysis of Function 15:

The core of the solution lies in `func_15`. Here is the logic of `func_15`:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

The loop in `func_15` iterates over possible values of \(i\) and counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) by checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The loop runs while \(i \le m\) and \(i * i \le n + i\). The count is accumulated in `ans`, and finally, `ans - 1` is returned.

### Verification:

The logic in `func_15` seems to be based on a mathematical insight that simplifies the problem. The key part is the loop condition and the calculation inside the loop, which ensures that the pairs \((a, b)\) are counted correctly.

### Conclusion:

Given the description of the problem and the behavior of the functions, particularly `func_15`, the program appears to be correctly implemented to solve the problem. The other functions are either input reading functions or unrelated code that does not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
