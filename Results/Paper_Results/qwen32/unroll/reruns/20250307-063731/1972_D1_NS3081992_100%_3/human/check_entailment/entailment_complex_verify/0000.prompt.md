You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, its length `n`, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It adjusts `k` by decreasing it with the sum of `m - a[i]` for all elements `a[i]` in `a` that are less than `m`. The function returns 1 if the adjusted `k` is non-negative; otherwise, it returns -1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a function `func_15` that attempts to solve the problem, but it does not correctly implement the logic to count all valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the logic in `func_15`:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Loop Condition**: The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is too restrictive. It only considers values of \(i\) up to \(\sqrt{n + i}\), which is insufficient to cover all possible values of \(b\).
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not properly handled.
3. **Off-by-One Error**: The final result is adjusted by subtracting 1 (`return ans - 1`), which is incorrect and likely a mistake.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), count the number of valid \(a\) values such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    ans = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    return ans
```

This approach ensures that we check all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and correctly count those that satisfy the given condition.

Since the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find all valid pairs, the correctness is **False**.
