Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a function `func_16()` which is responsible for handling the input and output for the problem at hand. It calls `func_15()` for each test case. However, `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The function `func_15()` does not correctly compute this.

Here is a brief explanation of why `func_15()` is incorrect:
- The function only iterates up to `√(n + i)` and checks divisibility, which is not sufficient to count all valid pairs `(a, b)`.
- It does not consider all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given constraints.
- The subtraction of `1` at the end of the function is arbitrary and does not make sense in the context of counting valid pairs.

To solve the problem correctly, a different approach is needed. One possible approach involves iterating over all possible values of `b` and then finding all valid `a` for each `b` that satisfy the given conditions. This can be optimized using mathematical insights, such as iterating over divisors of `a + b` or using properties of the greatest common divisor.

Since the provided program does not implement a correct solution, the response is:
Correctness: **False**
