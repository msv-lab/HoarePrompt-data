Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a function `func_15` that attempts to solve the problem, but it does not correctly implement the logic to count all valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the logic in `func_15`:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Loop Condition**: The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is too restrictive. It only considers values of \(i\) up to \(\sqrt{n + i}\), which is insufficient to cover all possible values of \(b\).
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not properly handled.
3. **Off-by-One Error**: The final result is adjusted by subtracting 1 (`return ans - 1`), which is incorrect and likely a mistake.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), count the number of valid \(a\) values such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    ans = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    return ans
```

This approach ensures that we check all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and correctly count those that satisfy the given condition.

Since the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find all valid pairs, the correctness is **False**.
