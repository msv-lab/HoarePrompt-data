t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min((n*(n-1))/2, 2*10^5). Each of the next m lines contains integers u, v, and w such that 1 <= u, v <= n, u != v, and 1 <= w <= 10^6. The sum of all m values across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.
