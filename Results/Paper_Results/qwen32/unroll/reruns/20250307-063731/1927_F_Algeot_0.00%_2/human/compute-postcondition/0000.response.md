The provided code snippet only sets the recursion limit to \(10^6\) using `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `u`, `v`, or `w`. It simply adjusts the recursion limit for the Python interpreter to handle deeper recursive calls if needed.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min((n*(n-1))/2, 2*10^5). Each of the next m lines contains integers u, v, and w such that 1 <= u, v <= n, u != v, and 1 <= w <= 10^6. The recursion limit is set to 10^6. The sum of all m values across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.**
