Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:

The provided program seems to be attempting to solve the problem by using prefix XOR values and binary search, but there are some issues that could lead to incorrect results.

Let's break down the code and identify potential problems:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates prefix XOR values for the array and stores them in the list `x`.
   - It also maintains a dictionary `inds` that stores the indices where each prefix XOR value appears.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, it checks if the prefix XOR values at the start and end of the subarray are the same.
   - If they are the same, it directly prints "Yes".
   - If they are not the same, it attempts to find a valid split point using binary search within the indices stored in `inds`.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Binary Search Function**:
   - The `func_2` and `func_3` functions are using a binary search to find indices, but the logic seems flawed. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not correctly handle all cases and might not find the correct split point.
   - The `func_4` function adds 1 to the result of `func_2`, which might be incorrect depending on the context.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if the subarray has only two elements and they are not equal, the program might incorrectly print "Yes" or "No" without properly checking if a valid split exists.

3. **Logic for Splitting**:
   - The logic for finding a valid split point in the subarray is not robust. The program uses indices from `inds` to find potential split points, but it does not ensure that the XOR values between these points are equal.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 1
1 2 3
1 3
```
The subarray `[1, 2, 3]` should be checked for whether it can be split into parts with equal XOR values. The correct answer is "NO" because there is no way to split `[1, 2, 3]` into two parts with equal XOR values. However, the program might incorrectly print "Yes" due to the flawed logic in the binary search and index handling.

### Conclusion:

Given the potential issues with the binary search and index handling, the program does not guarantee correctness for all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
