You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array, q is a positive integer representing the number of queries, a is a list of integers where each integer is in the range [0, 2^30), l and r are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
def func_5():
    n, q = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
        
    #State: 
    for i in range(q):
        l, r = func_1(int)
        
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        
        lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
        
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
        
        if upper > lower:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The variables `l` and `r` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop. The output will consist of a series of 'Yes' or 'No' printed statements based on the conditions checked in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, and `r`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array, `q` is a positive integer representing the number of queries, `a` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range [0, 2^30), and `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The function performs `q` queries on the array `a` and returns the result of each query, which is not specified in detail here.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
