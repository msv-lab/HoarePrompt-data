To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `q`. The loop will execute if `q` is greater than 0, as `range(q)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `q-1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `q`:** This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `q` must be greater than 0.
2. **Variable `i`:** This variable is the loop variable that takes on the values generated by `range(q)`. Before the loop starts, `i` does not need to be explicitly set because it will be initialized by the `for` loop construct.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `q` to ensure that the loop will execute. The variable `i` does not need to be set before the loop starts.

State: **`q` must be greater than 0**
