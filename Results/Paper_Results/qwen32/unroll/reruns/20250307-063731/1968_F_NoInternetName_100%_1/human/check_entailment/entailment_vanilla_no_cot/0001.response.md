### Reasoning:

The given problem requires determining if a subarray can be split into two or more parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same. The solution provided uses a clever approach involving prefix XOR and binary search to efficiently answer the queries.

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
    - The program calculates the prefix XOR for the array. The prefix XOR at index `i` (denoted as `x[i]`) is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the `i-th` element.
    - This allows us to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray using the formula: `XOR(l, r) = x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.

2. **Index Mapping**:
    - The program uses a dictionary `inds` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs. This helps in efficiently finding the positions where a specific prefix XOR value has been seen before.

3. **Query Processing**:
    - For each query, the program first checks if the prefix XOR of the entire subarray (`x[r] ^ x[l-1]`) is zero. If it is, the subarray can trivially be split into parts with the same XOR value (by splitting at any point).
    - If the prefix XOR is not zero, the program uses binary search to find the closest indices where the prefix XOR values match the required conditions. Specifically, it finds the largest index `lower` before `l` where the prefix XOR matches `x[r]` and the smallest index `upper` after `l-1` where the prefix XOR matches `x[l-1]`.
    - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it means there exists a valid split point within the subarray, and the subarray is interesting.

4. **Binary Search Functions**:
    - The functions `func_2` and `func_3` perform binary search to find the largest and smallest indices that satisfy a given predicate, respectively.
    - `func_4` and `func_3` are utility functions that adjust the indices returned by the binary search functions to be 1-based.

5. **Correctness of the Approach**:
    - The approach leverages the properties of XOR and prefix sums to efficiently determine if a subarray can be split into parts with the same XOR value.
    - The use of binary search ensures that each query is processed in logarithmic time relative to the number of occurrences of each prefix XOR value, making the solution efficient enough for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It efficiently calculates the prefix XOR, uses binary search to find valid split points, and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
