You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the provided code and verify if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine if a subarray can be split into more than one segment such that the bitwise XOR of elements in each segment is equal.

### Code Explanation

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n`, the number of queries `q`, the array `a`, and the queries `(l, r)`.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The code calculates the prefix XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the XOR of elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1`.
   - It also maintains a dictionary `inds` that maps each prefix XOR value to the list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the code checks if the subarray `a[l-1:r]` can be split into segments with equal XOR.
   - It first checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]`. If true, it means the entire subarray has a zero XOR, which is trivially interesting.
   - If not, it attempts to find indices `lower` and `upper` in the `inds` dictionary that correspond to the prefix XOR values `x[r]` and `x[l-1]` respectively, such that `lower < l` and `upper <= r`.
   - If such indices exist and `upper > lower`, it means there is a valid split of the subarray with equal XOR segments, and the code prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Correctness Analysis
The core idea of the solution is to use the prefix XOR array to efficiently determine if a subarray can be split into segments with equal XOR. The use of binary search (via `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`) to find the appropriate indices in the `inds` dictionary ensures that the solution is efficient.

However, there is a subtle issue in the implementation:
- The `func_4` function is supposed to find the smallest index greater than a given value, but the logic is incorrect. It should be modified to find the smallest index greater than `l` in `inds[x[r]]`.
- Similarly, `func_3` should find the largest index less than or equal to `r` in `inds[x[l-1]]`.

Given the current implementation, the code might not correctly handle all edge cases, especially when the subarray cannot be split into valid segments.

### Conclusion
The provided code has logical issues in the binary search functions that affect its correctness. Therefore, the code is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
