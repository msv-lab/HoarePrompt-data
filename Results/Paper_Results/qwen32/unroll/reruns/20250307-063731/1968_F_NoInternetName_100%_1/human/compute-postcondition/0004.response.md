The code appends the value `0` to the list associated with the key `0` in the `inds` defaultdict. This means that the list `inds[0]` will now contain the single element `0`.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers returned by `func_1`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is a list containing the single element `0`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0]`.**
