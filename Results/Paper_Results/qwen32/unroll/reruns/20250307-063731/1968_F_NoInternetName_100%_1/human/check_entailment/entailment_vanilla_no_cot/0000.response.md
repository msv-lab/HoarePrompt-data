To determine if the provided program is correct based on the problem description, we need to analyze its logic and ensure it accurately solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if a subarray can be divided into \( k > 1 \) parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.
- For each query, given a subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \), we need to check if it's possible to split it into parts with equal XOR values.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) (number of elements in the array) and \( q \) (number of queries).
   - It reads the array \( a \) of length \( n \).
   - For each query, it reads \( l \) and \( r \).

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - It also maintains an index dictionary `inds` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it checks if the XOR of the subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \) is zero (i.e., `x[l-1] == x[r]`).
   - If the XOR is zero, it prints "Yes" because the subarray can be trivially split into parts with equal XOR (each part having XOR 0).
   - If the XOR is not zero, it tries to find a valid split:
     - It finds the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than \( l \).
     - It finds the smallest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to \( r \).
     - If `upper > lower`, it prints "Yes" because a valid split is possible. Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Correctness:

The logic for checking if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values is sound. Here are the key points:

- If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, the subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r \) can be trivially split into parts with XOR 0.
- If `x[l-1] != x[r]`, the program correctly attempts to find a valid split by using the prefix XOR values and their indices.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
