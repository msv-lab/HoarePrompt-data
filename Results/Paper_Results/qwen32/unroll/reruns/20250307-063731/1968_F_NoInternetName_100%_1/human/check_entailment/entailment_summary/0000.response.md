### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a subarray can be split into more than one segment such that the bitwise XOR of elements in each segment is equal. The solution involves processing the array and answering multiple queries efficiently.

Here's a breakdown of the functions and their roles:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Reads a line of input, splits it into substrings, and applies the provided `cast` function to each substring.
   - This is used for reading integers from input.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Implements a binary search to find the largest index in the list `arr` for which the `predicate` function returns `True`.
   - This function is used to find indices in the list of cumulative XOR values that meet certain conditions.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - Simply calls `func_2` with the same arguments.
   - This function is redundant and does not add any unique functionality.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - Calls `func_2` and adds 1 to the result if it is not `None`.
   - This function is used to find the next index in the list of cumulative XOR values that is less than a given value `l`.

5. **Function `func_5`**:
   - Reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - Reads the array `a` and computes the cumulative XOR values stored in the list `x`.
   - Maintains a dictionary `inds` where keys are cumulative XOR values and values are lists of indices where these XOR values occur.
   - For each query, it checks if the subarray from `l` to `r` can be split into segments with equal XOR values.
   - It uses the `inds` dictionary and the `func_2` and `func_4` functions to find indices that satisfy the conditions for the subarray to be interesting.

### Analysis:

- **Cumulative XOR Calculation**: The cumulative XOR values in `x` are used to determine if a subarray can be split into segments with equal XOR values. If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it means the XOR of the entire subarray is zero, which implies that it can be split into segments with equal XOR values.
- **Index Search**: The `inds` dictionary helps quickly find indices where specific cumulative XOR values occur. The binary search functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) are used to find the appropriate indices for the subarray to be interesting.
- **Query Handling**: Each query is handled by checking if the subarray can be split into segments with equal XOR values based on the cumulative XOR values and the indices stored in `inds`.

### Conclusion:

The provided functions together correctly implement the solution for the problem. They efficiently handle the input, compute cumulative XOR values, and answer each query by checking the conditions for the subarray to be interesting. There are no logical errors or inefficiencies that would cause incorrect results.

**Correctness: True**
