You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:

The provided program seems to be attempting to solve the problem by using prefix XOR values and binary search, but there are some issues that could lead to incorrect results.

Let's break down the code and identify potential problems:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates prefix XOR values for the array and stores them in the list `x`.
   - It also maintains a dictionary `inds` that stores the indices where each prefix XOR value appears.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, it checks if the prefix XOR values at the start and end of the subarray are the same.
   - If they are the same, it directly prints "Yes".
   - If they are not the same, it attempts to find a valid split point using binary search within the indices stored in `inds`.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Binary Search Function**:
   - The `func_2` and `func_3` functions are using a binary search to find indices, but the logic seems flawed. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not correctly handle all cases and might not find the correct split point.
   - The `func_4` function adds 1 to the result of `func_2`, which might be incorrect depending on the context.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if the subarray has only two elements and they are not equal, the program might incorrectly print "Yes" or "No" without properly checking if a valid split exists.

3. **Logic for Splitting**:
   - The logic for finding a valid split point in the subarray is not robust. The program uses indices from `inds` to find potential split points, but it does not ensure that the XOR values between these points are equal.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 1
1 2 3
1 3
```
The subarray `[1, 2, 3]` should be checked for whether it can be split into parts with equal XOR values. The correct answer is "NO" because there is no way to split `[1, 2, 3]` into two parts with equal XOR values. However, the program might incorrectly print "Yes" due to the flawed logic in the binary search and index handling.

### Conclusion:

Given the potential issues with the binary search and index handling, the program does not guarantee correctness for all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
