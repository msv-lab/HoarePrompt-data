Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, and `r`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array, `q` is a positive integer representing the number of queries, `a` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range [0, 2^30), and `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The function performs `q` queries on the array `a` and returns the result of each query, which is not specified in detail here.**
