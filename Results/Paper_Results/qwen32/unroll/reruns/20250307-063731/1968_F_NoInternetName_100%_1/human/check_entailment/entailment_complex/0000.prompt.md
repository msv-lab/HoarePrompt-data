Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

# Annotated Functions:
from collections import defaultdict

if __name__ == '__main__':
    (t,) = func_1(int)
    for _ in range(t):
        func_5()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cast is a function that can be applied to each element of the input string split by spaces, typically used to convert strings to integers.
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the function `cast` to each element of the input string split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a function `cast` as an argument, reads a line of input from the user, splits this input into substrings separated by spaces, applies the `cast` function to each substring, and returns a map object containing the results.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and predicate is a function that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean value. The function `func_2` is used to find the largest index `l` such that `predicate(arr[l])` is True, with the search range being from 0 to the length of `arr`.
def func_2(arr, predicate):
    l, r = 0, len(arr)
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if predicate(arr[mid]):
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: 
    if predicate(arr[l]) :
        return l
        #The program returns the index `l` which is within the bounds of the list `arr` and satisfies the condition `predicate(arr[l])` being true.
    #State: `arr` is a list, `l` is an index within the bounds of `arr`, and `predicate(arr[l])` is false.
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`. It returns the largest index `l` in `arr` for which `predicate(arr[l])` is True. If no such index exists, it returns None.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and predicate is a function that takes a list as an argument.
def func_3(arr, predicate):
    return func_2(arr, predicate)
    #The program returns the result of `func_2(arr, predicate)`, where `arr` is a list of integers and `predicate` is a function that takes a list as an argument.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes a list of integers `arr` and a function `predicate` as parameters, and returns the result of applying the `predicate` function to the `arr` list.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and predicate is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean value.
def func_4(arr, predicate):
    result = func_2(arr, predicate)
    if (result is not None) :
        return result + 1
        #The program attempts to return `result + 1`, where `result` is a list of integers from `arr` that satisfy `predicate`. This operation would result in a TypeError in a real Python environment.
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers, `predicate` is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean value, `result` is a list of integers from `arr` that satisfy `predicate`. `result` is None
    return None
    #The program returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`. It attempts to return a value that results from adding 1 to a list of integers from `arr` that satisfy `predicate`, which would cause a TypeError. If this operation fails, it returns `None`.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array, q is a positive integer representing the number of queries, a is a list of integers where each integer is in the range [0, 2^30), l and r are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
def func_5():
    n, q = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)

            continue
        
        lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
        
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
        
        if upper > lower:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The variables `l` and `r` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop. The output will consist of a series of 'Yes' or 'No' printed statements based on the conditions checked in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an array of integers and performs a series of queries to determine if there exists a subarray within specified ranges that has a XOR value of zero. For each query, it prints 'Yes' if such a subarray exists and 'No' otherwise.
