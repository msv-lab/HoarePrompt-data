Let's break down the provided code and verify if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine if a subarray can be split into more than one segment such that the bitwise XOR of elements in each segment is equal.

### Code Explanation

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n`, the number of queries `q`, the array `a`, and the queries `(l, r)`.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The code calculates the prefix XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the XOR of elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1`.
   - It also maintains a dictionary `inds` that maps each prefix XOR value to the list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the code checks if the subarray `a[l-1:r]` can be split into segments with equal XOR.
   - It first checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]`. If true, it means the entire subarray has a zero XOR, which is trivially interesting.
   - If not, it attempts to find indices `lower` and `upper` in the `inds` dictionary that correspond to the prefix XOR values `x[r]` and `x[l-1]` respectively, such that `lower < l` and `upper <= r`.
   - If such indices exist and `upper > lower`, it means there is a valid split of the subarray with equal XOR segments, and the code prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Correctness Analysis
The core idea of the solution is to use the prefix XOR array to efficiently determine if a subarray can be split into segments with equal XOR. The use of binary search (via `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`) to find the appropriate indices in the `inds` dictionary ensures that the solution is efficient.

However, there is a subtle issue in the implementation:
- The `func_4` function is supposed to find the smallest index greater than a given value, but the logic is incorrect. It should be modified to find the smallest index greater than `l` in `inds[x[r]]`.
- Similarly, `func_3` should find the largest index less than or equal to `r` in `inds[x[l-1]]`.

Given the current implementation, the code might not correctly handle all edge cases, especially when the subarray cannot be split into valid segments.

### Conclusion
The provided code has logical issues in the binary search functions that affect its correctness. Therefore, the code is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
