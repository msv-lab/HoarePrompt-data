The code snippet provided is:
```python
n, q = func_1(int)
```

This line of code suggests that `n` and `q` are being assigned values returned from the function `func_1` which takes an integer as an argument. However, since the function `func_1` and its behavior are not defined, we can only assume that `n` and `q` will be updated to whatever values `func_1` returns.

Given that the initial state specifies that `n` and `q` are positive integers, we can infer that `func_1` likely returns two positive integers. But without the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `q` after the function call.

Since the problem asks to be as specific as possible and to include all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed, we will assume that `func_1` returns new positive integer values for `n` and `q`.

Therefore, the Output State can be described as:
Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers returned by `func_1`, `a` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range [0, 2^30), `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` and `q` have been updated to new positive integer values returned by `func_1`. The other variables `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged in terms of their descriptions.
