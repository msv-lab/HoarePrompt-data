Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers returned by `func_1`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is a list containing the single element `0`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists.**

Explanation: The variable `inds` is initialized as a defaultdict of lists. All other variables (`n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `x`) retain their original values and conditions as specified in the initial state.
