### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining if a subarray is "interesting" based on the XOR property. The program consists of several functions, each serving a specific purpose. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program works and whether it meets the problem requirements:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: To read input values and convert them to integers.
   - **Functionality**: It reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and applies the `cast` function (typically `int`) to each element.
   - **Correctness**: This function is correctly implemented for reading and converting input values.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: To find the largest index `l` in a list `arr` such that `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`.
   - **Functionality**: It uses a binary search approach to find the largest index that satisfies the predicate.
   - **Correctness**: The binary search implementation is correct and efficiently finds the desired index.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - **Purpose**: To call `func_2` with the provided `arr` and `predicate`.
   - **Functionality**: It simply calls `func_2` and returns its result.
   - **Correctness**: This function is correctly implemented as a wrapper for `func_2`.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - **Purpose**: To call `func_2` and add 1 to the result.
   - **Functionality**: It calls `func_2` and adds 1 to the result if it is not `None`.
   - **Correctness**: This function is correctly implemented, but it's worth noting that the comment suggesting a `TypeError` is incorrect; adding 1 to an integer is valid.

5. **Function `func_5`**:
   - **Purpose**: To process each test case, including reading the array and performing queries.
   - **Functionality**:
     - It reads the array and computes a prefix XOR array `x`, where `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array.
     - It uses a dictionary `inds` to store indices where each XOR value occurs.
     - For each query, it checks if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.
     - It uses `func_2` and `func_3` to find the appropriate indices for the subarray.
   - **Correctness**: The logic for computing the prefix XOR and using the indices to check the subarray conditions is correct. The use of binary search (`func_2` and `func_3`) ensures efficient querying.

### Conclusion:

The program is correctly implemented to solve the given problem. It reads input, processes the array to compute prefix XOR values, and efficiently checks each query using binary search. The output is consistent with the problem requirements, and the provided example outputs match the expected results.

**Correctness: True**
