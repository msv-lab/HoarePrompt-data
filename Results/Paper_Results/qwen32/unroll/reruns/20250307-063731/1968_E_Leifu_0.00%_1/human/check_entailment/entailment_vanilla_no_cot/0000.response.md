Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). The program only handles specific cases for \(n = 2\), \(n = 3\), and \(n \geq 4\) in a way that does not guarantee the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for all \(n\).

For example, the program outputs the same points for \(n = 4\) and \(n = 5\) (after the first three points), which does not maximize the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 5\). The arrangement should be different to achieve the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances.

To correctly solve the problem, a more strategic placement of points is required, such as placing points along the perimeter of the grid or using a pattern that ensures a wide range of Manhattan distances.
