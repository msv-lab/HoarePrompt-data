Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and for each of the following `t` lines, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^3.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to be the integer value obtained from the input, which is constrained to be between 1 and 50 inclusive. The information about `n` remains unchanged as the code snippet provided does not affect `n`.
