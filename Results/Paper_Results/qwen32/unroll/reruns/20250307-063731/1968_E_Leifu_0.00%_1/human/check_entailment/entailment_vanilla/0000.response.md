Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The task is to choose n cells in an n x n grid to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.

The provided program handles multiple test cases. For each test case, it outputs a specific set of points. Let's break down the program's output for different values of n:

1. For n = 2:
   - The program outputs: (1, 1) and (1, 2)
   - Distances: |1-1| + |1-2| = 1
   - Set of distances: {0, 1} (0 is included because the distance between a point and itself is 0)
   - This is correct since the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for n = 2 is 2.

2. For n = 3:
   - The program outputs: (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3)
   - Distances: |1-1| + |1-2| = 1, |1-1| + |1-3| = 2, |1-2| + |2-3| = 2, and |1-2| + |1-1| = 1, |2-1| + |3-2| = 2, |2-3| + |1-1| = 2
   - Set of distances: {0, 1, 2}
   - This is correct since the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for n = 3 is 3.

3. For n >= 4:
   - The program outputs: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), and (j, j) for j from 4 to n
   - Let's analyze the distances:
     - The distance between (1, 1) and (1, 2) is 1.
     - The distance between (1, 1) and (2, 4) is |1-2| + |1-4| = 4.
     - The distance between (1, 2) and (2, 4) is |1-2| + |2-4| = 3.
     - The distance between (1, 1) and (j, j) is |1-j| + |1-j| = 2(j-1).
     - The distance between (1, 2) and (j, j) is |1-j| + |2-j| = 2(j-1) - 1.
     - The distance between (2, 4) and (j, j) is |2-j| + |4-j| = 2(j-3).
     - The distance between (j, j) and (k, k) for j != k is 2|j-k|.
   - The set of distances includes 0 (distance between a point and itself), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, ..., 2(n-1) - 2, 2(n-1) - 1, 2(n-1).
   - The size of the set is not maximized for n >= 4. For example, for n = 4, the program outputs points that result in the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, but the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances is 5, which can be achieved with other configurations.

Given the analysis, the program does not always output the configuration that maximizes the set of distinct Manhattan distances for n >= 4. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
