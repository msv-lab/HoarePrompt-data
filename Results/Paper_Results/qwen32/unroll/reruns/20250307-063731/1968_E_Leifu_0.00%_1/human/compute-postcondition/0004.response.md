Functionality: **The function processes a series of integers `n` (where `2 <= n <= 1000`), each provided after an initial integer `t` (where `1 <= t <= 50`). For each `n`, it prints a specific sequence of pairs of integers. The sequence starts with '1 1' and '1 2'. If `n` is 3, it prints '2 3'. Otherwise, it prints '2 4' followed by pairs of the form 'j j' for each `j` from 4 to `n`.**
