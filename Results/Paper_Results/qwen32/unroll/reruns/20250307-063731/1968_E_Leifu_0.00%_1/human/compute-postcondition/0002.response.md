To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the code step-by-step.

The given code snippet is a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is an integer input. For each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and then prints a series of pairs of integers based on the value of `n`.

Here's the breakdown of what happens in each iteration of the loop:

1. `print('1 1')` - Always prints the pair `1 1`.
2. `print('1 2')` - Always prints the pair `1 2`.
3. If `n == 3`:
   - `print('2 3')` - Prints the pair `2 3`.
4. Else:
   - `print('2 4')` - Prints the pair `2 4`.
   - A nested loop runs from `j = 4` to `j = n`, printing the pair `j j` for each `j`.

After the loop completes all `t` iterations, the output will be a series of printed pairs for each input `n` as described above.

Since the initial state only specifies the values for `t` and `n` for each iteration, and the code does not modify any other variables outside the loop, the output state will be a series of printed pairs, with no changes to the initial state variables `t` and `n` for each iteration.

Output State: **A series of printed pairs for each input `n`, where the pairs are determined by the logic described in the code. No changes to the initial state variables `t` and `n`.**
