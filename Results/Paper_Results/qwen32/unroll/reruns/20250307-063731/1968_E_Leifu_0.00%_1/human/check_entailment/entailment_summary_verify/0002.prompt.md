You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print('1 1')
        print('1 2')
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of integers `n` (where `2 <= n <= 1000`), each provided after an initial integer `t` (where `1 <= t <= 50`). For each `n`, it prints a specific sequence of pairs of integers. The sequence starts with '1 1' and '1 2'. If `n` is 3, it prints '2 3'. Otherwise, it prints '2 4' followed by pairs of the form 'j j' for each `j` from 4 to `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The task is to choose n cells in an n x n grid to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.

The provided program handles multiple test cases. For each test case, it outputs a specific set of points. Let's break down the program's output for different values of n:

1. For n = 2:
   - The program outputs: (1, 1) and (1, 2)
   - Distances: |1-1| + |1-2| = 1
   - Set of distances: {0, 1} (0 is included because the distance between a point and itself is 0)
   - This is correct since the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for n = 2 is 2.

2. For n = 3:
   - The program outputs: (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3)
   - Distances: |1-1| + |1-2| = 1, |1-1| + |1-3| = 2, |1-2| + |2-3| = 2, and |1-2| + |1-1| = 1, |2-1| + |3-2| = 2, |2-3| + |1-1| = 2
   - Set of distances: {0, 1, 2}
   - This is correct since the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for n = 3 is 3.

3. For n >= 4:
   - The program outputs: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), and (j, j) for j from 4 to n
   - Let's analyze the distances:
     - The distance between (1, 1) and (1, 2) is 1.
     - The distance between (1, 1) and (2, 4) is |1-2| + |1-4| = 4.
     - The distance between (1, 2) and (2, 4) is |1-2| + |2-4| = 3.
     - The distance between (1, 1) and (j, j) is |1-j| + |1-j| = 2(j-1).
     - The distance between (1, 2) and (j, j) is |1-j| + |2-j| = 2(j-1) - 1.
     - The distance between (2, 4) and (j, j) is |2-j| + |4-j| = 2(j-3).
     - The distance between (j, j) and (k, k) for j != k is 2|j-k|.
   - The set of distances includes 0 (distance between a point and itself), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, ..., 2(n-1) - 2, 2(n-1) - 1, 2(n-1).
   - The size of the set is not maximized for n >= 4. For example, for n = 4, the program outputs points that result in the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, but the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances is 5, which can be achieved with other configurations.

Given the analysis, the program does not always output the configuration that maximizes the set of distinct Manhattan distances for n >= 4. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
