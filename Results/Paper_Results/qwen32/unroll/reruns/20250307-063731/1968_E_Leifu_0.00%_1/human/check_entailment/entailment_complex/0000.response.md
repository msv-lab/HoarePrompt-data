### Reasoning:

The given Python program is supposed to generate a set of `n` points on an `n x n` grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these points is maximized. The program's output is compared against the examples provided in the problem statement.

The program logic for generating points is as follows:
1. For `n = 2`, it outputs the points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
2. For `n = 3`, it outputs the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`.
3. For `n >= 4`, it outputs the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(j, j)` for `j` ranging from `4` to `n`.

Let's analyze the correctness of this logic:
1. **For `n = 2`**:
   - Points: `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
   - Distances: `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`.
   - Set of distances (`\mathcal{H}`): `{0, 1}`.
   - This matches the example provided.

2. **For `n = 3`**:
   - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`.
   - Distances: `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`, `|1-1| + |1-3| = 2`, `|1-1| + |2-3| = 2`, `|1-2| + |1-3| = 1`, `|1-2| + |2-3| = 2`, `|2-3| + |1-1| = 2`.
   - Set of distances (`\mathcal{H}`): `{0, 1, 2}`.
   - This matches the example provided.

3. **For `n >= 4`**:
   - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(j, j)` for `j` ranging from `4` to `n`.
   - Distances:
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: `1`.
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: `4`.
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(j, j)`: `2(j-1)`.
     - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: `3`.
     - Between `(1, 2)` and `(j, j)`: `2(j-1) - 1`.
     - Between `(2, 4)` and `(j, j)`: `2(j-3) + 1`.
   - The logic ensures that a variety of distances are generated, but it does not necessarily maximize the set of distinct distances for all `n`.

The program does not guarantee that the set of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized for all `n`. Specifically, the pattern used for `n >= 4` does not cover all possible distances that could be generated by placing points strategically.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not always generate the maximum possible set of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of `n`. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all test cases.

**Correctness: False**
