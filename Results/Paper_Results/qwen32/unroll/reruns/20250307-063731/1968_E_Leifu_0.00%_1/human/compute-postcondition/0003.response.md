The function `func` accepts an integer `t` such that 1 <= t <= 50. For each of the following `t` lines, it accepts an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. The function does not explicitly return a value based on the provided output description, but it is implied that it processes these inputs in some way. Since there is no specific output described, we can infer that the function performs some operation or calculations based on the provided `t` and `n` values.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 50) and processes `t` subsequent integers `n` (2 <= n <= 10^3).**
