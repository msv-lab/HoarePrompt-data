Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step against the problem description and the function summary, and see if the original assessment holds true.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if the digits form a "STAIR" by verifying the condition `a < b < c`. If true, it prints 'STAIR'.
   - Next, the program checks if `b` is the maximum of the three digits (`max(a, b, c) == b`). If true, it prints 'PEAK'.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'NONE'.

3. **Redundant Check:**
   - The original assessment mentions a redundant check for `a == b == c`, but this check is not present in the given program. Therefore, the mention of this check in the original assessment is incorrect.

4. **Correctness of Conditions:**
   - The condition `a < b < c` correctly identifies a "STAIR".
   - The condition `max(a, b, c) == b` correctly identifies a "PEAK" because if `b` is the maximum, it implies `a < b` and `b > c` or `a <= b` and `b > c` (which covers the case where `a == b`).

5. **Handling Remaining Cases:**
   - If neither `a < b < c` nor `b` is the maximum, the program correctly prints 'NONE'.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly handles all the given conditions and cases as per the problem description. The redundant check for `a == b == c` mentioned in the original assessment is not present in the code and does not affect the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
