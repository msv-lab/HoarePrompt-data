The function `func` accepts an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that each of them is between 0 and 9 inclusive. The function processes each test case independently. For each test case, the function returns the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9). It returns the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.**
