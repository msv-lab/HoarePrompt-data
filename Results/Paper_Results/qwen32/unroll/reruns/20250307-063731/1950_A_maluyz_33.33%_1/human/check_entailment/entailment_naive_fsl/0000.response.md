Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly handles the case when `a < b > c` but `a == c`. The current implementation checks if `max(a, b, c) == b` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is true for any case where `b` is the largest number, including cases where `a == c`. However, according to the problem description, a peak is defined as `a < b > c`, which means `a` and `c` must be different and less than `b`.

For example, consider the input `1 5 1`. The program will output `PEAK` because `max(1, 5, 1) == 5`, but the correct output should be `NONE` because `a` and `c` are not different.

To fix this, the condition for a peak should be `a < b and b > c`. Here is the corrected part of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

With this change, the program will correctly handle all cases as per the problem description.
