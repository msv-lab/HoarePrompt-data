The variable `c` is assigned the value of the middle element of `path_ba` since `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, which gives the index of the middle element in `path_ba` (because the length of `path_ba` is odd). The other variables (`path_ba`, `ops`, and `ci`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path_ba` contains the vertices of the shortest path from `b` to `a` in order from `b` to `a`, and the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ops` is an empty list; `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2; `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.**
