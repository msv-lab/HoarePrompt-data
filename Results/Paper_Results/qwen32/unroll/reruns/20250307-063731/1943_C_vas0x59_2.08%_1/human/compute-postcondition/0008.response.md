Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list representing the shortest distance from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to vertex `i`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)` which is equal to `a`; `path_ba` is a list containing a single element `b`.**
