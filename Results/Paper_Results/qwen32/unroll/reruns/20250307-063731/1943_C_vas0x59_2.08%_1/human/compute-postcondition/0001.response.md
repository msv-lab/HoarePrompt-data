The code snippet `u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]` creates a new list of lists, where each sublist is initialized as an empty list. The number of sublists is determined by the value of `n`. This means that `u2vs` is now a list containing `n` empty lists.

The variables `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `n` is the integer value provided by user input, and `u` and `v` are integers representing the vertices connected by an edge in the tree such that 0 <= u, v < n.**
