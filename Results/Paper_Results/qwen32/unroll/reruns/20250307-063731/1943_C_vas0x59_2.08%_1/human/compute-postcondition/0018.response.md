The code calculates the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2 and assigns the result to `c2`. Given that the length of `path_ba` is even, `c2` will be an integer representing exactly half the number of vertices in `path_ba`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`path_ba` contains the vertices of the shortest path from `b` to `a` in order from `b` to `a`; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.**
