Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list representing the shortest distance from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to vertex `i`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)` which is equal to `a`; `path_ba` is a list containing a single element `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
