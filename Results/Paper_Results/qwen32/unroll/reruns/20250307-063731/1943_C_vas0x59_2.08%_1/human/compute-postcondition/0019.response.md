The code snippet assigns the value of `c2 - 1` to the variable `c1`. Since `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and the length of `path_ba` is even, `c2` is an integer. Therefore, `c1` will be one less than `c2`.

Output State: **`path_ba` contains the vertices of the shortest path from `b` to `a` in order from `b` to `a`; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**
