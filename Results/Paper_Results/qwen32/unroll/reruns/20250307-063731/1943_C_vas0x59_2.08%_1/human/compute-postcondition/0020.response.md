The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2)`. To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to focus on the `range` function's parameters.

1. **Start (1)**: The loop starts at index 1.
2. **Stop (len(path_ba) - c1)**: The loop stops before reaching `len(path_ba) - c1`.
3. **Step (2)**: The loop increments by 2.

For the loop to execute at least once, the start value (1) must be less than the stop value (`len(path_ba) - c1`). Therefore, the condition `1 < len(path_ba) - c1` must hold true.

Given that `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`, we can express `c1` as `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`.

So, for the loop to execute, we need:

\[ 1 < \text{len}(\text{path_ba}) - \left(\frac{\text{len}(\text{path_ba})}{2} - 1\right) \]

Simplifying the inequality:

\[ 1 < \frac{\text{len}(\text{path_ba})}{2} + 1 \]

\[ 0 < \frac{\text{len}(\text{path_ba})}{2} \]

\[ 0 < \text{len}(\text{path_ba}) \]

Since `len(path_ba)` is already given to be even and greater than or equal to 2 (to ensure `c1` is a valid index), the condition is already satisfied. However, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to confirm that `len(path_ba) - c1` is greater than 1.

Given `c1 = c2 - 1` and `c2 = len(path_ba) // 2`, we have `c1 = (len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`. So, the stop condition becomes:

\[ \text{len}(\text{path_ba}) - \left(\frac{\text{len}(\text{path_ba})}{2} - 1\right) = \frac{\text{len}(\text{path_ba})}{2} + 1 \]

For the loop to execute, this value must be greater than 1, which is true if `len(path_ba) >= 4`.

Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `len(path_ba)` is at least 4 to guarantee that the loop will execute.

State: **`path_ba` contains the vertices of the shortest path from `b` to `a` in order from `b` to `a` with a length of at least 4; `ops` is an empty list; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`; `i` is 1**
