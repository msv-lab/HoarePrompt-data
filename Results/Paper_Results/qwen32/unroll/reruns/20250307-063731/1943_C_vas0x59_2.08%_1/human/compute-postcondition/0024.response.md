To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. `path_ba` contains the vertices of the shortest path from `b` to `a` in order.
2. If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
   - `ops` contains tuples `(c, i)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`, where `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.
   - `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
3. If the length of `path_ba` is even:
   - `ops` contains `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3)]`.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet uses the `map` function to apply a lambda function to each tuple in `ops`. The lambda function formats each tuple `(x[0], x[1])` as a string `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`. The `print` statement then prints each formatted string on a new line.

### Output Calculation:
Let's consider both cases for the length of `path_ba`:

#### Case 1: Length of `path_ba` is Odd
- `ops` contains tuples `(c, i)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`, where `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.
- `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
- The printed output will be a series of lines, each containing `c + 1` followed by `i`.

For example, if `path_ba` has a length of 5, `ci` would be 2, and `ops` would be `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 2)]`. The printed output would be:
```
c+1 0
c+1 1
c+1 2
```

#### Case 2: Length of `path_ba` is Even
- `ops` contains `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3)]`.
- The printed output will be:
```
c1+1 1
c2+1 1
c1+1 3
c2+1 3
```

### Final Output:
Since the exact `path_ba` list is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `c`, `c1`, or `c2`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output format.

Output: **c+1 0\nc+1 1\nc+1 2 (where c is the middle element of path_ba) if length of path_ba is odd, otherwise c1+1 1\nc2+1 1\nc1+1 3\nc2+1 3 (where c1 and c2 are the middle elements of path_ba)**
