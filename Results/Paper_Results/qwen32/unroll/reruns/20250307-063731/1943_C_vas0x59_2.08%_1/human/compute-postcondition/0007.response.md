The code snippet assigns the result of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. Given that `a` is already the result of `func_1(d)`, it follows that `b` will have the same value as `a`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list representing the shortest distance from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to vertex `i`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)` which is equal to `a`.**
