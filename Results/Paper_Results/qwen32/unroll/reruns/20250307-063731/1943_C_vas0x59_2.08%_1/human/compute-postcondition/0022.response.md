Postcondition: **`path_ba` contains the vertices of the shortest path from `b` to `a` in order from `b` to `a`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples `(c, i)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`, where `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3)]`.**
