To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1(d)` does. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet or initial state. Assuming `func_1` processes the list `d` and returns a value or a new list based on it, we can only infer the output state based on the assumption that `a` will hold whatever `func_1(d)` returns.

Since the function `func_1` is not specified, we can only conclude that `a` is assigned the result of `func_1(d)`, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the indices of all vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list representing the shortest distance from vertex `0` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.**
