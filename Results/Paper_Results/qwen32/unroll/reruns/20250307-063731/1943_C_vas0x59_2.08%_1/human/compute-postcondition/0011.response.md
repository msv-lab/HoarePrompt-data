The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `ops`. This action does not affect any of the existing variables, such as `path_ba`, which still contains the vertices of the shortest path from `b` to `a` in order from `b` to `a`.

Output State: **`path_ba` contains the vertices of the shortest path from `b` to `a` in order from `b` to `a`; `ops` is an empty list.**
