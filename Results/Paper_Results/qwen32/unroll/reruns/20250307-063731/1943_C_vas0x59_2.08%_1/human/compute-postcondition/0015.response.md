To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is the `for` loop statement `for i in range(ci + 1):`. The variables involved are `i` and `ci`.

### Analysis:
1. **`ci`**: This variable is calculated as the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2. Since the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` will be an integer representing the middle index of the path (not including the middle element itself). For example, if `path_ba` has a length of 5, `ci` will be 2 (since 5 // 2 = 2).

2. **`i`**: This variable will iterate from 0 to `ci` inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `ci` must be at least 0.

### Adjustments:
- The length of `path_ba` is already given to be odd, so `ci` will naturally be a non-negative integer. This means `ci` does not need any adjustment.
- The variable `i` is initialized automatically by the `range` function in the loop, so it does not need any adjustment either.

### Conclusion:
Since the given state already ensures that `ci` is a non-negative integer (because the length of `path_ba` is odd), the loop will execute at least once. No further adjustments to `i` or `ci` are necessary.

### Final State:
State: **`path_ba` contains the vertices of the shortest path from `b` to `a` in order from `b` to `a`, and the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ops` is an empty list; `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2; `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.**
