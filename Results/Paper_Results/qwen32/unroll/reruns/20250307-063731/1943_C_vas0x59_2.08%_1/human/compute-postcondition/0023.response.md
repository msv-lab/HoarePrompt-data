Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `path_ba` contains the vertices of the shortest path from `b` to `a` in order from `b` to `a`.
2. If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
   - `ops` contains tuples `(c, i)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`, where `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
3. If the length of `path_ba` is even:
   - `ops` contains `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3)]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len(ops))
```

### Analysis:
- We need to determine the length of `ops` based on the length of `path_ba`.
- Let's consider both cases:
  1. **If the length of `path_ba` is odd:**
     - Let's denote the length of `path_ba` as `n`.
     - `ci` is the integer division of `n` by 2, i.e., `ci = n // 2`.
     - `ops` contains tuples `(c, i)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`.
     - Therefore, the number of tuples in `ops` is `ci + 1` (since `i` ranges from `0` to `ci` inclusive).
     - So, `len(ops) = n // 2 + 1`.
  2. **If the length of `path_ba` is even:**
     - `ops` contains `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3)]`.
     - Hence, the number of tuples in `ops` is 4.
     - So, `len(ops) = 4`.

### Conclusion:
- The length of `ops` depends on whether the length of `path_ba` is odd or even.
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `len(ops) = n // 2 + 1`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even, `len(ops) = 4`.

Since we do not have the specific length of `path_ba`, we describe the output in terms of the conditions given.

Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is n // 2 + 1 if the length of path_ba is odd, otherwise 4 if the length of path_ba is even)**
