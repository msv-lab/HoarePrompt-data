To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the loop and its effect on the variables involved.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initialization**: `path_ba` is initialized with a single element `b`, which is the result of `func_1(d)`.
- **Condition**: The loop continues as long as `True` until a `break` statement is encountered.
- **Body**:
  - `n = previous[path_ba[-1]]`: This line retrieves the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to the last vertex in `path_ba`.
  - `if n == -1: break`: If the previous vertex `n` is `-1`, it means there are no more vertices to add to the path, and the loop breaks.
  - `path_ba.append(n)`: If `n` is not `-1`, it appends `n` to `path_ba`.

### Output State:
The loop effectively traces the shortest path from vertex `b` back to vertex `a` using the `previous` list. It keeps appending the previous vertex to `path_ba` until it reaches a vertex whose previous vertex is `-1` (indicating the start of the path).

### Final Output State:
- `path_ba` will contain all vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order, i.e., starting from `b` and ending at `a`.

### Human-readable Output State:
The final state of `path_ba` will be a list that contains the vertices of the shortest path from `b` to `a` in order from `b` to `a`.

### Final Answer:
Output State: **`path_ba` contains the vertices of the shortest path from `b` to `a` in order from `b` to `a`.**
