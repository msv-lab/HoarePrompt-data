Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_2` is intended to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) for given n and m, but the logic implemented in `func_2` appears to be incorrect.

The condition that needs to be satisfied is that \( a + b \) should be a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). The provided code does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it seems to be trying to count something related to divisors and squares, which is not directly related to the problem's requirements.

Here's a brief outline of how the problem can be solved correctly:

1. For each pair (a, b), compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).
2. Check if \( a + b \) is divisible by \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
3. Count all such pairs.

A correct implementation might look something like this:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    m = int(data[index + 1])
    results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    index += 2

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This implementation correctly checks each pair (a, b) for the given conditions and counts the valid pairs. However, it may not be efficient enough for the large input constraints, and optimizations would be necessary for such cases.
