Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the given conditions. Let's analyze the code and the problem description in detail.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).

However, the logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the problem requirements. Here are the issues:
- The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\), which is correct, but the logic inside the loop is not aligned with the problem statement.
- The calculation of `x` and `y` does not correctly determine the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, for each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), we need to find the number of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

A correct implementation would involve:
1. Iterating over each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. For each \(b\), iterating over each \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
3. Checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the test case:
```
n = 2, m = 3
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).

The provided code will not correctly count these pairs because the logic inside `func_2` is flawed.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided code does not correctly implement the logic for counting the valid pairs \((a, b)\) in all cases, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
