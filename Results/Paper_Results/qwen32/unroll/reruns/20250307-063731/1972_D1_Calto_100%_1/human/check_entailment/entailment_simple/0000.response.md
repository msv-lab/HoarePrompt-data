### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the given program step-by-step to determine if it's correct.

**Problem Requirements:**
- We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
  - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

**Program Analysis:**
- The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
- It then calls `func_2(n, m)` to compute the number of valid pairs.
- `func_2(n, m)` uses a loop from \(i = 1\) to \(m\) and computes a count based on a formula involving \(\mathit{ceil}\) and modulo operations.

The formula inside the loop is:
\[ \text{cnt} = \text{cnt} + \mathit{ceil}\left(\frac{n - i(i - 1)}{i \cdot i}\right) + \left(\frac{n - i(i - 1)}{i \cdot i} \equiv 0 \pmod{1}\right) \]

Let's break down the formula:
- The term \(\mathit{ceil}\left(\frac{n - i(i - 1)}{i \cdot i}\right)\) calculates the ceiling of the division of \(n - i(i - 1)\) by \(i \cdot i\).
- The term \(\left(\frac{n - i(i - 1)}{i \cdot i} \equiv 0 \pmod{1}\right)\) checks if the division is exact (i.e., no remainder).

The program starts with `cnt = -1`, which implies that the final count will be off by 1 if the formula is correct. This suggests that the initial value of `cnt` should be 0, and the final result should be `cnt + 1` or the loop should start with `cnt = 0`.

However, the key question is whether the formula correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

**Verification with Examples:**
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case: \(n = 1, m = 1\)**
   - Only pair is \((1, 1)\).
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is satisfied since \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot 1\).
   - The program should output `1`.

2. **Test Case: \(n = 10, m = 8\)**
   - Valid pairs are \((1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)\).
   - The program should output `14`.

Upon closer inspection, the formula in `func_2` seems to be derived from a mathematical insight about the problem, but the initial value of `cnt` being `-1` and the loop structure need to be verified.

**Conclusion:**
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs based on the given conditions. The formula used inside `func_2` does not directly translate to the problem requirements, and the initial value of `cnt` being `-1` is suspicious.

### Correctness:
**Correctness: False**
