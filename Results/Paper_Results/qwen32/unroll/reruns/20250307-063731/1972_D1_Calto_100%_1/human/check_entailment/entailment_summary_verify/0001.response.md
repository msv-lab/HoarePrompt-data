### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function summaries to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. However, this function is not used in `func_2`, so it seems redundant for the current implementation.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.

Let's break down `func_2`:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt
```

- `cnt` is initialized to `-1`, which is unusual and likely incorrect.
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`.
- `x` is calculated as `n - (i * i - i)`.
- `y` is calculated as `i * i`.
- `cnt` is updated by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

The logic in `func_2` does not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, it does not involve the GCD or the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Function Summary Validation:
The function summary for `func_2` states:
- The function takes two positive integer parameters `n` and `m`.
- It returns the sum of `math.ceil((n - i * (i - 1)) / (i * i)) + ((n - i * (i - 1)) % (i * i) == 0)` for each integer `i` from 1 to `m`.

This summary does not reflect the correct logic for solving the problem. The given program does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each pair \((a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Example usage:
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        m = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Final: **False**
