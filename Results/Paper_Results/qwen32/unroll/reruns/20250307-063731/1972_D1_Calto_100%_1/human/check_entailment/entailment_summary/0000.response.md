Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify whether the function `func_2(n, m)` correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions:

1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The provided function `func_2(n, m)` is supposed to implement this logic, but let's analyze whether it does so correctly.

### Analysis of `func_2(n, m)`:
The function iterates over each integer \(i\) from 1 to \(m\). For each \(i\), it calculates:
- \(x = n - (i * i - i)\)
- \(y = i * i\)
- Then it adds to `cnt` the value of `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

This logic doesn't seem to directly relate to the problem's condition that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). To satisfy this condition, for each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \((a + b) \% (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

### Correct Approach:
A more straightforward way to solve the problem would be to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition for each pair. This would look something like:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Comparison:
The provided `func_2` function uses a different formula that doesn't seem to be derived from the problem's condition. The formula `math.ceil((n - i * (i - 1)) / (i * i)) + ((n - i * (i - 1)) % (i * i) == 0)` does not directly translate to counting pairs that satisfy the given condition.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided `func_2` function does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs based on the given condition, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
