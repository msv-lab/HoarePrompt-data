### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic for counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the given conditions. Let's break down the issues in the code and validate the original assessment using the annotated version.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is correct.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).

The logic inside `func_2` is flawed:
- The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\), which is correct, but the logic inside the loop is not aligned with the problem statement.
- The calculation of `x` and `y` does not correctly determine the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, but they do not reflect the correct logic for solving the problem. Specifically:
- The state of `cnt` after the loop in `func_2` is described as the sum of `math.ceil((n - i * (i - 1)) / (i * i)) + ((n - i * (i - 1)) % (i * i) == 0)` for `i` from 1 to `m`. This formula does not correspond to the problem's requirements.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, for each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), we need to find the number of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

A correct implementation would involve:
1. Iterating over each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. For each \(b\), iterating over each \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
3. Checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the test case:
```
n = 2, m = 3
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).

The provided code will not correctly count these pairs because the logic inside `func_2` is flawed.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic for counting the valid pairs \((a, b)\) in all cases. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
