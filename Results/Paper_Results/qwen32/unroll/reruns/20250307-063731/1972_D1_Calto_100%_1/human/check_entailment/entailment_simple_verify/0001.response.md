### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program and suggests a more appropriate approach to solve the problem. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Requirements:**
   - We need to find ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Analysis of Provided Code:**
   - **Function `func_1(a, b)`:** This correctly computes the GCD of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - **Function `func_2(n, m)`:** This function attempts to count the number of valid pairs but does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem. Specifically:
     - `cnt` is initialized to `-1`, which is incorrect.
     - The calculations for `x` and `y` do not align with the problem's requirements.
     - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`, but it does not account for the actual pairs \((a, b)\) and does not use the GCD in the way required by the problem.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This is implemented in the `count_valid_pairs` function provided in the original assessment.

4. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations in the annotated version of the code describe the state of the program at key points but do not address the logical errors in `func_2`.
   - The annotations suggest that `cnt` should be the final value after the loop, but they do not explain how the loop's logic correctly counts the valid pairs.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program (`func_2`) does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
   - The original assessment correctly identifies these issues and provides a correct implementation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
