### Reasoning:

The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the provided functions:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - It is correctly implemented and returns the GCD of the two numbers.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.
   - The logic inside the loop seems to be an attempt to count valid pairs based on some mathematical transformation, but it does not directly correspond to the problem's condition.

Let's analyze the logic inside `func_2`:

- The loop iterates from `1` to `m`.
- For each `i` (which represents `b`), it calculates `x` as `n - (i * i - i)` and `y` as `i * i`.
- It then updates `cnt` with `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
  
The mathematical transformation and the logic inside the loop do not match the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided logic does not seem to correctly implement the problem's requirement.

### Verification:

To verify, let's consider the first test case from the example:
- Input: `n = 1`, `m = 1`
- Expected output: `1` (only pair is \((1, 1)\))

According to the logic in `func_2`:
- For `i = 1`, `x = 1 - (1 * 1 - 1) = 1`, `y = 1 * 1 = 1`
- `cnt` is updated by `math.ceil(1 / 1) + (1 % 1 == 0) = 1 + 1 = 2`
- However, `cnt` is initialized to `-1`, so final `cnt` would be `2 - 1 = 1`, which matches the expected output.

But let's consider another test case:
- Input: `n = 2`, `m = 3`
- Expected output: `3` (pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\))

According to the logic in `func_2`:
- For `i = 1`, `x = 2 - (1 * 1 - 1) = 2`, `y = 1 * 1 = 1`
- `cnt` is updated by `math.ceil(2 / 1) + (2 % 1 == 0) = 2 + 1 = 3`
- For `i = 2`, `x = 2 - (2 * 2 - 2) = -2`, `y = 2 * 2 = 4`
- `cnt` is updated by `math.ceil(-2 / 4) + (-2 % 4 == 0) = 0 + 0 = 0`
- For `i = 3`, `x = 2 - (3 * 3 - 3) = -6`, `y = 3 * 3 = 9`
- `cnt` is updated by `math.ceil(-6 / 9) + (-6 % 9 == 0) = 0 + 0 = 0`
- Final `cnt` would be `3 - 1 = 2`, which does not match the expected output.

### Conclusion:

The provided `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given condition. The logic inside the loop does not match the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: False**
