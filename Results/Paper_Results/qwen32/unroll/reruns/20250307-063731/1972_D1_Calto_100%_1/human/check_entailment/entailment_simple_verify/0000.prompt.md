You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #The program returns the GCD of the initial a and b, and b is 0.

        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is the final value after the loop completes, calculated as the sum of `math.ceil((n - i * (i - 1)) / (i * i)) + ((n - i * (i - 1)) % (i * i) == 0)` for `i` from 1 to `m`.
    return cnt
    #The program returns the final value of `cnt`, which is the sum of `math.ceil((n - i * (i - 1)) / (i * i)) + ((n - i * (i - 1)) % (i * i) == 0)` for `i` from 1 to `m`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the given conditions. Let's analyze the code and the problem description in detail.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).

However, the logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the problem requirements. Here are the issues:
- The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\), which is correct, but the logic inside the loop is not aligned with the problem statement.
- The calculation of `x` and `y` does not correctly determine the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, for each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), we need to find the number of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

A correct implementation would involve:
1. Iterating over each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. For each \(b\), iterating over each \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
3. Checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the test case:
```
n = 2, m = 3
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).

The provided code will not correctly count these pairs because the logic inside `func_2` is flawed.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided code does not correctly implement the logic for counting the valid pairs \((a, b)\) in all cases, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
