To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state before the for loop starts, we need to focus on the variables that are directly involved in the loop's execution. In this case, the variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`.

Here's the provided loop:
```python
for i in range(1, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The `range(1, m + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `m` (inclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 1. The variable `i` is initialized to 1 at the start of the loop; thus, we don't need to adjust `i` before the loop begins because it is set by the `range` function.

The variable `n` and `cnt` are not part of the loop head and do not directly affect the loop's execution. Therefore, we do not need to adjust them for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the only necessary adjustment is ensuring that `m` is at least 1. 

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is -1, `m` must be at least 1**
