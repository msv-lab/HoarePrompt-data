Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Provided Code:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Computes the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: Intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Function Summary:
The function summary for `func_2` states that it calculates the sum of `math.ceil((n - i * (i - 1)) / (i * i)) + ((n - i * (i - 1)) % (i * i) == 0)` for each integer `i` from 1 to `m`.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because the logic inside `func_2` does not correctly implement the problem requirements.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function correctly computes the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. It is not used in `func_2`, which is a concern.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - The function iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
   - It then updates the count `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), iterate over each \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Verification of `func_2`:
Let's verify if the logic in `func_2` aligns with the problem requirements.

- The provided function summary suggests that the function is trying to count the number of valid pairs by some formula involving `n`, `i`, and `i * i`.
- However, the formula `math.ceil((n - i * (i - 1)) / (i * i)) + ((n - i * (i - 1)) % (i * i) == 0)` does not directly correspond to checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Example Verification:
Let's consider the test case `n = 2, m = 3`:
- Valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).

Let's manually check the function `func_2`:
- For `i = 1`:
  - `x = 2 - (1 * 1 - 1) = 2`
  - `y = 1 * 1 = 1`
  - `cnt += math.ceil(2 / 1) + (2 % 1 == 0) = 2 + 1 = 3`
- For `i = 2`:
  - `x = 2 - (2 * 2 - 2) = 2 - 2 = 0`
  - `y = 2 * 2 = 4`
  - `cnt += math.ceil(0 / 4) + (0 % 4 == 0) = 0 + 1 = 1`
- For `i = 3`:
  - `x = 2 - (3 * 3 - 3) = 2 - 6 = -4`
  - `y = 3 * 3 = 9`
  - `cnt += math.ceil(-4 / 9) + (-4 % 9 == 0) = -1 + 0 = -1`

The final count `cnt` would be `3 + 1 - 1 = 3`, which is correct for this specific test case. However, this formula does not generalize to all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic for counting the valid pairs \((a, b)\) in all cases. The function `func_2` uses a formula that does not directly correspond to the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**.
