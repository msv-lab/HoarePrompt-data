### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem statement and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Code Analysis:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Computes the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: Intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).

However, the logic in `func_2` is not aligned with the problem requirements. Here's a breakdown of the issues:
- The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\), which is correct.
- The calculation of `x` and `y` does not correctly determine the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

The provided code for `func_2` is:
```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt
```
This code does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs. It seems to be using some mathematical transformation that does not match the problem requirements.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, for each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), we need to find the number of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

A correct implementation would involve:
1. Iterating over each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. For each \(b\), iterating over each \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
3. Checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the test case:
```
n = 2, m = 3
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).

The provided code will not correctly count these pairs because the logic inside `func_2` is flawed.

#### Conclusion:
Since the provided code does not correctly implement the logic for counting the valid pairs \((a, b)\) in all cases, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the given conditions.
