Functionality: **The function calculates an accumulated sum based on the formula `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` starting from 1 up to the point where `i * i` exceeds `n + i`. It then returns this accumulated sum minus one. The values of `n` and `m` are obtained from another function `func_7` and remain unchanged throughout the execution.**
