### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the provided functions and the main function `func_16`:

1. **Input Reading Functions**:
   - `func_1` reads a single integer.
   - `func_2` reads a line of space-separated integers and returns a map object.
   - `func_3` reads a line of space-separated integers and returns a list.
   - `func_4` reads `rows_number` lines of space-separated integers and returns a list of lists.
   - `func_5` reads a line and strips the newline character.
   - `func_6` reads a line, strips the newline character, and decodes it to a string.
   - `func_7` reads a line, splits it into substrings, and converts each substring to an integer, returning a list.
   - `func_8` reads `rows` lines, each containing space-separated integers, and returns a list of lists.
   - `func_9` reads a line and returns it as a string.
   - `func_10` reads a line and returns it as an integer.
   - `func_11` reads a line, splits it by whitespace, and returns a list of strings.

2. **Utility Functions**:
   - `func_12` is a recursive function that appears to be related to some graph processing or ranking but is not relevant to the problem at hand.
   - `func_13` computes the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) and coefficients.
   - `func_14` checks if the sum of differences between a list of integers and a given integer `m` is within a certain limit `k`, but it is not relevant to the problem.
   - `func_15` calculates a sum based on the formula \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for \(i\) up to \(\sqrt{n + i}\), but it does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem.

3. **Main Function**:
   - `func_16` reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calls `func_15` and prints the result.

### Analysis of `func_15`:
- `func_15` does not implement the correct logic for the problem. It calculates a sum based on the formula \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for \(i\) up to \(\sqrt{n + i}\) and returns `ans - 1`. This does not match the problem's requirement of finding pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program as a whole is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
