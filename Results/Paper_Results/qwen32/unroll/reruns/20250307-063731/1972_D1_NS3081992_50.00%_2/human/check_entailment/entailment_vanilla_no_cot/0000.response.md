Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The function `func_15` and `func_16` seem to be intended to solve the problem, but the logic within `func_15` is incorrect for the problem at hand.

The task is to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current implementation in `func_15` does not implement this logic. Instead, it seems to be calculating something related to divisors, which is not directly relevant to the problem.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the given condition. This can be optimized by leveraging properties of the gcd and the constraints given, but the current implementation does not do this.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import sys
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def count_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        m = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(count_pairs(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution iterates over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is satisfied. This is a straightforward approach and works within the given constraints.
