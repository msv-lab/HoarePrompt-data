Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers. It calculates the accumulated sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all valid iterations, where `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n + i` from the last iteration, and returns `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the accumulated sum.**
