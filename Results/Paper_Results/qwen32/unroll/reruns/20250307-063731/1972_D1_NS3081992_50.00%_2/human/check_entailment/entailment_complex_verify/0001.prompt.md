You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Mathematical Insight:
The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be expressed as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

Let's denote \(\gcd(a, b) = d\). Then we can write:
\[ a = d \cdot a_1 \]
\[ b = d \cdot b_1 \]
where \(\gcd(a_1, b_1) = 1\).

Substituting these into the condition, we get:
\[ d \cdot a_1 + d \cdot b_1 = k \cdot d \cdot b_1 \cdot d \]
\[ a_1 + b_1 = k \cdot b_1 \cdot d \]

Since \(a_1 + b_1\) is a multiple of \(b_1\), we have:
\[ a_1 = (k \cdot d - 1) \cdot b_1 \]

Thus, for each \(b\), we need to find valid \(a\) such that:
\[ a = (k \cdot d - 1) \cdot b \]
where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(\gcd(a, b) = d\).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program contains several functions, but only `func_15` and `func_16` seem relevant to the problem. Let's analyze `func_15`:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

This function calculates something based on the input `n` and `m`, but it does not seem to directly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem statement.

The main function `func_16` calls `func_15` for each test case and prints the result:
```python
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func_15` does not accurately count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
