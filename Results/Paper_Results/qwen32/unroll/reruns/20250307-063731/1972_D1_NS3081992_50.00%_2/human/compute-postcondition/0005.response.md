Output State: **The program returns `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the accumulated sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all valid iterations, and `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n + i` from the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, the program calculates the value of `ans`, which is the sum of a series of integer divisions, and then subtracts 1 from this sum before returning it.
