Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program includes several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_16`) but the core logic for solving the problem is contained in `func_15` and `func_16`. Let's analyze whether this program correctly implements the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
Given two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \), count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \( 1 \le a \le n \)
2. \( 1 \le b \le m \)
3. \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \)

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The main logic is in `func_15`:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

This function calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given pair \((n, m)\). However, the implementation does not seem to consider the second integer \( m \) at all. The logic inside `func_15` only uses \( n \) and iterates based on \( n \) and \( i \), without any reference to \( m \).

#### Why It's Incorrect:
The problem requires considering both \( n \) and \( m \). The current implementation disregards \( m \), which means it does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where both \( a \) and \( b \) must satisfy the given conditions.

#### Potential Test Case to Show Incorrectness:
Consider the input:
```
1
2 3
```
The correct output should be 3, as the valid pairs are (1,1), (1,2), and (2,1). However, the provided program will not produce the correct output because it does not account for \( m \).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not consider the second integer \( m \) in the input, which is crucial for determining the valid pairs \((a, b)\).
