Reasoning:
The given program is supposed to solve the problem of finding the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). 

The program reads multiple test cases, each containing two integers n and m. For each test case, it calls `func_15()` which calculates the number of valid pairs for that test case. The function `func_15()` iterates over possible values of i and accumulates a sum based on the formula `(n + i) // (i * i)`, then returns the accumulated sum minus one.

However, this approach does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_15()` does not account for the condition that a + b must be a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). Instead, it seems to be implementing a different logic that does not match the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to iterate over all possible values of a and b within their respective ranges and check if the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b) holds. This approach would be computationally expensive for large values of n and m, so optimizations or a different mathematical approach would be necessary to handle the problem within the given constraints.

Since the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
