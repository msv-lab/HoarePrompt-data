To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the initial conditions and the loop's logic.

Given:
- Initial State: `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0.
- Loop: 
  ```python
  while i * i <= n + i:
      ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
      i += 1
  ```

Let's break down the loop:
1. The loop continues as long as `i * i <= n + i`.
2. In each iteration, `ans` is incremented by the integer division of `(n + i)` by `(i * i)`.
3. `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.

Since the values of `n` and `m` are not specified, we can't compute exact numerical values for `ans`. However, we can describe the process and the final state in terms of `n` and `m`.

The loop will iterate until `i * i` exceeds `n + i`. In each iteration, `ans` accumulates the result of `(n + i) // (i * i)`. The value of `i` will be incremented until the loop condition fails.

Let's assume `n` and `m` are known values from `func_7()`. The loop will run for a certain number of iterations, and `ans` will be the sum of the integer divisions calculated in each iteration. The final value of `i` will be the smallest integer such that `i * i > n + i`.

Output State: **`i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n + i` from the last iteration, and `ans` is the accumulated sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all valid iterations. `n` and `m` remain unchanged.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes, `i` will be the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n + i` from the last valid iteration, and `ans` will be the total sum of the integer divisions `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all iterations where `i * i` was less than or equal to `n + i`. The values of `n` and `m` will remain the same as they were initially.
