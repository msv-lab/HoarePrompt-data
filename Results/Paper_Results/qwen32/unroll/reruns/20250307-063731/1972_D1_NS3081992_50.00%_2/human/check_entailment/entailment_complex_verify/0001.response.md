### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided program. The goal is to determine the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:

1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The original assessment suggested that the provided program is incorrect because the function `func_15` does not seem to directly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem statement. However, let's analyze `func_15` more closely, especially in the context of the mathematical insight provided.

#### Mathematical Insight Recap:
We derived that for each \(b\), we need to find valid \(a\) such that:
\[ a = (k \cdot d - 1) \cdot b \]
where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(\gcd(a, b) = d\).

This means that for each \(b\), we need to find the number of valid \(a\) that satisfy the above condition.

#### Analysis of `func_15`:
The function `func_15` is defined as follows:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

This function calculates the sum \(\sum_{i=1}^{\sqrt{n+i}} \left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\) and subtracts 1 from the result.

Let's consider the loop:
- For each \(i\), it computes \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\).
- This loop runs while \(i \cdot i \leq n + i\).

The key insight here is that this loop effectively counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) by iterating over possible values of \(i\) and summing up the number of valid \(a\) for each \(b\).

Given the problem constraints and the mathematical formulation, this approach is indeed a valid way to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Conclusion:
The provided program, specifically the function `func_15`, correctly implements the solution to the problem based on the derived mathematical insight. The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program was incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
