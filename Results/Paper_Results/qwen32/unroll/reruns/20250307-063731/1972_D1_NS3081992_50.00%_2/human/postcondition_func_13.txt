The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, the length of the list `n`, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It calculates the difference between `m` and each element in `a` that is less than `m`, subtracts these differences from `k`, and returns 1 if the resulting `k` is non-negative; otherwise, it returns -1.
