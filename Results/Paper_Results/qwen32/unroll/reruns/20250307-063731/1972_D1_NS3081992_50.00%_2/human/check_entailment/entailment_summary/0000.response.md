Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided functions to determine if the program correctly solves the problem described.

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n
2. 1 ≤ b ≤ m
3. a + b is a multiple of b \* gcd(a, b)

The main function that seems to handle the core logic is `func_15()`. However, it does not directly address the problem statement. Instead, it calculates a sum based on a different formula `(n + i) // (i * i)` for values of `i` up to the point where `i * i` exceeds `n + i`. This formula is unrelated to the problem of finding pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

The function `func_16()` is the entry point of the program. It reads the number of test cases using `func_10()` and then calls `func_15()` for each test case, printing the result.

Since `func_15()` does not implement the correct logic for solving the given problem, the entire program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
