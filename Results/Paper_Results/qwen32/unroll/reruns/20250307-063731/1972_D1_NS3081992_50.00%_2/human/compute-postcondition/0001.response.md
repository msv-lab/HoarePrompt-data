To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of the functions `func_10()` and `func_15()`. However, since these functions are not defined in the provided code snippet, we'll make some reasonable assumptions based on common practices and typical loop behaviors in such contexts.

### Assumptions:
1. **`func_10()`**: This function likely returns the number of iterations the loop should run. Since no specific behavior is given, we'll assume it returns a value that depends on the initial state variables `n` and `m`. For simplicity, let's assume `func_10()` returns `n`.
2. **`func_15()`**: This function likely returns a value that is printed in each iteration of the loop. We'll assume `func_15()` returns `m`.

### Loop Execution:
Given the assumptions:
- The loop will run `n` times because `func_10()` returns `n`.
- In each iteration, `func_15()` returns `m`, and this value is printed followed by a newline.

### Output State:
After the loop executes all its iterations, the output will be the value of `m` printed `n` times, each on a new line. The values of `n` and `m` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Output State: **The value `m` is printed `n` times, each on a new line. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.**
