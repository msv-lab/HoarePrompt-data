### Reasoning:

Let's delve into the problem and the provided program to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Mathematical Insight:
The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be expressed as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

Let's denote \(\gcd(a, b) = d\). Then we can write:
\[ a = d \cdot a_1 \]
\[ b = d \cdot b_1 \]
where \(\gcd(a_1, b_1) = 1\).

Substituting these into the condition, we get:
\[ d \cdot a_1 + d \cdot b_1 = k \cdot d \cdot b_1 \cdot d \]
\[ a_1 + b_1 = k \cdot b_1 \cdot d \]

Since \(a_1 + b_1\) is a multiple of \(b_1\), we have:
\[ a_1 = (k \cdot d - 1) \cdot b_1 \]

Thus, for each \(b\), we need to find valid \(a\) such that:
\[ a = (k \cdot d - 1) \cdot b \]
where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(\gcd(a, b) = d\).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program contains several functions, but only `func_15` and `func_16` seem relevant to the problem. Let's analyze `func_15`:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

This function calculates something based on the input `n` and `m`, but it does not seem to directly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem statement.

The main function `func_16` calls `func_15` for each test case and prints the result:
```python
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
```

#### Verification using Annotations:
Let's look at the annotated version of the code to see if we can identify any issues:

```python
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

The annotations indicate that `func_15` calculates a value based on the input `n` and `m` but does not directly address the problem of counting valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func_15` does not accurately count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
