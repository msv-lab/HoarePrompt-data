To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which in this case is `for _ in range(func_10()):`. The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a positive integer. The only state we can adjust is related to `func_10()`.

Since `func_10()` is a function call, we don't have information about its implementation. However, we need to ensure that it returns a positive integer to make the loop execute. Therefore, we must assume that `func_10()` will return a positive integer for the loop to start executing.

Given the information, the only state we can adjust is ensuring that `func_10()` returns a positive integer. Since we don't have control over the function itself, we can't directly adjust it. However, we can state that for the loop to execute, `func_10()` must return a positive integer.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` must return a positive integer**
