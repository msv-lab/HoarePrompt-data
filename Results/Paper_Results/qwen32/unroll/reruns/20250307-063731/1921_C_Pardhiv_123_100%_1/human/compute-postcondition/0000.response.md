`t` is assigned the value `int(input(''))`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`f`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `n`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `f`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `n` are unchanged.**
