Output State: **t is 0; f, a, b, m, and n are unchanged.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration until `t` is no longer greater than 0. The variables `f`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `n` will remain unchanged from their initial values, as they are not modified outside the loop body and are reassigned new values at the start of each iteration based on the input.
