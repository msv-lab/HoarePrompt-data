### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge, given the constraints. Here's a breakdown of the program and its logic:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It also reads the list of message sending moments `m`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes the list `ls` with a leading `0` (representing the initial time) followed by the list of message sending moments.
   - It iterates over each message sending moment and calculates the charge consumption.
     - The charge consumption for each message is the minimum of:
       - The energy consumed by keeping the phone on from the previous message time to the current message time (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`).
       - The energy consumed by turning the phone off and on (`b`).
     - It subtracts this minimum energy consumption from the current charge `f`.
   
3. **Output:**
   - After processing all messages for a test case, it checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than `0`.
     - If `f > 0`, it prints "YES".
     - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis:

- **Charge Calculation:**
  - The program correctly calculates the charge consumption by considering the minimum energy required between keeping the phone on for the duration or turning it off and on.
  - This ensures that the phone will not consume more energy than necessary, which is crucial for determining if Stepan can send all messages.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge cases where the phone needs to be turned off and on to save energy.
  - It also handles the scenario where the phone can send all messages without needing to turn off and on.

- **Correctness:**
  - The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and correctly implements the required checks.
  - The program efficiently processes each test case within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge.

**Correctness: True**
