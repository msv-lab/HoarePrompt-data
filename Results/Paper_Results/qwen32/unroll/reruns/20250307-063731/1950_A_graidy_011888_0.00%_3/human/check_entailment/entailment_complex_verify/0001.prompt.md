You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Annotated Code: 
from random import randint

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: i is 1001, and the values of t, a, b, and c remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates and prints 1000 sets of three random integers between 1 and 9. For each set, it determines if the middle integer is a peak (greater than the other two) or part of a stair (greater than one and less than the other), and prints the result. The input parameters `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not used in the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task requires reading input values for multiple test cases and determining whether the given triplet of digits forms a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE". However, the provided program does the following:

1. It generates random numbers between 1 and 9 for each of the three digits (x, y, z) in a loop that runs up to 1000 times.
2. It checks the conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK" but does not handle the case where a, b, and c can be equal to 0 as specified in the problem description.
3. It prints the generated random numbers and the result of the check for each iteration, which is not the expected output format.
4. It does not read any input from the user; instead, it uses randomly generated values.

Given the above points, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. It should read the number of test cases, read the digits for each test case, and then print the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
