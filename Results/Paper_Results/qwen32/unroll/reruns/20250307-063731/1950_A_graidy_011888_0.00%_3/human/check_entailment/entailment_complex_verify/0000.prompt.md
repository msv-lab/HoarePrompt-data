You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Annotated Code: 
from random import randint

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: i is 1001, and the values of t, a, b, and c remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates and prints 1000 sets of three random integers between 1 and 9. For each set, it determines if the middle integer is a peak (greater than the other two) or part of a stair (greater than one and less than the other), and prints the result. The input parameters `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not used in the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description. The task is to determine whether the given digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the input values for each test case. However, the provided program generates random numbers and checks them, which does not align with the problem's requirement to process specific input values.

The program should read the number of test cases and then process each test case individually, checking the conditions for "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" and printing the appropriate result. Instead, it generates random numbers and prints them along with a result that does not correspond to the input values.

Here is a corrected version of the program that follows the problem description:

```python
def determine_shape(a, b, c):
    if a < b < c:
        return "STAIR"
    elif a < b > c:
        return "PEAK"
    else:
        return "NONE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(data[index])
        b = int(data[index + 1])
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        result = determine_shape(a, b, c)
        results.append(result)
        index += 3
    print("\n".join(results))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct result based on the given conditions.
