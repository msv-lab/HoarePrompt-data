Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n`, a list `a` of `n` distinct integers in increasing order, an integer `m`, and `m` queries. Each query consists of two integers `x` and `y`. The function processes each query and returns the result for each query based on the provided inputs.**
