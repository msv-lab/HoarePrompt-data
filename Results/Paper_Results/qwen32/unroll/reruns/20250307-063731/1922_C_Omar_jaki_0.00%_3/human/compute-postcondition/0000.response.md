The given code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line of input, splits it into multiple strings, converts each string to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. This lambda function does not modify any existing variables directly and does not return a value in the traditional sense (it returns a map object which can be iterated over).

Given the initial state, the only change is the introduction of the lambda function `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and for each query, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= n and x != y. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `r` is a lambda function that reads and returns a map of integers from the input.**
