Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, read from the input using the lambda function `r`. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and for each query, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= n and x != y. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `r` is a lambda function that reads and returns a map of integers from the input.**

In simple terms, the variable `t` has been assigned the value read from the input using the lambda function `r`, while all other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, `x`, `y`) and their constraints remain as initially described.
