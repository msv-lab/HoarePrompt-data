The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, which represents the number of test cases. The value of `t` is not directly used in the provided code snippet, but `num_tests` will hold the value of `t` after the input is read.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is equal to `t`.**
