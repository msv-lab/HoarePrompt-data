Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, the first line contains the number of signs, `n`.
   - The second line contains `n` integers, `a_i`, representing the periodicity of each sign.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program should output the year in which the n-th sign occurs, which is also the year of the apocalypse.

3. **Logic:**
   - The first sign occurs in the first multiple of `a_1` that is greater than or equal to year 0.
   - The second sign occurs in the first multiple of `a_2` that is greater than the year the first sign occurred.
   - This process continues until the n-th sign.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows a straightforward approach to solve the problem:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs and their respective periodicities.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year as the smallest multiple of `a_i` that is greater than `start_year`.
   - It updates `start_year` to this new year.
   - This process is repeated for all signs.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the final `start_year`, which is the year the n-th sign occurs.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - `start_year` starts at 0.
   - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
   - Second sign: `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
   - Third sign: `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
   - Fourth sign: `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
   - Fifth sign: `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
   - Sixth sign: `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (matches the expected result)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - `start_year` starts at 0.
   - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
   - Second sign: `start_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
   - Third sign: `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
   - Fourth sign: `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
   - Fifth sign: `start_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
   - Output: `5` (matches the expected result)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - `start_year` starts at 0.
   - All signs occur in the first year.
   - Output: `5` (matches the expected result)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
   - `start_year` starts at 0.
   - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
   - Second sign: `start_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
   - Third sign: `start_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
   - Fourth sign: `start_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 900`
   - Fifth sign: `start_year = (900 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
   - Sixth sign: `start_year = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
   - Output: `2012` (matches the expected result)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case based on the provided input and matches the expected output for all the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
