### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur based on the periodicity of each sign. Let's break down the logic of the program and verify if it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Logic to Determine the Year of the n-th Sign:**
   - The program initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by finding the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is strictly greater than `start_year`.
   - This is achieved by the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which calculates the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the year of the n-th sign.

### Verification:

Let's verify the correctness of the program using the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - Calculation:
     - `start_year` starts at 0.
     - After first sign: `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
     - After second sign: `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
     - After third sign: `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
     - After fourth sign: `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
     - After fifth sign: `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
     - After sixth sign: `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (matches the expected result)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Calculation:
     - `start_year` starts at 0.
     - After first sign: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
     - After second sign: `start_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
     - After third sign: `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
     - After fourth sign: `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
     - After fifth sign: `start_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
   - Output: `5` (matches the expected result)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Calculation:
     - `start_year` starts at 0.
     - After first sign: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
     - After second sign: `start_year = (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
     - After third sign: `start_year = (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
     - After fourth sign: `start_year = (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
     - After fifth sign: `start_year = (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`
   - Output: `5` (matches the expected result)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 6`, `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
   - Calculation:
     - `start_year` starts at 0.
     - After first sign: `start_year = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
     - After second sign: `start_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
     - After third sign: `start_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
     - After fourth sign: `start_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 900`
     - After fifth sign: `start_year = (900 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
     - After sixth sign: `start_year = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
   - Output: `2012` (matches the expected result)
