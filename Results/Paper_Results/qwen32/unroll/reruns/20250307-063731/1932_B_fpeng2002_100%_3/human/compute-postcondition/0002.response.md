To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the given loop and its operations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The initial state tells us that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. `num_tests` is set to the value of `t`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `num_tests` times, decrementing `num_tests` by 1 in each iteration.
   - In each iteration, the loop reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`.
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - It then iterates over each number `x` in the `nums` list, updating `start_year` using the formula:
     \[
     \text{start_year} = (\text{start_year} // \text{nums}[x] + 1) * \text{nums}[x]
     \]
   - After processing all numbers in `nums`, it prints the final value of `start_year`.

3. **Output State**:
   - After all iterations, `num_tests` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
   - The variables `n`, `nums`, and `start_year` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, but they are not retained outside the loop after it finishes.
   - The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution.

Thus, the output state after the loop completes all iterations is:
- `num_tests` will be 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`, `start_year`) will be in their state after the last iteration of the loop, but only `num_tests` is guaranteed to be part of the output state as per the loop head and body.

Output State: **num_tests is 0.**
