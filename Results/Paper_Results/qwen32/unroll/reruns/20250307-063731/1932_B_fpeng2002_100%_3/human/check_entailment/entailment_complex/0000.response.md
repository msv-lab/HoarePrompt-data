Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem by calculating the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case. The core of the solution lies in the loop where `start_year` is updated for each sign. 

For each sign `x` in the list `nums`:
- `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that `start_year` is updated to the next occurrence of the current sign after the previous sign has occurred. This is done by:
  - Dividing `start_year` by `nums[x]` to see how many cycles of `nums[x]` have passed up to `start_year`.
  - Adding 1 to move to the next cycle.
  - Multiplying by `nums[x]` to get the actual year of the next occurrence.

This process is repeated for each sign, ensuring that the occurrence of each subsequent sign follows the previous one strictly.

The annotated explanation provided matches the intended behavior of the code. The code correctly implements the logic to find the year for each test case when all signs will have occurred sequentially.

Correctness: **True**
