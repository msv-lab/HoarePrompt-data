You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]

        print(start_year)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, the first line contains the number of signs, `n`.
   - The second line contains `n` integers, `a_i`, representing the periodicity of each sign.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program should output the year in which the n-th sign occurs, which is also the year of the apocalypse.

3. **Logic:**
   - The first sign occurs in the first multiple of `a_1` that is greater than or equal to year 0.
   - The second sign occurs in the first multiple of `a_2` that is greater than the year the first sign occurred.
   - This process continues until the n-th sign.

### Program Analysis:
The program follows a straightforward approach to solve the problem:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs and their respective periodicities.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year as the smallest multiple of `a_i` that is greater than `start_year`.
   - It updates `start_year` to this new year.
   - This process is repeated for all signs.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the final `start_year`, which is the year the n-th sign occurs.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - `start_year` starts at 0.
   - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
   - Second sign: `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
   - Third sign: `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
   - Fourth sign: `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
   - Fifth sign: `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
   - Sixth sign: `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (matches the expected result)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - `start_year` starts at 0.
   - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
   - Second sign: `start_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
   - Third sign: `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
   - Fourth sign: `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
   - Fifth sign: `start_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
   - Output: `5` (matches the expected result)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - `start_year` starts at 0.
   - All signs occur in the first year.
   - Output: `5` (matches the expected result)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
   - `start_year` starts at 0.
   - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
   - Second sign: `start_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
   - Third sign: `start_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
   - Fourth sign: `start_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 900`
   - Fifth sign: `start_year = (900 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
   - Sixth sign: `start_year = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
   - Output: `2012` (matches the expected result)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case based on the provided input and matches the expected output for all the given examples.
