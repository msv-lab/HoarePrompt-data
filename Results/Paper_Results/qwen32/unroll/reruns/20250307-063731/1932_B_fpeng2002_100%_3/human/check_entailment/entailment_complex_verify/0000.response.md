### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to determine if the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- The Chaya tribe waits for signs to occur sequentially.
- Each sign occurs periodically every `a_i` years.
- The program must determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given the periodicities of each sign.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_i`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `start_year` is initialized to 0, representing the base year from which signs start occurring.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign**:
   - For each sign, the program calculates the next occurrence year using the formula: `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
   - This formula finds the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`:
     - `start_year // nums[x]` computes how many full cycles of `nums[x]` have passed since `start_year`.
     - Adding 1 ensures we move to the next cycle.
     - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the exact year when the next sign will occur.
   - `start_year` is updated to this new year, ensuring the next sign occurs after the current one.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program outputs the `start_year`, which is the year when the n-th sign occurs.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the program reads input correctly and initializes `start_year` to 0.
- For each sign, it correctly calculates the next occurrence year using the formula and updates `start_year`.
- Finally, it prints the `start_year` for each test case.

#### Example Validation:
Let's validate the program with the provided example:
- **First Test Case**:
  - Signs: `3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18`
  - Calculations:
    - Start at year 0.
    - First sign: `(0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
    - Second sign: `(3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
    - Third sign: `(4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
    - Fourth sign: `(8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
    - Fifth sign: `(10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
    - Sixth sign: `(18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
  - The output is `36`, which matches the expected result.

- **Second Test Case**:
  - Signs: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`
  - Calculations:
    - Start at year 0.
    - First sign: `(0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
    - Second sign: `(1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
    - Third sign: `(2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
    - Fourth sign: `(3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
    - Fifth sign: `(4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
  - The output is `5`, which matches the expected result.

- **Third Test Case**:
  - Signs: `1, 1, 1, 1, 1`
  - Calculations:
    - Start at year 0.
    - Each sign occurs every year starting from 1.
    - The output is `5`, which matches the expected result.

- **Fourth Test Case**:
  - Signs: `50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006`
  - Calculations:
    - Start at year 0.
    - Follow the formula for each sign.
    - The output is `2012`, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles the example cases accurately. The annotations confirm that the program's behavior aligns with the expected logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
