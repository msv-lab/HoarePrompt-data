To determine the necessary modifications to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the variables involved in the loop condition. In this case, the loop condition is `num_tests > 0`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `num_tests` is equal to `t`.

Since `num_tests` is equal to `t`, and `t` is guaranteed to be in the range 1 to 1000, `num_tests` will also be in the range 1 to 1000. This means `num_tests > 0` will always be true, and the loop can certainly execute one time.

Therefore, no adjustment to the state is necessary because the condition `num_tests > 0` is already satisfied by the given constraints.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is equal to `t`**
