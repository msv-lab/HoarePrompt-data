Reasoning:  
The given program is designed to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur according to the rules specified in the problem description. The program iteratively calculates the next occurrence of each sign based on the occurrence of the previous sign. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`num_tests`).
2. **Loop through Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the list of their periodicities (`nums`).
3. **Calculate Occurrence Year**:
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0, representing the starting year for the first sign.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by finding the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than the `start_year`. This is achieved by the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
   - This formula ensures that the next occurrence is strictly after the `start_year` and adheres to the periodicity of the current sign.
4. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the `start_year`, which represents the year the n-th sign occurs.

The execution summary provided states that the function calculates and prints the smallest common multiple of all integers in the list, starting from a base year of 0. However, the program does not compute the least common multiple (LCM) of all the numbers in the list. Instead, it calculates the year for each sign sequentially based on the occurrence of the previous sign, which is exactly what the problem requires.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
