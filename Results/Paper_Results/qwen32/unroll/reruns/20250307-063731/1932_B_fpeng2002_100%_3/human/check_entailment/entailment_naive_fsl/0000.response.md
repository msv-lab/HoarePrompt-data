Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_i`.

2. **Initialization**: For each test case, the `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the year in which the last sign occurred.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign**:
   - For each sign, the program calculates the next occurrence year by first determining how many full cycles of `nums[x]` have passed since `start_year`.
   - `(start_year // nums[x] + 1)` computes the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`.
   - Multiplying this by `nums[x]` gives the exact year when the next sign will occur.
   - The `start_year` is then updated to this new year.

4. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, the program outputs the `start_year`, which is the year when the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

The logic ensures that the signs occur sequentially and adheres to their respective periodicities. The program correctly handles the constraints provided (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, and there are no edge cases that it fails to handle.
