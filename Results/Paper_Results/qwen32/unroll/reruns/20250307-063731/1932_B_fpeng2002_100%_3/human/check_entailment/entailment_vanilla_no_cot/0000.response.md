Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of signs, `n`.
   - It reads the list of periodicities of the signs, `nums`.
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the starting year for the first sign.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by finding the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than the `start_year`. This is done by the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
   - It updates `start_year` to this new occurrence year.
3. After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the final `start_year`, which is the year the n-th sign occurs.

The logic correctly handles the sequential nature of the signs' occurrences as described in the problem statement, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. Therefore, the program is correct.
