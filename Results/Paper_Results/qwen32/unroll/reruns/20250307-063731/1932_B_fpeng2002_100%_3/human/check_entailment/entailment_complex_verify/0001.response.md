### Reasoning:
The original assessment appears to be accurate based on the provided problem description, program code, and annotated version. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given that each sign must occur sequentially, with each subsequent sign starting to be considered from the year the previous sign occurred plus one.
   - The periodicity of each sign is given by the list of integers `a_i`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - It then iterates through each sign's periodicity, updating `start_year` to the next multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than the current `start_year`.
   - The final `start_year` after processing all signs is printed as the year the n-th sign occurs.

3. **Verification with Examples:**
   - The original assessment provided a detailed verification for each of the four test cases in the example, showing that the program correctly computes the year for each case.
   - The calculations match the expected results for all test cases.

4. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, confirming that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The annotations indicate that the program correctly calculates the smallest multiple of each `a_i` that is greater than the current `start_year`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and the original assessment accurately verifies this correctness using the provided examples. There are no discrepancies between the problem requirements, the program code, and the verification results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
