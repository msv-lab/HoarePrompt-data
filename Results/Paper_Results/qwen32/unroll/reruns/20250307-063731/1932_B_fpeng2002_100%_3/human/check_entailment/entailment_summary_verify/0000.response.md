Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Description Recap
The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that:
- The i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years.
- Signs must occur sequentially, meaning the (i+1)-th sign can only occur after the i-th sign has occurred.

### Provided Program
```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

### Function Summary Recap
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the smallest common multiple of all integers in the list, starting from a base year of 0.

### Analysis of the Program
The provided program does not actually compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods. Instead, it calculates the next occurrence of each sign sequentially.

1. **Initialization**: `start_year` is initialized to 0.
2. **Loop Through Signs**:
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by finding the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.
   - `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` computes the next occurrence of the sign.
   - `start_year` is then updated to this new occurrence year.
3. **Output**: The final `start_year` is printed, which represents the year the n-th sign occurs.

### Verification Against Problem Description
The logic in the program aligns with the problem description:
- It ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
- It correctly calculates the next occurrence year for each sign based on its periodicity.

### Verification Against Function Summary
The function summary is misleading. The program does not compute the LCM of all integers in the list. Instead, it calculates the next occurrence year for each sign sequentially.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate in terms of the program's behavior and correctness according to the problem description. The program correctly implements the logic to find the year the n-th sign occurs, ensuring sequential occurrences based on the given periodicities.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
