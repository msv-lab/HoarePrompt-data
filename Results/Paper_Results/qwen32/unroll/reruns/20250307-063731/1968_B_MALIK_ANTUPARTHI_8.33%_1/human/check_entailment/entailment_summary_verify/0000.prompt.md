You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        for j in range(b):
            if d[j] in e[k:]:
                k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
                if k == c or j == b - 1:
                    k = j + 1
                    break
            else:
                k = j
                break
        print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively. It then processes these inputs to find and print a specific index `k` for each test case. The value of `k` is determined based on the presence of characters from string `a` in string `b` under certain conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description.

1. **Indexing and Slicing Errors**:
   - The code uses `e.index(d[j])`, which will always search from the start of `e`, not from the current position `k`. This can lead to incorrect results if the character `d[j]` appears earlier in `e` but not after the current position `k`.
   - The logic for updating `k` is incorrect. The line `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1` does not take into account the current position `k` in `e`.

2. **Loop and Condition Errors**:
   - The loop `for j in range(b)` iterates over the length of string `a`. However, the condition `if k == c or j == b - 1` is incorrect. The condition `k == c` is not meaningful because `k` should not exceed the length of `b`. Instead, the condition should check if `k` has reached the end of `b`.
   - The line `if k == c or j == b - 1:` is followed by `k = j + 1` and `break`, which is incorrect. This logic does not ensure that the maximum `k` is found.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle the case where `a` is longer than `b` correctly. It should return `0` if `a` is longer than `b` and no characters match.
   - The code does not handle the case where `a` is empty or `b` is empty correctly.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 3
100
110
```
The correct output should be `2` because the prefix `10` of `a` is a subsequence of `b`. However, the provided code will incorrectly output `0` because of the incorrect indexing and logic.

### Corrected Code Example:
Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        j = 0
        while j < b and k < c:
            if d[j] == e[k]:
                j += 1
            k += 1
        print(j)

func()
```

This corrected code correctly finds the maximum `k` such that the first `k` characters of `a` form a subsequence of `b`.
