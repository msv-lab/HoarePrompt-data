t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. The sum of all n values over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all m values over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. a and b are binary strings of lengths n and m, respectively.
