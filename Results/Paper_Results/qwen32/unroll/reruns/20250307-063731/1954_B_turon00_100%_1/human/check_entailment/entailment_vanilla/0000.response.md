Let's analyze the problem and the given solution step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem defines a "beautiful" array as one where, using a specific operation, all elements can be made the same. The operation allows us to replace an element `a[i]` with `a[i-1]` if `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`. We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. If it's impossible to make the array not beautiful, we should return -1.

### Key Observations:
1. **Identical Elements**: If the array consists of identical elements, it is impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements, as the operation can always be applied to make all elements the same.
2. **Segments of Identical Elements**: The solution attempts to find segments of identical elements and calculates the minimum length of these segments (excluding the case where the segment is the entire array). Removing elements from the shortest segment (other than the whole array) can potentially make the array not beautiful.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: If the array has only one element, it is trivially beautiful and cannot be made not beautiful by removing elements.
   - **Array with All Elements Identical**: As discussed, this case should return -1.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution attempts to find the shortest segment of identical elements in the array and uses that as the answer. However, there are a few issues with this approach:
1. **Handling Segments**: The solution correctly identifies segments of identical elements and keeps track of the minimum length of such segments.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: The solution correctly identifies the edge cases where the array is either a single element or consists of all identical elements.
3. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic to determine if the array can be made not beautiful by removing elements from the shortest segment is flawed. The solution does not account for the possibility that removing elements from longer segments might be necessary to break the "beauty" condition.

### Correctness:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases. For example, consider an array like `[1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1]`. The shortest segment of identical elements is `1` or `2` (length 1), but removing one element from these segments does not make the array not beautiful. Instead, we need to consider longer segments and how removing elements from them can break the "beauty" condition.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the solution is not correct for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
