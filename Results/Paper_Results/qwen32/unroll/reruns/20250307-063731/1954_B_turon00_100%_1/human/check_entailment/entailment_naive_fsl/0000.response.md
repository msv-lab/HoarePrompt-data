Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. The logic in the code seems to be flawed and does not handle all cases correctly.

Let's analyze the code:

1. The code iterates through the array and counts consecutive elements that are the same.
2. It keeps track of the minimum count of such consecutive elements.
3. If the minimum count is the length of the array or the array length is 1, it returns -1.
4. Otherwise, it returns the minimum count.

However, this approach does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

The correct answer should be 2, because removing the elements at indices 2 and 4 (0-based indexing) results in the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful. However, the provided code will return 1, which is incorrect.

The code fails to consider the correct logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove. It should check for segments of the array that can be collapsed using the given operation and determine the minimum removals required to disrupt such segments.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.
