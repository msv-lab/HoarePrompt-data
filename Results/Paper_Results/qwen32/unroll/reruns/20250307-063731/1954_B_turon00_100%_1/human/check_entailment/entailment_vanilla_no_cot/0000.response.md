Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove for the array to stop being beautiful. The logic in the code is flawed and does not account for the correct conditions to make the array non-beautiful. Specifically, it does not properly handle cases where the array could still be made beautiful by removing certain elements, and it incorrectly calculates the minimum number of elements to remove.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find the longest subsequence of the array where each element (except possibly the first and last) can be replaced by its neighbors. The minimum number of elements to remove would then be the total number of elements minus the length of this longest subsequence. If the entire array is such a subsequence, then it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, and the answer should be -1.
