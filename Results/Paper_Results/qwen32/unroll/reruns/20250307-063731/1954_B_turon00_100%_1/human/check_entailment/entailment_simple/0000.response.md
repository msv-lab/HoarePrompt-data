Reasoning: The program is intended to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. The logic used in the program is incorrect for this purpose. The program essentially calculates the minimum length of contiguous subarrays of the same value and outputs that value unless the array is either a single element or all elements are the same. However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of removals to make the array non-beautiful, which involves a different approach.

The program does not correctly address the requirement to make the array non-beautiful. It does not consider the structure of the array and the operations allowed to make it beautiful. For instance, it should check if there are segments of the array that, if removed, would prevent the array from being transformed into a uniform array using the allowed operations. The current approach does not account for this requirement.

Thus, the program does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
