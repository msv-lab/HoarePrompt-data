You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

    #State: For each test case, the output will be the minimum length of any contiguous subarray in `a` that contains all elements of the same value, unless the array `a` consists of a single element or all elements in `a` are the same, in which case the output will be -1. The variable `t` will remain unchanged, and the variables `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` will not retain their values as they are local to each iteration of the outer loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given solution step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem defines a "beautiful" array as one where, using a specific operation, all elements can be made the same. The operation allows us to replace an element `a[i]` with `a[i-1]` if `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`. We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. If it's impossible to make the array not beautiful, we should return -1.

### Key Observations:
1. **Identical Elements**: If the array consists of identical elements, it is impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements, as the operation can always be applied to make all elements the same.
2. **Segments of Identical Elements**: The solution attempts to find segments of identical elements and calculates the minimum length of these segments (excluding the case where the segment is the entire array). Removing elements from the shortest segment (other than the whole array) can potentially make the array not beautiful.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: If the array has only one element, it is trivially beautiful and cannot be made not beautiful by removing elements.
   - **Array with All Elements Identical**: As discussed, this case should return -1.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution attempts to find the shortest segment of identical elements in the array and uses that as the answer. However, there are a few issues with this approach:
1. **Handling Segments**: The solution correctly identifies segments of identical elements and keeps track of the minimum length of such segments.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: The solution correctly identifies the edge cases where the array is either a single element or consists of all identical elements.
3. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic to determine if the array can be made not beautiful by removing elements from the shortest segment is flawed. The solution does not account for the possibility that removing elements from longer segments might be necessary to break the "beauty" condition.

### Correctness:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases. For example, consider an array like `[1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1]`. The shortest segment of identical elements is `1` or `2` (length 1), but removing one element from these segments does not make the array not beautiful. Instead, we need to consider longer segments and how removing elements from them can break the "beauty" condition.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the solution is not correct for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
