Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by finding the minimum length of any contiguous subarray within the array `a` that contains all elements of the same value. If the array consists of a single element or all elements are the same, it returns -1.

#### Key Points in the Program:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and `cnt` to count the length of contiguous subarrays of the same element.
2. **Iteration**: It iterates through the array, updating `cnt` when the current element is the same as `tmp`. When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, then resets `cnt` and updates `tmp`.
3. **Final Update**: After the loop, it performs a final update of `ans` to ensure the last contiguous subarray is considered.
4. **Output**: If the array has only one element or if all elements are the same (`ans == n`), it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs `ans`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The program does not correctly address the problem. The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, not the minimum length of contiguous subarrays of the same element.

#### Issues:
- **Incorrect Approach**: The program's logic for finding the minimum length of contiguous subarrays of the same element does not help in determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
- **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one element or all elements are the same, but it fails for other cases.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It needs a different approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

**Correctness: False**
