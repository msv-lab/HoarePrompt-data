### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]` and replacing `a[i]` with `a[i-1]`.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Single Element Array**: If the array has only one element, it is trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. Hence, the answer is `-1`.
2. **Uniform Array**: If all elements in the array are the same, it is also trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. Hence, the answer is `-1`.
3. **Non-Uniform Array**: For arrays with different elements, the goal is to find the smallest contiguous subarray of uniform elements that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

#### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through each test case and processes the array `a` as follows:
1. It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and `cnt` to count the length of contiguous subarrays of uniform elements.
2. It iterates through the array, updating `cnt` when the current element matches `tmp`.
3. When it encounters a different element:
   - It updates `ans` with the minimum length of the contiguous subarray found so far (`min(ans, cnt)`).
   - It resets `cnt` to 0 and updates `tmp` to the current element.
4. After the loop, it performs a final check to update `ans` with the length of the last contiguous subarray.
5. If the array length `n` is 1 or `ans` equals `n` (meaning all elements were the same), it prints `-1`.
6. Otherwise, it prints `ans`, which represents the minimum length of a contiguous subarray that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

#### Verification:
- The program correctly identifies single-element arrays and uniform arrays, outputting `-1` as expected.
- For non-uniform arrays, it correctly identifies the smallest contiguous subarray of uniform elements that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output based on the provided examples and the described behavior.
