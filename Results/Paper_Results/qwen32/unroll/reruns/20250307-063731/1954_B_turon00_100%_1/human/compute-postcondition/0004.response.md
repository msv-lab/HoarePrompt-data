Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the minimum length of any contiguous subarray within `a` that contains all elements of the same value. If the array consists of a single element or all elements are the same, it returns -1. The function outputs the result for each test case.**
