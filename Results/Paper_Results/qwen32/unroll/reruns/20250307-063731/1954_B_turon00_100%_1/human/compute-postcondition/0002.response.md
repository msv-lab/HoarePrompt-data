Output State: **For each test case, the output will be the minimum length of any contiguous subarray in `a` that contains all elements of the same value, unless the array `a` consists of a single element or all elements in `a` are the same, in which case the output will be -1. The variable `t` will remain unchanged, and the variables `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` will not retain their values as they are local to each iteration of the outer loop.**
