### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided solution based on the function summary and the original assessment.

#### Problem Recap:
- An array is "beautiful" if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
- We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. If it's impossible, return -1.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Identical Elements**: If all elements are the same, the array is beautiful and cannot be made not beautiful by removing elements.
2. **Single Element**: An array with a single element is trivially beautiful and cannot be made not beautiful.
3. **Segments of Identical Elements**: The solution attempts to find the shortest segment of identical elements and uses that as the answer. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for the overall structure of the array and the interactions between different segments.

#### Function Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the minimum length of any contiguous subarray within `a` that contains all elements of the same value. If the array consists of a single element or all elements are the same, it returns -1. The function outputs the result for each test case.

#### Analysis of the Provided Solution:
- The solution iterates through the array to find segments of identical elements.
- It keeps track of the minimum length of these segments.
- If the array has only one element or all elements are the same, it correctly returns -1.
- However, the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful is flawed. The solution does not consider the interactions between different segments and the overall structure of the array.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- **Test Case 1**: `[2, 2, 2]`
  - All elements are the same, so the output is correctly `-1`.
- **Test Case 2**: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`
  - The shortest segment of identical elements is `1` or `2` (length 1). Removing one element from these segments does not make the array not beautiful. The correct approach would be to consider the structure of the array and realize that removing one element (e.g., the middle `2`) makes the array not beautiful.
- **Test Case 3**: `[1]`
  - The array has only one element, so the output is correctly `-1`.
- **Test Case 4**: `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`
  - The shortest segment of identical elements is `5` (length 1). Removing one element from these segments does not make the array not beautiful. The correct approach would be to consider the structure of the array and realize that removing the first three `3`s makes the array not beautiful.

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases. It fails to account for the interactions between different segments and the overall structure of the array, leading to incorrect results in many scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
