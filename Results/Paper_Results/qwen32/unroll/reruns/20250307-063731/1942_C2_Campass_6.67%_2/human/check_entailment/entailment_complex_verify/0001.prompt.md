You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #State: 
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `cons` based on the given integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. The value `cons` represents a specific constraint or condition derived from the input parameters.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing up to `y` additional vertices from a regular polygon with `n` sides, given that `x` vertices have already been chosen.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a list of `x` vertices.
   
2. **Sorting and Adjusting Vertices:**
   - The list of vertices is sorted.
   - An additional vertex `n + l[0]` is appended to handle the circular nature of the polygon.
   
3. **Calculating Gaps:**
   - The program calculates the gaps between consecutive vertices and stores them in the list `val`.
   - If the gap is 1, it increments `sx` (which seems to count the number of adjacent vertices).

4. **Sorting Gaps:**
   - The gaps are sorted based on a custom key: first by whether the gap is odd or even, and then by the gap value itself.

5. **Processing Gaps:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted gaps and attempts to use the available `y` vertices to reduce the gaps.
   - For each gap, it calculates how many vertices are needed to reduce the gap to form triangles (`c = i // 2`).
   - If `y` is less than `c`, it adds `y * 2` to `sx` and breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it adds the gap value to `sx` and reduces `y` by `c`.

6. **Calculating the Result:**
   - The final number of triangles is calculated as `x + sx - 2`.
   - This result is capped at `n - 2` to ensure it does not exceed the maximum possible number of triangles in the polygon.

### Evaluation:
- The program correctly handles the circular nature of the polygon by appending `n + l[0]` to the list of vertices.
- The sorting and processing of gaps seem to be aimed at maximizing the number of triangles by strategically using the available `y` vertices.
- The final calculation of the number of triangles appears to be correct based on the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is likely correct.

Correctness: **True**
