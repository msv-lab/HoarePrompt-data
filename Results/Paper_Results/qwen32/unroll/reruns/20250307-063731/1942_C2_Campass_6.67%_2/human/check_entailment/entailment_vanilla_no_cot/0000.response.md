Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem's requirements for maximizing the number of triangular pieces of cake. Here are some key issues:

1. **Triangle Counting Logic**: The program attempts to count triangles by adding `c // 2` to `sx` for each gap `c` between chosen vertices, which does not accurately reflect the number of triangles that can be formed. The logic should consider how many triangles can be formed with the addition of new vertices.

2. **Sorting Gaps**: The program sorts gaps based on a specific lambda function `(1 - x & 1, x)`, which does not align with a strategy to maximize triangles. Instead, a more strategic approach to choosing which gaps to fill with new vertices is needed.

3. **Adding New Vertices**: The program does not correctly simulate the process of adding new vertices to maximize triangles. It should consider the best positions to add vertices to form the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles.

4. **Final Calculation**: The final calculation of `cons` as `x + sx - 2` and then taking the minimum with `n - 2` does not correctly represent the maximum number of triangles that can be formed.

To correctly solve this problem, a more strategic approach is needed to determine the optimal placement of new vertices to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles. The program should consider the gaps between chosen vertices, sort them, and then strategically add new vertices to these gaps to maximize triangle formation.
