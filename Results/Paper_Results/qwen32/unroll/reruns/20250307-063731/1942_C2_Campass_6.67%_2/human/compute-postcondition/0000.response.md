The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer. This function does not directly affect the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or the list of vertices Bessie has chosen. It merely prepares a way to read input more conveniently in subsequent code.

Given the initial state, no specific values for `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or the list of vertices have been provided yet, and the lambda function `R` does not alter these values. The lambda function `R` will be used to read input in future steps, but it does not change any existing variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.**
