The `while` loop in the given code is `while t:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `t` is not zero. To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4

Since `t` is already constrained to be between 1 and 10^4, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.**
