The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer within the range 1 to 5 · 10^4. After executing the code, `t` will hold the value of the integer input, which is still within the specified range. The other variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not mentioned in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input value between 1 and 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
