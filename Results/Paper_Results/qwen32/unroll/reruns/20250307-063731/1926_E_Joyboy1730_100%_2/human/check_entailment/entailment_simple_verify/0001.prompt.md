You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to simulate the process of laying down cards based on specific rules:
1. Lay down all odd-numbered cards in ascending order.
2. Lay down all cards that are twice an odd number in ascending order.
3. Lay down all cards that are three times an odd number in ascending order, and so on.
4. This process continues until all cards are laid down.
5. For each test case, we need to determine which card is laid down at position `k`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, reading `n` (the number of cards) and `k` (the position of the card to find).
3. Creating a list `L` to store the count of cards laid down in each step.
4. Using a while loop to compute the counts of cards laid down in each step:
   - `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd-numbered cards left.
   - `n` is reduced by `m` to account for the cards that have been laid down.
   - `m` is appended to the list `L`.
5. Initializing `tot` to 0 and `pow` to 1. These variables are used to keep track of the total number of cards laid down so far and the current multiplier (1 for odd numbers, 2 for twice odd numbers, etc.).
6. Iterating over the list `L` to find the correct card at position `k`:
   - If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the k-th card is calculated as `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - `tot` is incremented by `a` to account for the cards laid down in the current step.
   - `pow` is multiplied by 2 to move to the next multiplier.

### Correctness Verification:
Let's verify if the logic in the program matches the problem requirements:
1. The calculation of `m` as `(n + 1) // 2` correctly gives the number of odd-numbered cards left.
2. The while loop correctly reduces `n` and appends the count of odd-numbered cards to `L` until all cards are laid down.
3. The loop over `L` correctly identifies the step in which the k-th card is laid down and calculates its value using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
4. The program correctly handles the multipliers for each step by doubling `pow` after each iteration.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card laid down according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
