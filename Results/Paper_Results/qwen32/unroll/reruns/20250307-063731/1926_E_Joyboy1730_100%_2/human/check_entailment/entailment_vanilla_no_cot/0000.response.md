Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program attempts to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav, but it does so in an incorrect manner. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Logic for Card Placement**: The logic for placing cards in the sequence as described in the problem is not accurately implemented. The program seems to be trying to calculate the sequence by breaking down the problem into parts, but the sequence generation is flawed.

2. **Handling of Odd and Multiples**: The program does not explicitly handle the odd numbers first, followed by multiples of 2, 3, 4, etc., as described. Instead, it seems to be using a more complex approach that does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Loop and Calculation**: The loop and calculations within the loop are not reflecting the correct sequence of card placements. For example, the calculation `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` does not correctly determine the k-th card in the sequence.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to explicitly generate the sequence as described and then determine the k-th card. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_kth_card(n, k):
    odd_cards = [i for i in range(1, n + 1, 2)]
    multiple = 2
    while len(odd_cards) < k:
        next_cards = [multiple * i for i in range(1, n // multiple + 1, 2) if multiple * i not in odd_cards]
        odd_cards.extend(next_cards)
        multiple += 1
    return odd_cards[k - 1]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(find_kth_card(n, k))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version generates the sequence as described in the problem and then finds the k-th card in that sequence.
