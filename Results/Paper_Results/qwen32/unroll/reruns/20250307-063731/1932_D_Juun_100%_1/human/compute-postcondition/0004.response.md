The code snippet initializes a dictionary `suits` with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and assigns `None` to each key. This dictionary is used to store values related to each suit, but in this code snippet, no values are assigned to the dictionary yet.

Given that the code does not modify any other variables and only initializes a new dictionary, the output state will reflect this initialization while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", and `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is one of "23456789" and the second character is one of "CDHS"; `trump` is the character input by the user; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is an empty list; `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values None.**
