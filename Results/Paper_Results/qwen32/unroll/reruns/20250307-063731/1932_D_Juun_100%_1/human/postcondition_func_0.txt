The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a set of cards and a trump suit. For each test case, it evaluates the cards, pairing non-trump cards of the same suit and using trump cards to pair any unmatched non-trump cards. It prints all pairs of cards, ensuring that trump cards are used optimally to match any unmatched cards. If there are unmatched cards and no trump cards available to pair them, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
