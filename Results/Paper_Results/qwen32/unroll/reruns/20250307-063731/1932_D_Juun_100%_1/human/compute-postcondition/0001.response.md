`trump` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means it will hold the value of whatever character is input by the user. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", and `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is one of "23456789" and the second character is one of "CDHS"; `trump` is the character input by the user.**
