The only variable in the loop head is `answer`, which iterates over `answers`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `answers` must contain at least one element. The state of `trumps`, `answers`, and `suits` needs to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`trumps` is [], `answers` is a list with at least one element, `suits` remains unchanged, `answer` is the first element in the `answers` list**
