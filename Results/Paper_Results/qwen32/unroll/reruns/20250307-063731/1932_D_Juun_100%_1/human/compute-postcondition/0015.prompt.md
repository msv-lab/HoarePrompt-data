You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, trump_suit is a character from "CDHS", and cards is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is one of "23456789" and the second character is one of "CDHS".
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: `trumps` is a list of ranks of cards that are of the trump suit; `answers` is a list of strings, each representing a pair of non-trump cards sorted by rank; `suits` is a dictionary where each key is a suit and the value is either `None` or the rank of an unmatched card of that suit.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: trumps is a list with remaining trump ranks, answers is a list with additional paired strings, and suits is a dictionary with None for matched suits.
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: trumps is [], answers remains unchanged, suits remains unchanged.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: trumps is [], answers remains unchanged, suits remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no direct parameters but is likely to process input values `t`, `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` as described. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`, a character `trump_suit` representing the trump suit, and a list of `2n` unique two-character strings `cards` representing the cards. For each test case, the function evaluates the cards based on the trump suit and returns the result of some comparison or evaluation (likely determining a winner or ranking the cards) for each test case.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
