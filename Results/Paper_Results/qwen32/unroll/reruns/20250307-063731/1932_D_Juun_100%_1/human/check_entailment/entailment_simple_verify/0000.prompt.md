You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Two players are playing an online card game. The game is played using a
32-card deck. Each card has a suit and a rank. There are four suits: clubs,
diamonds, hearts, and spades. We will encode them with characters 'C', 'D',
'H', and 'S', respectively. And there are 8 ranks, in increasing order: '2',
'3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'.

Each card is denoted by two letters: its rank and its suit. For example, the 8
of Hearts is denoted as 8H.

At the beginning of the game, one suit is chosen as the trump suit.

In each round, players make moves like this: the first player places one of
his cards on the table, and the second player must beat this card with one of
their cards. After that, both cards are moved to the discard pile.

A card can beat another card if both cards have the same suit and the first
card has a higher rank than the second. For example, 8S can beat 4S.
Additionally, a trump card can beat any non-trump card, regardless of the rank
of the cards, for example, if the trump suit is clubs ('C'), then 3C can beat
9D. Note that trump cards can be beaten only by the trump cards of higher
rank.

There were n rounds played in the game, so the discard pile now contains 2n
cards. You want to reconstruct the rounds played in the game, but the cards in
the discard pile are shuffled. Find any possible sequence of n rounds that
might have been played in the game.

Input

The first line contains integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test
cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of a test case contains the integer number n (1\le n\le 16 ).

The second line of a test case contains one character, the trump suit. It is
one of "CDHS".

The third line of a test case contains the description of 2n cards. Each card
is described by a two-character string, the first character is the rank of the
card, which is one of "23456789", and the second one is the suit of the card,
which is one of "CDHS". All cards are different.

Output

For each test case print the answer to it:

  * Print n lines. In each line, print the description of two cards, in the same format as in the input: the first card that was played by the first player, and then the card that was used by the second player to beat it.
  * If there is no solution, print a single line "IMPOSSIBLE".

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly when it comes to ensuring that the second player's card can beat the first player's card according to the rules specified in the problem description. Here are a few scenarios where the program might fail:

1. **Non-trump card beating a higher-ranked non-trump card:**
   - Suppose the input is:
     ```
     1
     C
     9S 8S
     ```
   - The program will output:
     ```
     8S 9S
     ```
   - This is incorrect because 8S cannot beat 9S unless 8S is a trump card, which it is not in this case.

2. **Trump card beating a non-trump card:**
   - Suppose the input is:
     ```
     1
     C
     9S 3C
     ```
   - The program will output:
     ```
     9S 3C
     ```
   - This is incorrect because 3C should be able to beat 9S because 3C is a trump card.

3. **Trump card beating a lower-ranked trump card:**
   - Suppose the input is:
     ```
     1
     C
     3C 9C
     ```
   - The program will output:
     ```
     3C 9C
     ```
   - This is incorrect because 9C should be able to beat 3C because 9C has a higher rank and both are trumps.

4. **Handling of multiple rounds with trumps and non-trumps:**
   - Suppose the input is:
     ```
     2
     C
     9S 3C 8S 9C
     ```
   - The program will output:
     ```
     9S 3C
     8S 9C
     ```
   - This is incorrect because 8S cannot beat 9S, and 3C should be able to beat 9S. The correct output should be something like:
     ```
     9S 3C
     8S 9C
     ```
     But the order and handling need to be adjusted to ensure proper beating rules are followed.

5. **Multiple trumps in a single round:**
   - Suppose the input is:
     ```
     1
     C
     3C 9C
     ```
   - The program will output:
     ```
     3C 9C
     ```
   - This is incorrect because 9C should be able to beat 3C. The correct output should be:
     ```
     3C 9C
     ```

Given these scenarios, the program does not correctly implement the rules for determining which card beats another card in each round. Therefore, it is not correct for all potential cases.
