#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, trump_suit is a character from "CDHS", and cards is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is one of "23456789" and the second character is one of "CDHS".
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: `trumps` is a list of ranks of cards that are of the trump suit; `answers` is a list of strings, each representing a pair of non-trump cards sorted by rank; `suits` is a dictionary where each key is a suit and the value is either `None` or the rank of an unmatched card of that suit.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:

            return
        
    #State: trumps is a list with remaining trump ranks, answers is a list with additional paired strings, and suits is a dictionary with None for matched suits.
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

    for answer in answers:

    #State: trumps is [], answers remains unchanged, suits remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a set of cards and a trump suit. For each test case, it evaluates the cards, pairing non-trump cards of the same suit and using trump cards to pair any unmatched non-trump cards. It prints all pairs of cards, ensuring that trump cards are used optimally to match any unmatched cards. If there are unmatched cards and no trump cards available to pair them, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
