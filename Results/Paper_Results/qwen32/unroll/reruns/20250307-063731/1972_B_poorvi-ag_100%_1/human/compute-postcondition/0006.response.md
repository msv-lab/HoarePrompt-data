Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down. The function returns the number of groups of consecutive coins that are all facing the same direction (either all "U" or all "D") for each test case.**
