### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins. The key insight is that the game's outcome is solely determined by the parity (odd or even) of the number of coins facing up ("U"). If the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win.

The provided program reads multiple test cases, counts the number of "U" coins in each test case, and checks if this count is odd or even. It then appends "yes" to the results list if the count is odd and "no" if the count is even. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The logic within the program aligns perfectly with the problem's requirement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's functionality:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins, `n`, and the string `s` representing the coins.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It counts the number of "U" coins in the string `s` using `arr.count('U')`.
   - It checks if this count is odd by using the modulus operator (`% 2 == 1`).
   - If the count is odd, it appends "yes" to the results list, indicating that Alice will win.
   - If the count is even, it appends "no" to the results list, indicating that Bob will win.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results for each test case.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of "U" coins, it is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
