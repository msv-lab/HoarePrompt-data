The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the elements in the `results` list. To ensure that the loop executes, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The state of `t` (the number of test cases) does not directly affect the execution of this loop, as the loop iterates over `results` directly, not `t`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); `results` is a list containing at least one element (either 'yes' or 'no')**
