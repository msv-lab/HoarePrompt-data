#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting only of "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on whether the count of 'U' in the input string `arr` is odd.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: results is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on whether the count of 'U' in the input string `arr` is odd; t is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). The program has printed each element of the `results` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a string of "U" and "D" characters representing coins facing up or down. For each test case, it checks if the number of "U" characters is odd. If it is, the function outputs "yes"; otherwise, it outputs "no".
