Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the input string. According to the problem description, if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win; if it is even, Bob will always win. This is because the game mechanics ensure that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins will alternate with each move, and the player who starts with an odd number of facing-up coins will be the one to make the last move.

The program reads multiple test cases, counts the number of 'U's in each test case, and determines the winner based on the parity of this count. It then prints the result for each test case.

Let's verify the program with the provided example:
- For the first test case (`UUDUD`), there are 3 'U's, which is odd, so the output is "YES".
- For the second test case (`UDDUD`), there are 2 'U's, which is even, so the output is "NO".
- For the third test case (`UU`), there are 2 'U's, which is even, so the output is "NO".

All these results match the expected outcomes as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem description and all potential cases within the constraints.
