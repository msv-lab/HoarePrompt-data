### Reasoning:

The game revolves around the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins ("U"). The key insight is that the player who starts the game (Alice) will win if the number of "U" coins is odd, and Bob will win if the number of "U" coins is even. This is because:

1. **Odd Number of "U" Coins:**
   - If the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where the number of "U" coins is even after his turn. This continues until Bob is left with no "U" coins to flip, and he loses.

2. **Even Number of "U" Coins:**
   - If the number of "U" coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that after his turn, the number of "U" coins remains even. This continues until Alice is left with no "U" coins to flip, and she loses.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the count of "U" in each test case and determining the winner based on whether the count is odd or even.
