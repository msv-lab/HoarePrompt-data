Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of the number of players `k`, the number of queries `q`, a list of positions `p` of players to be kicked out, and a list of queries `qs`. For each query in `qs`, it calculates the remaining players after removing the players at positions specified in `p` and prints the result after each query.**
