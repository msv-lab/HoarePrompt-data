Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the problem at hand.

1. **Output Formatting**: The current implementation of `func_2` prints the results after each iteration of the loop over `qs`. This means it will print partial results for each `n` in `qs` for each test case, which is not the desired behavior. According to the problem description, the output for each test case should be a single line containing all the results for that test case.

2. **Logic in `func_1`**: The logic in `func_1` is not correctly implemented to simulate the game as described. The function should remove players at the specified positions (`p`) in each round, considering the updated order of players after each round, until no more players can be removed. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the removal of players based on their positions in the updated list of players.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def simulate_game(n, p):
    players = list(range(1, n + 1))
    while True:
        kicked_out = set()
        for pos in p:
            if pos - 1 < len(players):
                kicked_out.add(players[pos - 1])
        if not kicked_out:
            break
        players = [player for player in players if player not in kicked_out]
    return len(players)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [simulate_game(n, p) for n in qs]
        results.append(' '.join(map(str, res)))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to read input and process
func_2()
```

In the corrected version:
- The `simulate_game` function correctly simulates the game by maintaining a list of players and removing those at the specified positions in each round until no more players can be removed.
- The `func_2` function collects all results for a test case before printing them, ensuring the output format is correct.
