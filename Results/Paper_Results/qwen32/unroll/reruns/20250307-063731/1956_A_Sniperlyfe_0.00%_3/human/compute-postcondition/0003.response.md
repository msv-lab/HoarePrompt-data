Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a non-negative integer representing the number of players, and `p`, a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, where 1 <= len(p) <= 100 and 1 <= p[i] <= 100 for all i. The function returns a list of players that remain after each round of kicking out players as specified in the list `p`.**
