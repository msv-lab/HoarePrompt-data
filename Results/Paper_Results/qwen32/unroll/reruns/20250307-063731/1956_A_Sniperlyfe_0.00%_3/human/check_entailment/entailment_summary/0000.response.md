### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided functions and their behavior to see if they meet the problem requirements.

**Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
- **Parameters**: 
  - `n`: The initial number of players in the game.
  - `p`: A list of positions of players to be kicked out in each round.
- **Behavior**: 
  - The function repeatedly reduces `n` by the count of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` until `n` is less than the smallest position in `p`.
  - This simulates the rounds of the game where players are kicked out based on their positions.
  - The function returns the number of players remaining after all possible rounds of kicking out players.

**Function `func_2()`**:
- **Behavior**:
  - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads `k` (length of sequence `a`), `q` (number of queries), the sequence `a` itself, and the list of queries `qs`.
  - For each query `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, a)` to determine the number of players remaining after the game ends for `n` initial players.
  - It prints the results after each query, which should match the expected output for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The function `func_1(n, p)` correctly simulates the game's logic by reducing `n` based on the positions specified in `p` until no more players can be kicked out.
- The function `func_2()` correctly handles multiple test cases and queries, calling `func_1` appropriately for each query and printing the results.

### Conclusion:
Both functions together correctly implement the game's logic and handle the input/output as specified in the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
