You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_k .

In this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds
of this game, the following happens:

  * Nene finds the a_1 -th, a_2 -th, \ldots , a_k -th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i -th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. 

Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are
still in the game are declared as winners.

For example, consider the game with a=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players
be named player A, player B, \ldots , player E in the order they are lined up
initially. Then,

  * Before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round. 
  * Now players are lined up as ABD. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. The 3 -rd player is player D and there is no 5 -th player in a row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round. 
  * In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. 
  * Players A and B are declared as the winners. 

Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene
gave you q integers n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_q and you should answer the following
question for each 1 \le i \le q independently:

  * How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially? 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 250 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line case contains two integers k and q (1 \le k, q \le 100 ) — the
length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this
problem for.

The second line contains k integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k (1\leq
a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_k\leq 100 ) — the sequence a .

The third line contains q integers n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_q (1\leq n_i \leq 100 ).

Output

For each test case, output q integers: the i -th (1\le i \le q ) of them
should be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players
join the game.

Note

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, when n=1 , the only player stays in the game in the
first round. After that, the game ends and the only player is declared as a
winner.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))
    return n

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of the number of players `k`, the number of queries `q`, a list of positions `p` of players to be kicked out, and a list of queries `qs`. For each query in `qs`, it calculates the remaining players after removing the players at positions specified in `p` and prints the result after each query.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding

The game involves a sequence of integers `a` and a number of players `n`. In each round, players at positions `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` are kicked out if they exist. The game continues until no more players are kicked out. The goal is to determine how many players remain after the game ends for different initial numbers of players `n_1, n_2, ..., n_q`.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions:

1. **`func_1(n, p)`**:
   - This function takes the current number of players `n` and the list of positions `p`.
   - It repeatedly subtracts the count of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n` until `n` is less than the smallest position in `p`.
   - The final value of `n` is returned, representing the number of players remaining after the game ends.

2. **`func_2()`**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `k`, `q`, the list of positions `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It then calculates the number of remaining players for each initial player count using `func_1`.
   - The results are printed after each calculation.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided example.

#### Example Walkthrough

**First Test Case:**
- Input: `2 1`, `3 5`, `5`
- `n = 5`, `p = [3, 5]`
- **Round 1**: Players 3 and 5 are kicked out. Remaining players: `3`
- **Round 2**: Player 3 is kicked out. Remaining players: `2`
- **Round 3**: No players are kicked out. Remaining players: `2`
- The function `func_1(5, [3, 5])` correctly returns `2`.

**Second Test Case:**
- Input: `5 3`, `2 4 6 7 9`, `1 3 5`
- **For `n = 1`**:
  - **Round 1**: No players are kicked out. Remaining players: `1`
- **For `n = 3`**:
  - **Round 1**: Players 2 and 4 are kicked out. Remaining players: `1`
- **For `n = 5`**:
  - **Round 1**: Players 2, 4, and 6 are kicked out. Remaining players: `2`
  - **Round 2**: No players are kicked out. Remaining players: `2`
- The function `func_1` correctly returns `1 1 2` for `n = [1, 3, 5]`.

**Third Test Case:**
- Input: `5 4`, `3 4 5 6 7`, `1 2 3 4`
- **For `n = 1`**:
  - **Round 1**: No players are kicked out. Remaining players: `1`
- **For `n = 2`**:
  - **Round 1**: No players are kicked out. Remaining players: `2`
- **For `n = 3`**:
  - **Round 1**: Player 3 is kicked out. Remaining players: `2`
- **For `n = 4`**:
  - **Round 1**: Players 3 and 4 are kicked out. Remaining players: `2`
- The function `func_1` correctly returns `1 2 2 2` for `n = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` correctly simulates the game and calculates the number of remaining players for each initial player count. The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results as required.
