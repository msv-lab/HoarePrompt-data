To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to carefully analyze the given code snippet and understand the transformations applied to the variables within the loop.

Here's the provided code:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = []
    for n in qs:
        res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

Let's break down the loop:
- The loop runs `t` times.
- For each iteration, the following occurs:
  - `k` and `q` are read as integers from the input.
  - `p` is read as a list of integers from the input.
  - `qs` is read as a list of integers from the input.
  - `res` is initialized as an empty list.
  - For each element `n` in `qs`, the function `func_1(n, p)` is called, and the result is appended to `res`.
  - After each call to `func_1`, the current state of `res` is printed.

The variables `k` and `q` are read but not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, they do not affect the output state. The list `p` is redefined in each iteration, and the list `qs` is also redefined in each iteration. The list `res` is created anew in each iteration and is only used within that iteration.

Since the list `res` is re-initialized and used only within each iteration, it does not persist across iterations. The final state of `res` after all iterations would be an empty list because it is not accumulated or stored outside the loop.

The variable `n` in the outer scope (initial state) is not affected by the loop because it is shadowed by the loop variable `n` in the inner loop.

Thus, the output state after the loop completes all iterations will be:
- `n` remains unchanged (the initial number of players).
- `p` will be the last list of positions read in the last iteration of the loop.
- `t` remains unchanged (the number of iterations).

However, the question asks for the state of variables that are affected by the loop head and body, and since `res` is the only list that gets modified within the loop, and it does not persist, we can infer that no changes are made to the initial state variables `n` and `t`, and `p` is the last read value.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is the same non-negative integer, `p` is the list of positions from the last iteration, `t` is the same integer.**
