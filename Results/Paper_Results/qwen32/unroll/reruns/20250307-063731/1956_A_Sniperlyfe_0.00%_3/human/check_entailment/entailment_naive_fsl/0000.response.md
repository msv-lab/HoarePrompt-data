Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a couple of issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Output**:
   - The current implementation of `func_2` prints the results after each iteration of the inner loop, which means it prints intermediate results instead of printing the results for all `q` values of `n` for a single test case at once. This is not in line with the problem description, which requires printing all `q` results for a test case in a single line.

2. **Inefficient Calculation**:
   - The `func_1` function is supposed to simulate the process of kicking out players according to the rules described in the problem statement. However, the logic is not completely aligned with the rules. The while loop in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the process of finding and removing players in each round. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that after removing players, the remaining players reindex, and the next round should start with the new lineup.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, p):
    players = list(range(1, n + 1))
    while True:
        removed = set()
        for pos in p:
            if pos - 1 < len(players):
                removed.add(players[pos - 1])
        if not removed:
            break
        players = [player for player in players if player not in removed]
    return len(players)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        results.append(' '.join(map(str, res)))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- **Simulation of Rounds**: The `func_1` function now correctly simulates the rounds by maintaining a list of players. In each round, it identifies which players need to be removed based on the current lineup and then updates the lineup by removing those players.
- **Correct Output Handling**: The `func_2` function now collects all results for a single test case and prints them all at once, separated by spaces, as required by the problem description.

This corrected version ensures that all edge cases are handled correctly and the output format matches the problem's requirements.
