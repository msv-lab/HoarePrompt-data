### Reasoning:

The main goal of the program is to determine how many players remain after repeatedly removing players at specified positions until no more players can be removed. The program is divided into two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

- **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
  - **Purpose**: This function calculates the number of players remaining after repeatedly removing players at positions specified in `p` until no more players can be removed.
  - **Logic**: The function uses a while loop to repeatedly remove players. It continues as long as the number of players `n` is greater than or equal to the smallest position in `p`. In each iteration, it calculates how many players at positions in `p` are still in the game (i.e., positions `x` such that `x <= n`) and subtracts this count from `n`. This process continues until `n` is less than the smallest position in `p`.
  - **State**: At the end of the function, `n` is the number of players remaining after all possible removals.

- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - **Purpose**: This function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of the number of players `k`, the number of queries `q`, a list of positions `p` of players to be kicked out, and a list of queries `qs`. For each query in `qs`, it calculates the remaining players after removing the players at positions specified in `p` and prints the result after each query.
  - **Logic**: The function reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`. It then iterates over each query `n` in `qs`, calls `func_1(n, p)` to determine the number of remaining players, and appends the result to `res`. After processing all queries for a test case, it prints the results.

### Analysis:

- **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
  - The logic of `func_1` is correct. It correctly simulates the process of removing players at specified positions until no more players can be removed. The function ensures that the smallest position in `p` is always considered for removal, and it correctly updates the number of players `n` by subtracting the count of removable players in each iteration.

- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - The logic of `func_2` is correct as well. It correctly processes multiple test cases, reads the input for each test case, and uses `func_1` to determine the number of remaining players for each query. It also correctly prints the results after processing each query.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Both `func_1` and `func_2` work as intended, and the overall program correctly handles multiple test cases and queries.

**Correctness: True**
