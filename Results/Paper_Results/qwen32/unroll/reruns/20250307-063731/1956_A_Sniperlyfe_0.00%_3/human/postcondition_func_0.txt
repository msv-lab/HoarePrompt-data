The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a non-negative integer representing the initial number of players, and `p`, a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, where each element in `p` is greater than 0 and `p` is sorted in increasing order. The function returns `n` reduced to the largest integer less than the smallest element in `p`, or remains unchanged if `p` is empty.
