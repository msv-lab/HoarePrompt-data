### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and the function summaries to ensure the correctness of the program based on the problem description.

#### Problem Understanding

The game involves a sequence of integers `a` and a number of players `n`. In each round, players at positions `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` are kicked out if they exist. The game continues until no more players are kicked out. The goal is to determine how many players remain after the game ends for different initial numbers of players `n_1, n_2, ..., n_q`.

#### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions:

1. **`func_1(n, p)`**:
   - This function takes the current number of players `n` and the list of positions `p`.
   - It repeatedly subtracts the count of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n` until `n` is less than the smallest position in `p`.
   - The final value of `n` is returned, representing the number of players remaining after the game ends.

2. **`func_2()`**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `k`, `q`, the list of positions `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It then calculates the number of remaining players for each initial player count using `func_1`.
   - The results are printed after each calculation.

#### Correctness Check

Let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided example and the function summaries.

#### Example Walkthrough

**First Test Case:**
- Input: `2 1`, `3 5`, `5`
- `n = 5`, `p = [3, 5]`
- **Round 1**: Players 3 and 5 are kicked out. Remaining players: `3`
- **Round 2**: Player 3 is kicked out. Remaining players: `2`
- **Round 3**: No players are kicked out. Remaining players: `2`
- The function `func_1(5, [3, 5])` correctly returns `2`.

**Second Test Case:**
- Input: `5 3`, `2 4 6 7 9`, `1 3 5`
- **For `n = 1`**:
  - **Round 1**: No players are kicked out. Remaining players: `1`
- **For `n = 3`**:
  - **Round 1**: Players 2 and 4 are kicked out. Remaining players: `1`
- **For `n = 5`**:
  - **Round 1**: Players 2, 4, and 6 are kicked out. Remaining players: `2`
  - **Round 2**: No players are kicked out. Remaining players: `2`
- The function `func_1` correctly returns `1 1 2` for `n = [1, 3, 5]`.

**Third Test Case:**
- Input: `5 4`, `3 4 5 6 7`, `1 2 3 4`
- **For `n = 1`**:
  - **Round 1**: No players are kicked out. Remaining players: `1`
- **For `n = 2`**:
  - **Round 1**: No players are kicked out. Remaining players: `2`
- **For `n = 3`**:
  - **Round 1**: Player 3 is kicked out. Remaining players: `2`
- **For `n = 4`**:
  - **Round 1**: Players 3 and 4 are kicked out. Remaining players: `2`
- The function `func_1` correctly returns `1 2 2 2` for `n = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`

Let's analyze the logic of `func_1` to ensure it correctly simulates the game:

- **Initialization**: The function starts with the initial number of players `n`.
- **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the smallest position in `p`.
- **Subtraction**: In each iteration, it subtracts the count of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n`.
- **Termination**: The loop terminates when `n` is less than the smallest position in `p`, meaning no more players can be kicked out.

The logic of `func_1` correctly simulates the game by repeatedly removing players at the specified positions until no more players can be removed.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_2`

The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases and processes each one:

- **Reading Input**: It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads `k`, `q`, the list of positions `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
- **Calculating Results**: For each initial player count `n` in `qs`, it calculates the number of remaining players using `func_1` and stores the result.
- **Printing Results**: After processing all queries for a test case, it prints the results.

The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results as required.

### Conclusion

Both `func_1` and `func_2` correctly simulate the game and calculate the number of remaining players for each initial player count. The function summaries accurately describe the behavior of the functions.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**
