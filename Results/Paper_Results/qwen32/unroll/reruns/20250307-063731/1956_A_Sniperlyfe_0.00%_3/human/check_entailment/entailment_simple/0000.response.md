### Reasoning:

The given problem involves simulating a game where players are kicked out based on their positions in a sequence of rounds. The function `func_1` is designed to determine the number of players remaining after all possible rounds of kicking out players according to the sequence `p`.

Let's analyze the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function takes the initial number of players `n` and a list of positions `p` from which players are to be kicked out in each round. It returns the number of players remaining after all possible rounds.
   - **Logic**:
     - The `while` loop continues as long as `n` (the number of players) is greater than or equal to the smallest position in `p` (i.e., `min(p)`).
     - In each iteration, it calculates how many players are to be kicked out in the current round by summing up `1` for each position in `p` that is less than or equal to `n`.
     - It then subtracts this sum from `n`, effectively reducing the number of players by the number of players kicked out in the current round.
     - The loop continues until no more players can be kicked out (i.e., `n` is less than the smallest position in `p`).
     - Finally, it returns the number of remaining players, `n`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function handles multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the input values, processes them using `func_1`, and prints the results.
   - **Logic**:
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the number of positions `k` and the number of queries `q`.
     - It reads the list of positions `p` and the list of queries `qs`.
     - For each query `n` in `qs`, it calculates the number of remaining players using `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to the list `res`.
     - After processing all queries for the current test case, it prints the results.

### Correctness:

The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the game rounds and calculates the number of remaining players. The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and handles the input/output as specified in the problem statement. The program appears to be correctly implemented based on the provided logic and the annotated states.

### Output of the Program:

The provided program seems to be correct based on the problem description and the annotated states. The output format and the logic of the program match the requirements.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
