### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's should be on the left, and all '1's should be on the right) using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) is \( r - l + 1 \).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the string and swapping '1's and '0's when they are found in the wrong order. It calculates the cost based on the positions of these elements.

#### Annotations:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `s` is initialized as a list of characters from the input string `sChar`.
   - `left` and `right` pointers are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
   - `cost` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop**:
   - The loop runs while `left <= right` and `right < len(s)` and `left < len(s)`.
   - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', the elements are swapped, and the cost is incremented by `right - left + 1`.
   - The `right` pointer is incremented until it points to the next '0'.
   - The `left` pointer is incremented until it points to the next '1'.

3. **Final State**:
   - The final state given in the annotation is `s = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '1']`, `left = 5`, `right = 5`, `cost = 6`.

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The program directly swaps '0's and '1's and calculates the cost based on the positions of these elements. However, a cyclic shift involves moving a substring, and the cost should reflect the length of the substring being shifted, not just the positions of the swapped elements.
   - For example, in the string "11000", swapping '1' and '0' at positions 0 and 2 does not reflect the actual cost of a cyclic shift.

2. **Inefficient Handling of Substrings**:
   - The program does not consider the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts. It only swaps adjacent elements, which may not result in the minimum cost.
   - For example, in the string "101011", the optimal way to sort the string would involve shifting substrings in a way that results in a lower total cost.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program might work for some simple cases, but it is not guaranteed to work for all possible inputs, especially when the string requires multiple cyclic shifts to be sorted.

#### Counterexample:
- **Input**: `101011`
- **Expected Output**: `5`
- **Actual Output**: The program does not necessarily produce `5` for this input because it does not consider the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The program's logic is flawed, and it does not handle the cost calculation and substring handling efficiently.

**Final: False**
