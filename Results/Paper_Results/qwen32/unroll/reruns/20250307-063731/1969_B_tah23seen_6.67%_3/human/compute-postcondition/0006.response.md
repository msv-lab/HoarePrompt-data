To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s))` evaluates to `True`.

Let's break down the condition:

1. **`left <= right`**: Given that `left` is 0 and `right` is 1, this condition is already `True` (0 <= 1).

2. **`right < len(s)`**: For this condition to be `True`, `right` (which is 1) must be less than the length of the list `s`. Since `s` contains all the strings from `sChar` in the same order, the length of `s` must be at least 2 for this condition to hold true (because `right` is 1).

3. **`(left < len(s))`**: Given that `left` is 0, this condition is `True` as long as the length of `s` is at least 1. However, since we already determined that `right < len(s)` requires the length of `s` to be at least 2, this condition will naturally be satisfied as well.

Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that the length of `s` is at least 2.

State: **`s` is a list that contains at least 2 strings from `sChar` in the same order, `sChar` remains unchanged, `left` is 0, `cost` is 0, `right` is 1**
