#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a list of strings, where each string s consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string s satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total sum of the lengths of all strings in sChar does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: `s` is a list that contains all the strings from `sChar` in the same order, and `sChar` remains unchanged.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: s = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '1'], left = 5, right = 5, cost = 6.
    return cost
    #The program returns cost, which is 6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of strings, where each string consists of only '0's and '1's. It processes these strings to calculate a cost based on swapping '0's and '1's under specific conditions and returns this cost. The annotated return postcondition stating the cost is always 6 is not necessarily accurate for all inputs, as the cost is dynamically calculated based on the input strings.
