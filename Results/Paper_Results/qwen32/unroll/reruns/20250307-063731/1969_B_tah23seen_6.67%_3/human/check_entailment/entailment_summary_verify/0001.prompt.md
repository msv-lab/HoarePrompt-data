You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            (s[right], s[left]) = (s[left], s[right])
            cost += right - left + 1
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
    return cost



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of strings, where each string consists of only '0's and '1's. It processes these strings to calculate a cost based on swapping '0's and '1's under specific conditions and returns this cost. The annotated return postcondition stating the cost is always 6 is not necessarily accurate for all inputs, as the cost is dynamically calculated based on the input strings.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's followed by all '1's) using the minimum total cost. The cost of sorting a substring is the length of that substring.

### Program Analysis
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `sChar` as input and attempts to calculate the minimum cost to sort the string. Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The string `sChar` is converted into a list `s`.
   - Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
   - A variable `cost` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total cost.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop runs as long as `left <= right` and `right < len(s)` and `left < len(s)`.
   - Inside the loop, the program checks if `s[right] == '0'` and `s[left] == '1'`. If so, it swaps these characters and adds the cost `right - left + 1` to the total cost.
   - The `right` pointer is incremented until it points to a '0' or reaches the end of the string.
   - The `left` pointer is incremented until it points to a '1' or reaches the end of the string.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The program swaps `s[right]` and `s[left]` directly, but this does not simulate a cyclic shift of the substring. The cost calculation `right - left + 1` is correct for a cyclic shift, but the actual operation performed is not.
   - The program does not correctly handle the cyclic shift of substrings.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple '0's and '1's need to be swapped in a more optimal manner.
   - The program does not ensure that the string is sorted in the minimum cost manner.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, a more efficient approach would be to count the number of '1's before each '0' and sum these counts. This approach ensures that each '1' is moved to the right of all '0's with the minimum cost.

### Correctness
Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

Correctness: **False**
