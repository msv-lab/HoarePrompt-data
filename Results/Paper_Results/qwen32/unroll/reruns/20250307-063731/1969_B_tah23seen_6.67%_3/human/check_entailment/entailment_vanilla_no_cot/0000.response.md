Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the described cyclic shift operation. The algorithm attempts to swap '1's and '0's by finding the first '1' and the first '0' after it and then swapping them, but this approach does not guarantee the minimum cost and does not handle all possible cases correctly.

For example, consider the string "101011". The provided program might swap the first '1' with the first '0' it encounters, but this does not necessarily lead to the minimum cost solution. The optimal strategy involves more complex operations and considerations.

A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated approach, such as counting the number of inversions or using dynamic programming to find the minimum cost to sort the string.
