### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted. However, the implementation in `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost for sorting the string.

Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. **Incorrect Swapping Mechanism**: The program swaps '0's and '1's when it encounters a '0' on the right and a '1' on the left. However, simply swapping these characters does not necessarily result in the minimum cost to sort the string. The cost calculation `(right - left + 1)` is applied to every swap, which may not reflect the actual minimal operations needed to sort the string.

2. **Inefficient Handling of Substrings**: The logic does not consider optimal substrings for cyclic shifts. It only swaps adjacent '0's and '1's, which may not be the most efficient way to sort the string.

3. **Lack of Sorting Strategy**: The program does not implement a strategy to ensure the entire string is sorted with minimal cost. It only focuses on swapping '0's and '1's without considering the overall sorted order of the string.

4. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation is simplistic and does not reflect the true cost of sorting the string. The cost should be based on the minimal number of operations required to sort the string, which may involve more complex manipulations of substrings.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**

The program needs a more sophisticated approach to determine the minimal cost to sort the binary string. One possible approach could involve counting the number of '1's that need to be moved to the right of '0's and calculating the cost based on the minimal number of operations required to achieve this.
