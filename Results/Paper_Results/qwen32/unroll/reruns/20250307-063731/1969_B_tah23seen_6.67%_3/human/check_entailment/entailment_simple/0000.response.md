Reasoning:
The provided program aims to calculate the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. However, the logic implemented in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not correctly compute the minimum cost.

Here are the key issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation in the program is incorrect. The program swaps '0' and '1' whenever it finds a '0' to the right of a '1' and adds the cost as `right - left + 1`. However, this does not account for the fact that a single cyclic shift can potentially move multiple '0's to the left, and the cost should reflect the minimum number of operations required to achieve the sorted order.
   
2. **Incorrect Movement of Pointers**:
   - After a swap, the program increments `right` and `left` pointers to the next '0' and '1' respectively. This logic does not consider the possibility of multiple '0's or '1's in a row, and it does not handle the case where multiple swaps can be made in a single operation.

3. **Inefficient Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases efficiently, such as strings that are already sorted or strings that require multiple operations to sort.

4. **Incorrect State Representation**:
   - The state representation in the comments does not match the actual state of the program. For example, the comment states `s = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '1'], left = 5, right = 5, cost = 6`, which is not consistent with the logic of the program.

5. **Incorrect Output for Given Test Cases**:
   - The program does not produce the correct output for the provided test cases. For example, for the input "10", the correct output should be 2, but the program may not produce this output due to the flawed logic.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
