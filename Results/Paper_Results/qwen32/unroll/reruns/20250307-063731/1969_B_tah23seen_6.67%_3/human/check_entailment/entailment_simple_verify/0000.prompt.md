You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

            (s[right], s[left]) = (s[left], s[right])
            cost += right - left + 1

while t:

    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a list of strings, where each string s consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string s satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total sum of the lengths of all strings in sChar does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: `s` is a list that contains all the strings from `sChar` in the same order, and `sChar` remains unchanged.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: s = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '1'], left = 5, right = 5, cost = 6.
    return cost
    #The program returns cost, which is 6.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Swapping Elements**:
   - The code attempts to swap '1' and '0' elements directly if it finds a '0' to the right of a '1'. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum cost because it does not consider the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to bring all '0's to the left and all '1's to the right.
   - For example, in the string "101011", the code might swap '1' and '0' at positions 0 and 1, resulting in "011011", but the optimal way would involve multiple cyclic shifts that result in a lower total cost.

2. **Inefficient Handling of Substrings**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the cost calculation for cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted, but the code simply adds `right - left + 1` whenever it swaps elements, which does not reflect the actual cost of a cyclic shift.
   - For example, in the string "11000", the code might swap '1' and '0' at positions 0 and 2, resulting in a cost of 3, but the optimal way would involve shifting substrings in a way that results in a lower total cost.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases such as strings that are already sorted or strings with all '0's or all '1's. While the code might work for these cases, it is not guaranteed to work for all possible inputs.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:
- **Input**: `101011`
- **Expected Output**: `5`
- **Actual Output**: `5` (assuming the code runs without errors, but the logic is incorrect)

However, the code does not necessarily produce `5` for this input. The logic of directly swapping elements does not guarantee the minimum cost. The correct approach would involve finding the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to sort the string, which is more complex than the current implementation.

Thus, the program is incorrect due to the flawed logic and inefficient handling of cyclic shifts.
