### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotated version to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's followed by all '1's) using the minimum total cost. The cost of sorting a substring is the length of that substring.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `sChar` as input and attempts to calculate the minimum cost to sort the string. Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The string `sChar` is converted into a list `s`.
   - Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
   - A variable `cost` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total cost.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop runs as long as `left <= right` and `right < len(s)` and `left < len(s)`.
   - Inside the loop, the program checks if `s[right] == '0'` and `s[left] == '1'`. If so, it swaps these characters and adds the cost `right - left + 1` to the total cost.
   - The `right` pointer is incremented until it points to a '0' or reaches the end of the string.
   - The `left` pointer is incremented until it points to a '1' or reaches the end of the string.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The program swaps `s[right]` and `s[left]` directly, but this does not simulate a cyclic shift of the substring. The cost calculation `right - left + 1` is correct for a cyclic shift, but the actual operation performed is not.
   - The program does not correctly handle the cyclic shift of substrings.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple '0's and '1's need to be swapped in a more optimal manner.
   - The program does not ensure that the string is sorted in the minimum cost manner.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
The annotated code provides the following insights:
- The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the cost to sort the string `s`.
- The `left` and `right` pointers are used to find pairs of '1' and '0' to swap.
- The cost is accumulated based on the distance between the `left` and `right` pointers whenever a swap is made.

However, the annotation states that the final cost is always 6 for the given example, which is not necessarily true for all inputs. The cost is dynamically calculated based on the input strings, and the provided example does not cover all possible cases.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, a more efficient approach would be to count the number of '1's before each '0' and sum these counts. This approach ensures that each '1' is moved to the right of all '0's with the minimum cost.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string. The program fails to handle cyclic shifts correctly and does not ensure an optimal solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
