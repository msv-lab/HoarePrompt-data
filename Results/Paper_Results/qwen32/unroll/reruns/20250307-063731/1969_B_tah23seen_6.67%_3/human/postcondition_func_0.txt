The function accepts a list of strings, where each string consists of only '0's and '1's. It processes these strings to calculate a cost based on swapping '0's and '1's under specific conditions and returns this cost. The annotated return postcondition stating the cost is always 6 is not necessarily accurate for all inputs, as the cost is dynamically calculated based on the input strings.
