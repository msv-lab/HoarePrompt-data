Let's analyze the given program and its logic in the context of the problem statement.

### Problem Recap
The task is to sort a binary string `s` using cyclic shifts of its substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift of a substring `s[l...r]` is `r - l + 1`. The goal is to find the minimum total cost to sort the string in non-descending order (i.e., all `0`s followed by all `1`s).

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a binary string. For each string, it calls the function `func_1` to compute the minimum cost to sort the string.

#### Function `func_1`
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `left` to 0, `cost` to 0, and `right` to 1.
2. **Loop**: The loop continues as long as `left <= right` and `right < len(s)`, and `left < len(s)`.
3. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, if `s[right] == '0'` and `s[left] == '1'`, it swaps these two characters and adds the cost `right - left + 1` to the total cost.
4. **Increment Pointers**: It then increments `right` until it finds a '0' and increments `left` until it finds a '1'.
5. **Return**: Finally, it returns the total cost.

### Issues in the Program
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation is incorrect. The cost should be based on the length of the substring being cyclically shifted, not just swapping individual characters. The provided code swaps characters directly, which does not reflect the actual cost of a cyclic shift.
- **Logic Flaw**: The logic of the loop and the conditions inside the loop do not correctly simulate the cyclic shift operation. The program does not actually perform cyclic shifts; it just swaps characters, which is not equivalent to a cyclic shift.
- **Inconsistent Return Value**: The comment `#State: s = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '1'], left = 5, right = 5, cost = 6.` is indicative of a specific case, but the function's return value is not consistently 6 for all inputs. The cost is dynamically calculated but the logic is flawed.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the required functionality to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
