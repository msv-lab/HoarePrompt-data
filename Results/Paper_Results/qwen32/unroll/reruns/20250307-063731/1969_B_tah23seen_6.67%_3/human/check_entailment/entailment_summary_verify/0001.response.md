### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment to determine if the original assessment is accurate or not.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's followed by all '1's) using the minimum total cost. The cost of sorting a substring is the length of that substring.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `sChar` as input and attempts to calculate the minimum cost to sort the string. Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The string `sChar` is converted into a list `s`.
   - Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
   - A variable `cost` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total cost.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop runs as long as `left <= right` and `right < len(s)` and `left < len(s)`.
   - Inside the loop, the program checks if `s[right] == '0'` and `s[left] == '1'`. If so, it swaps these characters and adds the cost `right - left + 1` to the total cost.
   - The `right` pointer is incremented until it points to a '0' or reaches the end of the string.
   - The `left` pointer is incremented until it points to a '1' or reaches the end of the string.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The program swaps `s[right]` and `s[left]` directly, but this does not simulate a cyclic shift of the substring. The cost calculation `right - left + 1` is correct for a cyclic shift, but the actual operation performed is not.
   - The program does not correctly handle the cyclic shift of substrings.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple '0's and '1's need to be swapped in a more optimal manner.
   - The program does not ensure that the string is sorted in the minimum cost manner.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, a more efficient approach would be to count the number of '1's before each '0' and sum these counts. This approach ensures that each '1' is moved to the right of all '0's with the minimum cost.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary states that the function processes the string to calculate a cost based on swapping '0's and '1's under specific conditions and returns this cost. However, this summary does not reflect the actual logic of the function, which incorrectly swaps characters directly instead of performing cyclic shifts.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues in the program and concludes that the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly simulate cyclic shifts and does not compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

Final: **False**
