Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program and Function Summary

#### Problem Description Recap:
The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

#### Program Code and Function Summary:
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a binary string. It then calls `func_1` to compute the minimum cost for each string. The function `func_1` attempts to swap '0's and '1's under specific conditions and calculates a cost based on these swaps.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary states that `func_1` calculates a cost based on swapping '0's and '1's, but the cost is dynamically calculated based on the input strings. The summary also mentions that a postcondition stating the cost is always 6 is not necessarily accurate.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Swapping Elements**:
   - The function `func_1` swaps '1' and '0' elements directly whenever it finds a '0' to the right of a '1'. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum cost because it does not consider the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to bring all '0's to the left and all '1's to the right.
   - Cyclic shifts involve moving a substring of characters, not just swapping individual characters. The function does not simulate cyclic shifts correctly.

2. **Inefficient Handling of Substrings**:
   - The function calculates the cost as `right - left + 1` whenever it swaps elements, which does not reflect the actual cost of a cyclic shift. The cost should be based on the length of the substring being shifted, not just the distance between two indices.
   - For example, in the string "11000", the function might swap '1' and '0' at positions 0 and 2, resulting in a cost of 3, but the optimal way would involve shifting substrings in a way that results in a lower total cost.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases such as strings that are already sorted or strings with all '0's or all '1's. While the function might work for these cases, it is not guaranteed to work for all possible inputs.

### Counterexample
Let's consider the input "101011":
- **Expected Output**: `5`
- **Actual Output**: The function might produce an incorrect result because it does not simulate cyclic shifts correctly.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The function `func_1` attempts to swap elements directly, which does not guarantee the minimum cost and does not simulate cyclic shifts correctly.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed logic and inefficient handling of cyclic shifts.
