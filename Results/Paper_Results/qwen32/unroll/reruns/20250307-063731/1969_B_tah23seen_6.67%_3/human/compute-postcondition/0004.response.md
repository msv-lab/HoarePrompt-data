The code snippet initializes a variable `cost` to 0. This does not affect the values of `s` or `sChar`, and `left` remains unchanged. The only change is the introduction of the `cost` variable with a value of 0.

Output State: **`s` is a list that contains all the strings from `sChar` in the same order, `sChar` remains unchanged, `left` is 0, `cost` is 0.**
