Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. `n` represents the number of elements, and `k` represents a value related to the number of possible pairs. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, if `k` is within the valid range (0 to n*(n-1)/2), it performs a calculation or check; otherwise, it may handle the case differently. The exact nature of the return value is not specified, but it is implied to be a result derived from the input values `n` and `k` for each test case.**
