You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10³), the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
        
    #State: the values of `n` and `k` for each test case have been processed, and for each test case, `1` is printed if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, otherwise `n - 1` is printed. The variable `i` will be equal to `t` after the loop completes, and `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. `n` represents the number of elements, and `k` represents a value related to the number of possible pairs. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, if `k` is within the valid range (0 to n*(n-1)/2), it performs a calculation or check; otherwise, it may handle the case differently. The exact nature of the return value is not specified, but it is implied to be a result derived from the input values `n` and `k` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
