You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem states that initially, there are \( n \) islands, and every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. Everule starts on island 1 and can visit other islands using these bridges. Dominater can destroy up to \( k \) bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit.

The goal is to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit if Dominater optimally destroys up to \( k \) bridges.

### Key Observations

1. **No Bridges Destroyed (\( k = 0 \))**: Everule can visit all \( n \) islands.
2. **Maximum Bridges Destroyed (\( k = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \))**: Dominater can destroy all bridges, leaving Everule on island 1 alone.
3. **Partial Bridges Destroyed (\( 0 < k < \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \))**: Dominater's strategy should be to disconnect as many islands as possible from island 1.

### Strategy

- If \( k \geq n - 1 \), Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands by destroying \( n - 1 \) bridges. Hence, Everule can only visit island 1.
- If \( k < n - 1 \), Dominater cannot disconnect island 1 from all other islands. Therefore, Everule can still visit \( n - k \) islands, but the problem asks for the minimum number of islands Everule can visit, which in this case is \( n - k \) if no better strategy exists. However, the optimal strategy is to disconnect as many islands as possible, and the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is \( n - k \) if \( k < n - 1 \). But the problem asks for the minimum number of islands Everule can visit, which will be \( n - k \) if \( k < n - 1 \), but the problem's output suggests a different approach where if \( k < n - 1 \), Everule can still visit \( n - 1 \) islands because Dominater cannot disconnect all other islands from island 1 with fewer than \( n - 1 \) bridges.

### Program Analysis

The provided program implements the following logic:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)

# The function `func` handles multiple test cases.
# For each test case, it checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.
# If true, it prints `1` (Everule can only visit island 1).
# Otherwise, it prints `n - 1` (Everule can visit all other islands except possibly one).
```

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic described above. If \( k \geq n - 1 \), it prints 1, meaning Everule can only visit island 1. If \( k < n - 1 \), it prints \( n - 1 \), meaning Everule can visit all other islands except possibly one, which aligns with the problem's requirement to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Thus, the program is correct.
