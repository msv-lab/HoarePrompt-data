The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The values of `n` and `k` for each test case are not yet read or processed. Therefore, the only change is that the variable `t` now holds the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10³). The values of `n` and `k` for each test case are not yet read or processed.**
