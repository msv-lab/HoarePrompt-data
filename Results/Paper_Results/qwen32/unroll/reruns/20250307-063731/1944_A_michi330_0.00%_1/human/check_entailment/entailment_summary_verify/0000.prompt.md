You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`; otherwise, it prints `n - 1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine if the program meets the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
- There are `n` islands numbered from 1 to `n`.
- Initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge.
- Dominater can destroy at most `k` bridges.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of islands (including island 1) that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

### Key Points:
1. **Initial Bridges**: Initially, there are \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) bridges.
2. **Dominater's Action**: Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges.
3. **Everule's Reach**: We need to calculate the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after the bridges are destroyed.

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program is as follows:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
```

### Logic in the Program:
- If `k >= n - 1`, it prints `1`.
- Otherwise, it prints `n - 1`.

### Potential Cases:
1. **Case 1**: `k >= n - 1`
   - If `k` is at least `n-1`, Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1 from all other islands. Therefore, Everule can only visit island 1.
   - This part of the logic is correct.

2. **Case 2**: `k < n - 1`
   - If `k` is less than `n-1`, Dominater cannot isolate island 1 from all other islands. Hence, Everule can visit all other islands except possibly one (if `k` is `n-2`).
   - The program prints `n-1`, which means Everule can visit `n-1` islands. This is not always correct because even with `k < n-1`, Dominater can strategically destroy bridges to prevent Everule from visiting certain islands.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider a counterexample to test the logic:
- **Input**: `n = 4`, `k = 2`
- **Expected Output**: `2`
  - Dominater can destroy the bridges between island 1 and island 2, and between island 1 and island 3. This leaves island 1 connected only to island 4.
  - Thus, Everule can visit islands 1 and 4.
- **Actual Output**: `2`
  - The program prints `n-1 = 3`, which is incorrect because Everule can only visit 2 islands.

### Conclusion:
The program is not correct because it fails to account for the optimal strategy Dominater can use to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit when `k < n-1`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where `k < n - 1`. It should consider the optimal way Dominater can destroy bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit, which is not simply `n-1`.
