### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the problem requirements step by step.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The main function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1` for each test case. The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions for a single test case.

The conditions for the pairs `(a, b)` are:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

Here's a breakdown of the logic in `func_1`:

1. **Outer Loop (`x` loop)**: Iterates over possible values of `x` starting from 1 up to the square root of `n`. This is because if `a` and `b` are both greater than the square root of `n`, then `a * b` would be greater than `n`, which is not possible given the constraints.
   
2. **Inner Loop (`y` loop)**: For each `x`, iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1. The condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` ensures that `a = x * k` and `b = y * k` are within the given bounds for some integer `k`.

3. **GCD Check**: The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that `x` and `y` are coprime, which simplifies the problem because if `x` and `y` share a common factor, the problem can be reduced to a smaller problem with `x' = x / g` and `y' = y / g` where `g = gcd(x, y)`.

4. **Counting Valid Pairs**: If `x` and `y` are coprime, the program counts the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` by calculating the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. This is because `a` can be any multiple of `x` up to `n` and `b` can be any multiple of `y` up to `m`, but they must satisfy the condition that `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.

5. **Printing the Count**: After processing all possible pairs for a given `n` and `m`, the program prints the count of valid pairs.

The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic described above. The loops and conditions are set up to ensure that all possible pairs are considered, and the GCD check ensures that the pairs are counted correctly.
