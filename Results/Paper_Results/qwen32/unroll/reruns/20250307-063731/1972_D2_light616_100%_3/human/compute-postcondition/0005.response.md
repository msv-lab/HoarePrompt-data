To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand how the variables `x`, `y`, and `cnt` are defined and used in the context of the program.

### Initial State Analysis

1. **x**: It is defined as the smallest integer for which \( x \times x \) is greater than \( n \). This means \( x \) is the smallest integer greater than the square root of \( n \).

2. **y**: It is initialized to 1.

3. **cnt**: It is the total count calculated based on some conditions inside the loops. However, since no loops or conditions are provided in the snippet, we can only infer that `cnt` is some integer value that is determined by these loops.

Given the absence of explicit loops or conditions in the provided code snippet, we can only describe `cnt` based on the information provided.

### Output Analysis

The `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt`. However, since the exact value of `cnt` is not provided in the initial state and there are no loops or conditions in the code snippet to determine it, we can only describe `cnt` in terms of how it is defined.

### Conclusion

Since the exact value of `cnt` is not determined by the given information, we can only describe it as the total count calculated based on the conditions inside the loops.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the total count calculated based on the conditions inside the loops)**
