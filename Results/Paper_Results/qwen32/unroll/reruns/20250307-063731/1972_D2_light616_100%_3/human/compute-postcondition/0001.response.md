The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in Python for loops where the loop variable is not needed.

Given that `t` is already described as a positive integer, the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than or equal to 1. There is no need to adjust `n` and `m` since they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
