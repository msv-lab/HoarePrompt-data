To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of `func_1()`. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot determine how it affects the variables `n`, `m`, or `t`. However, based on the given information, we can only infer the state of the loop control variable and the input integer `t`.

The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `func_1()` exactly `t` times. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used within the loop body. Therefore, the loop will decrement `t` from its initial value to 0, but since `t` is not modified within the loop, it will remain unchanged in the context of the output state.

Since `n` and `m` are not modified in the loop body and there is no information suggesting otherwise, they will retain their initial values.

Thus, the only variable that is directly affected by the loop is the loop variable itself, but since it is not used within the loop and `t` is not modified within the loop, the output state will be the same as the initial state for `n`, `m`, and `t`.

Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; t is an input integer.**
