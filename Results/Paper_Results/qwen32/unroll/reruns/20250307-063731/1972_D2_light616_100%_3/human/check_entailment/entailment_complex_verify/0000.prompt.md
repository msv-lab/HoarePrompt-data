You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: x is the smallest integer for which x * x is greater than n, y is 1, cnt is the total count calculated based on the conditions inside the loops.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the total count calculated based on the conditions inside the loops)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `m` and calculates a count based on certain conditions involving pairs of integers `x` and `y` where `x` and `y` are coprime. It then prints this count.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; t is an input integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times. The parameters `n` and `m` are mentioned in the annotations but are not used within `func_2` itself. The function does not return any value explicitly, and the final state of the program after it concludes is that `func_1` has been executed `t` times.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1()` is designed to iterate over pairs `(x, y)` and count valid pairs `(a, b)` based on the given conditions, but it does not cover all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the ranges `[1, n]` and `[1, m]`.

The main issue is that the function only considers pairs `(x, y)` where `x * x <= n` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. This means that it misses many potential pairs `(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are not in the form of `x` and `y` as defined in the loop. 

For example, consider the test case `n = 3, m = 5`. The correct pairs `(a, b)` are `(1, 1)` and `(3, 6)`, but the function will not find `(3, 6)` because it does not iterate over `x = 3` and `y = 2` in the way it is currently structured.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` in the ranges `[1, n]` and `[1, m]` and check if the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` holds. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

# main()
```

This corrected version ensures that all pairs `(a, b)` are checked, and it correctly counts the number of valid pairs according to the problem description.
