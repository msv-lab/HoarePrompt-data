### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided solution and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Solution Analysis

The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Function `func_1()`

The function `func_1()` uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\), with the constraints:
- \(x \cdot x \le n\)
- \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\)
- \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\)

If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

#### Function `func_2()`

The function `func_2()` reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Correctness Check

Let's examine if the logic in `func_1()` correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

The main logic in `func_1()` is to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and check if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it counts the number of valid pairs by considering the multiples of \((x + y) \cdot x\) and \((x + y) \cdot y\) within the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).

However, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to count all valid pairs \((a, b)\) for the given constraints. Here's why:

1. **Range of \(x\) and \(y\)**: The loop only considers \(x\) up to \(\sqrt{n}\) and \(y\) such that \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\). This does not cover all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
2. **Condition Check**: The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \equiv 0 \pmod{a + b}\) is not directly checked for all pairs \((a, b)\). The current logic only works for specific cases where \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\) and the multiples of \((x + y) \cdot x\) and \((x + y) \cdot y\) are considered.

### Verification Against Function Summary

The function summary for `func_2()` is correct in stating that it reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case. However, the function summary does not address the correctness of `func_1()` itself.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for all test cases as per the problem statement. The logic in `func_1()` is insufficient and does not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
