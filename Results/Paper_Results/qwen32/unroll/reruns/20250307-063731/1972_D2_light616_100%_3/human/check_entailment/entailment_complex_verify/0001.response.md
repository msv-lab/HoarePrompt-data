### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

#### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Solution Analysis

The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Function `func_1()`

The function `func_1()` uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\), with the constraints:
- \(x \cdot x \le n\)
- \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\)
- \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\)

If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

#### Function `func_2()`

The function `func_2()` reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Correctness Check

Let's examine if the logic in `func_1()` correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

The main logic in `func_1()` is to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and check if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it counts the number of valid pairs by considering the multiples of \((x + y) \cdot x\) and \((x + y) \cdot y\) within the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).

However, there are some issues with this approach:
1. **Range of \(x\) and \(y\)**: The loop only considers \(x\) up to \(\sqrt{n}\) and \(y\) such that \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\). This does not cover all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
2. **Condition Check**: The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \equiv 0 \pmod{a + b}\) is not directly checked for all pairs \((a, b)\). The current logic only works for specific cases where \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\) and the multiples of \((x + y) \cdot x\) and \((x + y) \cdot y\) are considered.

### Evaluation Using Annotations

The annotations provide insights into the state of the program at key points:
- The program reads \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case.
- The outer loop runs while \(x \cdot x \le n\).
- The inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
- If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

The annotations confirm that the program is only considering specific pairs \((x, y)\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and the multiples of \((x + y) \cdot x\) and \((x + y) \cdot y\) are within the bounds. This approach does not cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for all test cases as per the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

### Final: **False**
