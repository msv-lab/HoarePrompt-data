Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem described. Let's analyze why:

The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). 

The provided program attempts to solve this by iterating over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checking if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). However, this approach does not correctly capture the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\). Specifically, the program does not properly account for the values of \(a\) and \(b\) as specified in the problem, and the logic for counting valid pairs is flawed.

A correct solution would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\). However, given the constraints, a more efficient approach is necessary, possibly involving mathematical insights to reduce the number of checks.

Here is a corrected version of the program that directly checks the condition for all pairs:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

main()
```

However, this direct approach is not efficient enough for the given constraints. A more optimized approach would be required to handle the large input sizes efficiently.
