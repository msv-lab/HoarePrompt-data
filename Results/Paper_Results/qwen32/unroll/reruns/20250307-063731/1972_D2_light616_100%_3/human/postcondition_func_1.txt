The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times. The parameters `n` and `m` are mentioned in the annotations but are not used within `func_2` itself. The function does not return any value explicitly, and the final state of the program after it concludes is that `func_1` has been executed `t` times.
