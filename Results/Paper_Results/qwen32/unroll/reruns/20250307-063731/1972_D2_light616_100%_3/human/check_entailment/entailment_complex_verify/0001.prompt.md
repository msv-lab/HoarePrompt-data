You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: x is the smallest integer for which x * x is greater than n, y is 1, cnt is the total count calculated based on the conditions inside the loops.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the total count calculated based on the conditions inside the loops)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `m` and calculates a count based on certain conditions involving pairs of integers `x` and `y` where `x` and `y` are coprime. It then prints this count.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; t is an input integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times. The parameters `n` and `m` are mentioned in the annotations but are not used within `func_2` itself. The function does not return any value explicitly, and the final state of the program after it concludes is that `func_1` has been executed `t` times.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Function `func_1()`

The function `func_1()` uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\), with the constraints:
- \(x \cdot x \le n\)
- \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\)
- \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\)

If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

#### Function `func_2()`

The function `func_2()` reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Correctness Check

Let's examine if the logic in `func_1()` correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

The main logic in `func_1()` is to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and check if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it counts the number of valid pairs by considering the multiples of \((x + y) \cdot x\) and \((x + y) \cdot y\) within the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).

However, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to count all valid pairs \((a, b)\) for the given constraints. Here's why:

1. **Range of \(x\) and \(y\)**: The loop only considers \(x\) up to \(\sqrt{n}\) and \(y\) such that \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\). This does not cover all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
2. **Condition Check**: The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \equiv 0 \pmod{a + b}\) is not directly checked for all pairs \((a, b)\). The current logic only works for specific cases where \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\) and the multiples of \((x + y) \cdot x\) and \((x + y) \cdot y\) are considered.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for all test cases as per the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
