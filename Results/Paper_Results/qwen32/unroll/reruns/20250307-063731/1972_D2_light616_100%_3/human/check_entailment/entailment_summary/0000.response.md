To determine the correctness of the program based on the given problem description and the provided execution summaries, let's analyze the functions and their behavior.

### Function `func_1`

- **Purpose**: This function is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
- **Algorithm**:
  - It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) * y \le m\).
  - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) (i.e., \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime).
  - If \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
- **Output**: The function prints the count of valid pairs for a given pair of \(n\) and \(m\).

### Function `func_2`

- **Purpose**: This function handles multiple test cases.
- **Algorithm**:
  - It reads the number of test cases \(t\).
  - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to compute and print the number of valid pairs for the given \(n\) and \(m\).
- **Output**: The function does not return anything explicitly, but it ensures that `func_1` is executed for each test case.

### Analysis

The algorithm in `func_1` is designed to count valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the conditions provided in the problem statement. However, the algorithm implemented in `func_1` does not directly check the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\). Instead, it relies on the observation that if \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, then the count of valid pairs can be determined using the floor division of \(n\) and \(m\) by \((x + y) \cdot x\) and \((x + y) \cdot y\), respectively.

The logic in `func_1` seems to be based on a mathematical insight or transformation of the problem, rather than a brute-force approach. However, the provided execution summary does not explicitly validate the correctness of this transformation, and the algorithm might not cover all cases or might not be correct for all possible inputs.

Given the complexity and the transformation applied in `func_1`, without a rigorous mathematical proof or additional test cases, it is difficult to confirm the correctness of the algorithm solely based on the provided execution summary.

### Conclusion

While the code structure and the intended behavior seem reasonable, the correctness of the algorithm implemented in `func_1` is not fully validated by the provided execution summary. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot conclusively state that the program is correct for all possible inputs.

**Correctness: False**
