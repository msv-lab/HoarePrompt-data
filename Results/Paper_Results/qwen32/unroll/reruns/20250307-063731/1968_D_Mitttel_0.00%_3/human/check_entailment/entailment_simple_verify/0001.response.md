### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the provided annotations and the problem description.

#### Function 1: `func_1`
- **Description**: This function takes the number of elements `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (`PB` and `PS`), the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. It calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function and compares them to determine the winner or if the game is a draw.
- **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that the function correctly calls `calculate_score` for both players and compares their scores to determine the result.

#### Function 2: `calculate_score`
- **Description**: This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position. It follows the rules of the game:
  - It keeps track of the current position and the score.
  - It uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles in the permutation.
  - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by considering the full cycles and the remaining steps in the last partial cycle.
- **Annotations**: The annotations provide detailed states at various points in the function:
  - It correctly detects cycles and calculates the score efficiently.
  - The states match the expected behavior, such as the number of steps taken, the score accumulated, and the positions visited.

#### Function 3: `func_2`
- **Description**: This function reads the input from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the result for each one. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`, and calls `func_1` to determine the result.
- **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that the function correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

### Detailed Evaluation:

1. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The annotations show that the `calculate_score` function correctly identifies cycles in the permutation.
   - This is crucial because `k` can be very large, and without cycle detection, the function would run indefinitely.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - The annotations confirm that the score is calculated correctly by adding the score from the array `a` at each step.
   - It handles cycles efficiently by calculating the score for full cycles and the remaining steps in the last partial cycle.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and determines the winner or if the game is a draw.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles large inputs efficiently by detecting cycles and calculating scores correctly. The annotations provided match the expected behavior and confirm the correctness of the implementation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
