The code snippet `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the standard input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. This input will overwrite the previous values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, and the elements of `p` and `a` with the new values provided in the input string.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values split by whitespace. `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are not explicitly assigned new values in the given code snippet and are awaiting further processing.**
