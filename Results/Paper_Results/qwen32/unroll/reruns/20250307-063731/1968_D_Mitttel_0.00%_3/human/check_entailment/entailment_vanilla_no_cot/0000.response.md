Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a critical issue in the `func_1` function where it calls `calculate_score` without passing the `k`, `p`, and `a` parameters. This will result in a `TypeError` because `calculate_score` expects these parameters to be passed in order to correctly compute the scores for Bodya and Sasha.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):
    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB, k, p, a)
    sasha_score = calculate_score(PS, k, p, a)
    if bodya_score > sasha_score:
        return 'Bodya'
    elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Draw'
```

With this correction, the program should work as intended.
