### Reasoning:
The provided program consists of three functions, and we need to determine if they collectively solve the problem as described.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to calculate the scores for both Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions and determine the winner.
   - The function calls `calculate_score` for both players and compares their scores to determine the winner.
   - The logic of this function seems correct based on the problem description.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It follows the permutation sequence, accumulating scores from the `a` array.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the cycle and any remaining steps.
   - However, the output hint suggests that the function always returns a score of 14, which is incorrect and inconsistent with the problem requirements. This function should correctly compute the score based on the input parameters.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` to determine the result.
   - It then prints the result for each test case.
   - The logic of this function seems correct based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The issue lies in the `calculate_score` function, which does not correctly compute the score as described in the problem statement. Since the score calculation is incorrect, the overall program does not meet the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
