Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it processes the given parameters including the length of the permutation and array `n`, the duration of the game `k`, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha `PB` and `PS`, the permutation list `p`, and the array `a`. It then determines the outcome of the game by calling `func_1` for each test case and prints "Bodya" if Bodya wins, "Sasha" if Sasha wins, or "Draw" if neither wins within `k` moves.**
