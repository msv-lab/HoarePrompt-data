You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Function 1: `func_1`
This function takes in the number of elements `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (`PB` and `PS`), the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. It calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function and compares them to determine the winner or if the game is a draw.

### Function 2: `calculate_score`
This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position. It follows the rules of the game:
- It keeps track of the current position and the score.
- It uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles in the permutation.
- If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by considering the full cycles and the remaining steps in the last partial cycle.

### Function 3: `func_2`
This function reads the input from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the result for each one. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`, and calls `func_1` to determine the result.

### Analysis
1. **Cycle Detection**: The `calculate_score` function correctly detects cycles in the permutation. This is important because the game can continue for a very large number of turns (`k` can be up to \(10^9\)), and without cycle detection, the function would run indefinitely.
2. **Score Calculation**: The `calculate_score` function calculates the score correctly by adding the score from the array `a` at each step and handling cycles efficiently.
3. **Comparison**: The `func_1` function correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and determines the winner or if the game is a draw.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles large inputs efficiently by detecting cycles and calculating scores correctly.

Correctness: **True**
