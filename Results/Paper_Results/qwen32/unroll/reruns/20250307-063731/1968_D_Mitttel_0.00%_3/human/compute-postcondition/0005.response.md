The code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. None of the other variables (`data`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `index`, or `t`) are modified. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of these variables except for the newly introduced `results` list.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values split by whitespace; `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are not explicitly assigned new values; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**
