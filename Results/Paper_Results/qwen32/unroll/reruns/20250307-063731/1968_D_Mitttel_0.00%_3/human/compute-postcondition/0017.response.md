The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `remainder_steps`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `remainder_steps`. If `remainder_steps` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, the state includes `steps`, `score`, `current_pos`, `cycle_start`, `visited`, `cycle_length`, `cycle_score`, `cycle_pos`, `remaining_steps`, `full_cycles`, and `remainder_steps`. However, only `remainder_steps` can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

For the loop to execute, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0.

State: **`steps` is either the number of steps taken before a cycle is detected (less than `k`) or `k` if no cycle is detected; `score` is the accumulated score up to the point of cycle detection or after `k` iterations plus `full_cycles * cycle_score`; `current_pos` is the position after the loop terminates; `cycle_start` is the step number where the cycle began if a cycle is detected, otherwise -1; `visited` is a dictionary containing the positions visited and the steps taken to reach them; `cycle_length` is `steps - cycle_start`; `cycle_score` is the sum of the values in the array `a` at the positions `cycle_pos - 1`, `p[cycle_pos - 1] - 1`, ..., up to `cycle_length` iterations; `cycle_pos` is the position after `cycle_length` iterations of following the positions in the array `p`; `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`; `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`; `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0**
