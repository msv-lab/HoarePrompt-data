Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the function `func_1` and `calculate_score` to ensure that both players' scores are calculated accurately over `k` turns, especially considering cycles in the permutation. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly assumes that `calculate_score` is defined in the same scope and that it takes only `start_pos` as an argument. However, `calculate_score` requires additional parameters such as `k`, `p`, and `a`. The correct signature should be `calculate_score(start_pos, k, p, a)`.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - The function `calculate_score` is supposed to calculate the score for a player starting from `start_pos` over `k` turns. However, it only calculates the score for `k` steps without considering the possibility of reaching a cycle before `k` steps. It correctly identifies cycles but does not handle the case where the number of steps before the cycle is less than `k` correctly.
   - The function `calculate_score` does not handle the case where `k` is less than the length of the cycle correctly. It should correctly compute the score for the remaining steps after completing full cycles.
   - The function `calculate_score` does not correctly handle the scenario where the player stays at the same position or moves to a new position based on the permutation `p`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is responsible for reading input and processing multiple test cases. It correctly reads the input and processes each test case, but it relies on the correctness of `func_1` and `calculate_score`.

Here is a corrected version of the `calculate_score` function to address these issues:

```python
def calculate_score(start_pos, k, p, a):
    score = 0
    current_pos = start_pos
    steps = 0
    visited = {}
    cycle_start = -1
    while steps < k:
        if current_pos in visited:
            cycle_start = visited[current_pos]
            break
        visited[current_pos] = steps
        score += a[current_pos - 1]
        steps += 1
        if steps >= k:
            return score
        current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    if cycle_start != -1:
        cycle_length = steps - cycle_start
        cycle_score = 0
        cycle_pos = current_pos
        for _ in range(cycle_length):
            cycle_score += a[cycle_pos - 1]
            cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos - 1]
        remaining_steps = k - steps
        full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
        remainder_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length
        score += full_cycles * cycle_score
        for _ in range(remainder_steps):
            score += a[current_pos - 1]
            current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    return score
```

And the corrected `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):
    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB, k, p, a)
    sasha_score = calculate_score(PS, k, p, a)
    if bodya_score > sasha_score:
        return 'Bodya'
    elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Draw'
```

Given these corrections, the program should now correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. However, the original program does not meet these requirements, so the correctness is **False**.
