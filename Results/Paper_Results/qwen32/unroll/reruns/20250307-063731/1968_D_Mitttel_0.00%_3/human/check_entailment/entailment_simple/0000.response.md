### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the winner of the "Permutation game" between Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions, the permutation, the array of scores, and the number of turns in the game.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input which includes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation and array (`n`), the number of turns (`k`), Bodya's starting position (`PB`), Sasha's starting position (`PS`), the permutation array (`p`), and the score array (`a`).

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The `calculate_score` function is used to compute the score for a player starting from a given position. It handles the scenario where the player might enter a cycle within the permutation.
   - The function keeps track of visited positions using a dictionary (`visited`) to detect cycles. If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the full cycles and the remaining steps within the cycle.

3. **Game Outcome Determination:**
   - The `func_1` function compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and returns the winner or "Draw" if their scores are equal.

4. **Execution Flow:**
   - The `func_2` function orchestrates the reading of input, processing of each test case, and printing of results.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Cycle Detection and Handling:**
  - The program correctly identifies cycles within the permutation and calculates the score for the full cycles and remaining steps. This is crucial for efficiently handling large values of `k` (up to \(10^9\)).

- **Score Calculation:**
  - The score calculation for each player is accurate. It correctly accumulates scores based on the player's position and handles the transition to the next position according to the permutation.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles various edge cases, such as no cycles and cycles starting from the initial position.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The approach is efficient, leveraging cycle detection to avoid unnecessary computations, which is essential given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to be correctly implemented based on the provided problem description and the annotated states of the program. It correctly computes the scores for both players and determines the winner or if the game ends in a draw.

**Correctness: True**
