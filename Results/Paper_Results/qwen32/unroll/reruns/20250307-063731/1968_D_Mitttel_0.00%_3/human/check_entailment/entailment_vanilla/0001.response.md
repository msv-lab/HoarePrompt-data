Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Function 1: `func_1`
This function takes in the number of elements `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (`PB` and `PS`), the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. It calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function and compares them to determine the winner or if the game is a draw.

### Function 2: `calculate_score`
This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position. It follows the rules of the game:
- It keeps track of the current position and the score.
- It uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles in the permutation.
- If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by considering the full cycles and the remaining steps in the last partial cycle.

### Function 3: `func_2`
This function reads the input from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the result for each one. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`, and calls `func_1` to determine the result.

### Analysis
1. **Cycle Detection**: The `calculate_score` function correctly detects cycles in the permutation. This is important because the game can continue for a very large number of turns (`k` can be up to \(10^9\)), and without cycle detection, the function would run indefinitely.
2. **Score Calculation**: The `calculate_score` function calculates the score correctly by adding the score from the array `a` at each step and handling cycles efficiently.
3. **Comparison**: The `func_1` function correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and determines the winner or if the game is a draw.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles large inputs efficiently by detecting cycles and calculating scores correctly.

Correctness: **True**
