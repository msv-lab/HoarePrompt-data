Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and the array), `k` (a positive integer representing the duration of the game), `PB` (a positive integer representing Bodya's starting position), `PS` (a positive integer representing Sasha's starting position), `p` (a list of `n` integers representing the permutation), and `a` (a list of `n` integers representing the array). The function returns the outcome of the game based on the given conditions: if Bodya reaches the end of the permutation before Sasha within `k` moves, it returns "Bodya"; if Sasha reaches the end of the permutation before Bodya within `k` moves, it returns "Sasha"; if neither reaches the end within `k` moves, it returns "Draw".**
