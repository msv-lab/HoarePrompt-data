### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is the main function that handles each test case. It takes the necessary inputs and calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function.
   - It compares the scores and returns the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It iterates up to `k` steps, adding the value of `a` at the current position to the score.
   - It also keeps track of visited positions to detect cycles.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps after completing full cycles and any additional steps.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles the input reading and output printing.
   - It reads all the input data at once, processes each test case, and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis:

- **Cycle Detection**:
  - The `calculate_score` function correctly detects cycles and handles them by calculating the score for the remaining steps after completing full cycles.
  - This is crucial because without cycle detection, the function would potentially run indefinitely if the player enters a cycle.

- **Score Calculation**:
  - The score is calculated correctly by adding the value of `a` at the current position for each step.
  - The function handles both the initial steps before a cycle is detected and the steps within a cycle.

- **Input Handling**:
  - `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
  - It handles the large input size efficiently by reading all the input at once and using list slicing to extract the necessary parts of the input.

- **Output Handling**:
  - The results for each test case are stored and printed correctly.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases, including cycles and large input sizes, and produces the correct output for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
