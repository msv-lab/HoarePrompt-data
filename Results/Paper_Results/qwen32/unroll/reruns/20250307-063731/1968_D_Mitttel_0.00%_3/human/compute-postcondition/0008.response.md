To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for result in results:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `result`, which iterates over the elements in the `results` list. Therefore, the state of `results` is the only one we can adjust to ensure the loop executes.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if and only if the `results` list contains at least one element.
2. **Current State**: The `results` list contains the results of all `t` calls to `func_1`.

### Necessary Adjustment:
To ensure the loop executes, the `results` list must have at least one element. The current state mentions that `results` contains the results of all `t` calls to `func_1`. If `t` is at least 1, then `results` will have at least one element, and the loop will execute.

### State Adjustment:
Since the problem does not specify the value of `t`, we must ensure that `t` is at least 1 to guarantee that `results` has at least one element. However, based on the given state, we assume `results` already holds the results of `t` calls to `func_1`, and we need to ensure `results` is not empty.

### Final State:
State: **`data` remains the same; `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` hold the values from the last iteration; `index` points right after the last list `a` in `data`; `results` is a list containing at least one element**

This ensures that the loop will execute because `results` has at least one element for `result` to iterate over.
