Let's carefully analyze the given program and its functions to ensure they correctly solve the problem as described.

### Function 1: `func_1`
- **Purpose**: This function determines the winner based on the scores calculated for Bodya and Sasha.
- **Implementation**: It calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha and compares the scores.
- **Issues**: The function `calculate_score` is supposed to take `k` as an argument, but `func_1` does not pass `k` to `calculate_score`. This is a critical oversight because `calculate_score` needs to know the number of turns to correctly compute the scores.

### Function 2: `calculate_score`
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position.
- **Implementation**: It correctly handles cycles and efficiently calculates the score for a given number of turns `k`.
- **Issues**: The function `calculate_score` does not receive `k` as an argument from `func_1`, which means it cannot compute the scores correctly for the given number of turns.

### Function 3: `func_2`
- **Purpose**: This function reads input, processes each test case, and prints the result.
- **Implementation**: It correctly reads the input and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
- **Issues**: Since `func_1` does not pass `k` to `calculate_score`, the scores are not computed correctly.

### Analysis
1. **Cycle Detection**: The `calculate_score` function correctly detects cycles, which is crucial for handling large `k`.
2. **Score Calculation**: The `calculate_score` function correctly calculates the score for a given number of turns if `k` is provided. However, since `k` is not passed from `func_1`, the scores are incorrect.
3. **Comparison**: The `func_1` function correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha, but the scores themselves are incorrect due to the missing `k` parameter.

### Conclusion
The program has a critical flaw in the `func_1` function, which does not pass the number of turns `k` to the `calculate_score` function. This results in incorrect score calculations and, consequently, incorrect determination of the winner.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
