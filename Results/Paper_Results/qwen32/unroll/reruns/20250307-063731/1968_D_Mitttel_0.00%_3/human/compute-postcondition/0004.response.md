Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input values split by whitespace; `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are not explicitly assigned new values; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**

In this output state, the value of `index` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
