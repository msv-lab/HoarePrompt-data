n is an integer representing the length of the permutation and array, k is a non-negative integer representing the duration of the game, PB and PS are integers representing Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions respectively, p is a list of n integers representing the permutation, and a is a list of n integers representing the array. It is guaranteed that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^9, 1 <= PB, PS <= n, and the elements of p and a are within the constraints provided in the problem description.
