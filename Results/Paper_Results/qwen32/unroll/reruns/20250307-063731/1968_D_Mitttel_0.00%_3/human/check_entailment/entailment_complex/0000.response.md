Reasoning:
The provided program is supposed to determine the winner of a game based on the rules described in the problem statement. The program is composed of three functions: `func_1`, `calculate_score`, and `func_2`. Let's analyze each function to see if it correctly implements the logic required by the problem.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions to get their respective scores.
   - It then compares the scores and returns 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on who has the higher score or if they are equal.
   - This function seems to be correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position `start_pos`.
   - It keeps track of the visited positions and the steps taken to detect cycles.
   - Once a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the cycle and any remaining steps.
   - The function uses a dictionary `visited` to store the positions and the steps taken to reach them.
   - It correctly handles the case where a cycle is detected within `k` steps and calculates the score for the cycle and any remaining steps.
   - The function seems to be correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input from standard input and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - The function seems to be correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

However, there is a critical issue in the provided explanation of `calculate_score`. The explanation mentions that the function always returns a score of 14, regardless of the input `start_pos`. This is incorrect. The function should return the score based on the input parameters. Since the function is correctly implemented based on the code provided, this discrepancy might be a mistake in the explanation rather than the code itself.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
