Postcondition: **`steps` is either the number of steps taken before a cycle is detected (less than `k`) or `k` if no cycle is detected; `score` is the accumulated score up to the point of cycle detection or after `k` iterations; `current_pos` is the position after the loop terminates; `cycle_start` is the step number where the cycle began if a cycle is detected, otherwise -1; `visited` is a dictionary containing the positions visited and the steps taken to reach them. If `cycle_start` is not -1, then `steps` is 5, `score` is 14, `current_pos` is 4, `cycle_start` is 3, `visited` is {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}, `cycle_length` is 2, `cycle_score` is 7, `cycle_pos` is 1, `remaining_steps` is 3, `full_cycles` is 1, and `remainder_steps` is 1.**
