The function reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it checks a string `s` of length `n`. If `n` is 2, it prints 'YES' only if `s` is '00'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. For `n` greater than 2, it prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in `s` is even and there is not exactly one occurrence of '11'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
