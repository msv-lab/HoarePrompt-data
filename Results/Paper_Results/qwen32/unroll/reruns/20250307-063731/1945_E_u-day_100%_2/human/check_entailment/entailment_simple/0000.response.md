### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

The problem requires us to perform at most 2 swaps on a permutation to ensure that after performing a binary search, the element at the position `l` (final left boundary) is equal to `x`.

The provided program does not implement this correctly. Here are the key issues:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search is performed on the array `arr` without any modifications. The binary search algorithm assumes that the array is sorted, which is not the case here.
   - The program finds the position `pos` of `k` in the array, but it does not use this information to perform swaps.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program does not perform any swaps. If the binary search does not find `k` at the correct position, it simply prints one swap operation to move the correct element to the appropriate position.
   - The program does not consider the possibility of performing two swaps to achieve the desired result.

3. **Output**:
   - If the element `k` is found at the correct position after the binary search, the program correctly prints `0` indicating no swaps.
   - If the element `k` is not found at the correct position, the program prints `1` and suggests a swap operation. However, this swap might not be sufficient to ensure that the binary search ends with `p_l` equal to `x`.

### Correctness:

Given the above points, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to perform at most 2 swaps to ensure the binary search ends with `p_l` equal to `x`. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
