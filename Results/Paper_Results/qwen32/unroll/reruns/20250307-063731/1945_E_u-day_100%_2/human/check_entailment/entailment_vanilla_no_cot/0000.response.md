Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the described problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search is performed on the unsorted permutation, which is not guaranteed to work correctly. The problem statement specifies that binary search can be applied only after the permutation has been rearranged to ensure that `p_l` equals `x` at the end of the binary search.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The program does not attempt to perform any swaps to rearrange the permutation. It only checks if the element at the final `low` index after binary search is equal to `x` and prints the result accordingly. However, it does not perform any swaps to achieve this condition, which is a key part of the problem.

3. **Output Format**: The program does not correctly handle the output format. It should output the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped if necessary.

To fix the program, you need to implement a strategy to perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that the binary search will end with `p_l` equal to `x`. This might involve finding the position of `x` and ensuring that it can be reached through binary search after rearranging the array with at most 2 swaps.
