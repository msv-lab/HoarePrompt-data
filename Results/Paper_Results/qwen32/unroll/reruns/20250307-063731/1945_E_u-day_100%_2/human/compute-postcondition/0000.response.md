To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1()` does. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we will assume that `func_1()` returns a tuple of two values, where the first value is assigned to `n` and the second value is assigned to `k`. The values returned by `func_1()` will replace the initial values of `n` and `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation.
- `k` is a positive integer representing the number to be found in the permutation.
- `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of length `n`.
- `pos` is an integer representing the position of `k` in `arr` (if found).
- `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm.
- `st` is a set used to store `mid` values during the binary search.

The code snippet:
```
n, k = func_1()
```

This line of code will change the values of `n` and `k` to whatever `func_1()` returns. The other variables (`arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st`) will remain unchanged.

Let's assume `func_1()` returns a tuple `(new_n, new_k)`. After executing the code, the output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is `new_n`, `k` is `new_k`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of length `n`, `pos` is an integer representing the position of `k` in `arr` (if found), `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to store `mid` values during the binary search.**

In natural language: The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`. All other variables remain unchanged.
