To determine the output state after the loop completes, we need to analyze the loop's behavior. The loop iterates `n` times, checking if each element in the array `arr` at index `i` is equal to `k`. If such an element is found, the variable `pos` is set to the index `i` of that element.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:

1. **Element Found**: If `k` is found in `arr` at any index `i`, `pos` will be set to that index `i`.
2. **Element Not Found**: If `k` is not found in `arr` after all iterations, `pos` will remain `-1`.

Since the loop does not modify any other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `low`, `high`, `st`), their values remain unchanged.

**Output State:**
- `n` remains `new_n`.
- `k` remains `new_k`.
- `arr` remains the value returned by `func_2()`.
- `pos` is either the index `i` where `arr[i] == k` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`.
- `low` remains the initial integer representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm.
- `high` remains the initial integer representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm.
- `st` remains the initial set used to store `mid` values during the binary search.

Output State: **`n` is `new_n`, `k` is `new_k`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index `i` where `arr[i] == k` or `-1` if `k` is not found, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to store `mid` values during the binary search.**
