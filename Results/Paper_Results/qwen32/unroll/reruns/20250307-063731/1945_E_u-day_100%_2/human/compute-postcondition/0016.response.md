Functionality: **The function `func_3` performs a binary search on a permutation list `arr` to find the position of the integer `k`. It prints `0` if `k` is found in the list, otherwise it prints `1` followed by the 1-based index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k` and the 1-based index where `k` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.**
