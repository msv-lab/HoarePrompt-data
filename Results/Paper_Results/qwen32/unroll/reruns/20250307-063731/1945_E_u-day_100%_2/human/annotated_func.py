#State of the program right berfore the function call: No specific variables are present in the function signature, but based on the context, the function `func_1` is expected to read input from the standard input, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers `n` and `x`, followed by a permutation `p` of length `n`. The function is expected to return a map object that contains the integers read from the input.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers read from the standard input. This map object will convert each element of the input string, which is split by spaces, into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it by spaces, and returns a map object that contains each element converted to an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_2` does not take any parameters and returns a list. The list returned is the result of calling another function `func_1` and converting its result to a list.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of converting the result of `func_1()` to a list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not take any parameters and returns a list, which is the result of converting the output of `func_1()` to a list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is a positive integer representing the number to be found in the permutation, arr is a list of integers representing the permutation of length n, pos is an integer representing the position of k in arr (if found), low and high are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and st is a set used to store mid values during the binary search.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: - `n` remains `new_n`.
    #- `k` remains `new_k`.
    #- `arr` remains the value returned by `func_2()`.
    #- `pos` is either the index `i` where `arr[i] == k` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`.
    #- `low` remains the initial integer representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm.
    #- `high` remains the initial integer representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm.
    #- `st` remains the initial set used to store `mid` values during the binary search.
    #
    #Output State:
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: low is the largest index such that arr[low] <= k or the last index if all elements are <= k; high is the smallest index such that arr[high] > k or out of bounds; st contains all mid values checked during the loop.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: low + 1, pos + 1 (where low + 1 is the 1-based index of the largest element in arr that is less than or equal to k, and pos + 1 is the 1-based index where k would be inserted to maintain the sorted order)
    #State: `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k` or the last index if all elements are <= k; `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k` or out of bounds; `st` contains all mid values checked during the loop. If `arr[low]` equals `k`, then `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` performs a binary search on a permutation list `arr` to find the position of the integer `k`. It prints `0` if `k` is found in the list, otherwise it prints `1` followed by the 1-based index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k` and the 1-based index where `k` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
