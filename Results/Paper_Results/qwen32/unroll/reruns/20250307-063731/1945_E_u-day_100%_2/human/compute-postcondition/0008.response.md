Let's analyze the given loop and determine the output state after it has finished executing.

The loop is a binary search implementation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `low` is initialized to `0`.
   - `high` is initialized to `n`.
   - `st` (a set) is initialized to be empty.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop continues as long as `low + 1 < high`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - `mid` is calculated as the integer division of `(low + high) // 2`.
   - `mid` is added to the set `st`.
   - If `arr[mid] > k`, `high` is set to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, `low` is set to `mid`.

The loop terminates when `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`, meaning `low` and `high` are adjacent indices. At this point, `low` will point to the largest index where `arr[low] <= k`, and `high` will be the smallest index where `arr[high] > k` (or out of bounds if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`).

**Output State Analysis**:
- `low` will be the index of the last element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k` or the last element if all elements are less than or equal to `k`.
- `high` will be the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `k` or out of bounds if all elements are less than or equal to `k`.
- `st` will contain all the `mid` values that were checked during the binary search.
- `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's logic.

Output State: **low is the largest index such that arr[low] <= k or the last index if all elements are <= k; high is the smallest index such that arr[high] > k or out of bounds; st contains all mid values checked during the loop.**
