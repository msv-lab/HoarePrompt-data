Let's analyze the provided initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k` or the last index if all elements are `<= k`.
2. `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k` or out of bounds.
3. `st` contains all `mid` values checked during the loop.
4. `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is `print(1)`. This statement is independent of the initial state described. It simply prints the integer `1`.

### Output:
The code will print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
