Reasoning:
The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation using at most two swaps so that after performing a binary search, the element at the found position `l` is equal to `x`.

The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Let's break down the provided functions:

1. `func_1()` reads a line of input and splits it into integers. This function works correctly.
2. `func_2()` calls `func_1()` and converts the result to a list, which is also correct.
3. `func_3()` is the main function that processes each test case. It reads the values of `n` and `x`, then the permutation `arr`. It then searches for the position of `x` in `arr` and performs a binary search. However, it does not attempt to rearrange the array to make sure that after the binary search, `arr[low]` equals `x`. Instead, it only prints the number of swaps needed and the indices to swap, which is not correctly implemented.

The current implementation only checks if `x` is in the array and suggests a single swap if it's not found, but it does not guarantee that after the binary search, `arr[low]` will be `x`. The binary search logic is also flawed because it does not account for the possibility of needing two swaps to achieve the correct position.

The code does not correctly handle the requirement to rearrange the array with at most two swaps to ensure the binary search lands on `x`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
