The provided code snippet contains a `print(0)` statement. This statement is independent of the variables `low`, `high`, `arr`, `k`, and `st` as described in the initial state. The `print(0)` statement will simply output the integer `0`.

Here's the breakdown:

- `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k` or the last index if all elements are <= k, and `arr[low]` equals `k`.
- `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k` or out of bounds.
- `st` contains all mid values checked during the loop.

None of these variables are used in the `print(0)` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is solely determined by the statement itself.

Output: **0**
