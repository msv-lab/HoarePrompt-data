The code snippet provided initializes an empty set `st`. This action only affects the variable `st`, setting it to an empty set, while all other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` remains `new_n`; `k` remains `new_k`; `arr` remains the value returned by `func_2()`; `pos` is either the index `i` where `arr[i] == k` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is `0`; `high` is `n`; `st` is an empty set.**
