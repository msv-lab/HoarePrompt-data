To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `low + 1 < high`.

Given the current state:
- `low` is `0`
- `high` is `n`

The condition `low + 1 < high` translates to `0 + 1 < n`, which simplifies to `1 < n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `1`.

No other variables in the loop head (`low` and `high`) need to be adjusted as their current values are sufficient to determine the condition based on `n`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than `1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `k` remains `new_k`; `arr` remains the value returned by `func_2()`; `pos` is either the index `i` where `arr[i] == k` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is `0`; `high` is `n`; `st` is an empty set.**
