Postcondition: **`low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k` or the last index if all elements are <= k; `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k` or out of bounds; `st` contains all mid values checked during the loop. If `arr[low]` equals `k`, then `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.**
