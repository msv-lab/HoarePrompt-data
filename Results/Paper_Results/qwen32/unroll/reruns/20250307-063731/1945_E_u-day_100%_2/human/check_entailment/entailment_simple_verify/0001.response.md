### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We have a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
- We can perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search correctly identify `x` at position `l` at the end.
- Binary search will be performed on the array after the swaps.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and then reads the permutation `p`.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The program correctly identifies the position `pos` of `x` in the array `arr`.

3. **Binary Search Execution:**
   - The binary search is executed, and the positions visited are stored in a set `st`.
   - The variables `low` and `high` are initialized to `0` and `n` respectively.
   - The loop continues until `r - l = 1`.
   - The midpoint `m` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
   - Depending on the value of `arr[m]` compared to `x`, `l` or `r` is updated.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - If `arr[low] == x` after the binary search, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` and suggests swapping `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Swapping Logic:**
  - The program only considers one swap if `arr[low] != x`.
  - However, the problem allows up to 2 swaps, and the solution might require two swaps to correctly position `x` for binary search to find it.
  - The current implementation does not account for the possibility of needing a second swap.

- **Handling of Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_3()` for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- Given the above points, the program is not fully correct because it does not handle the possibility of needing two swaps.
- The program correctly identifies the position of `x` and performs the binary search as described.
- However, it does not ensure that `x` is found at the correct position `l` after the binary search if only one swap is not sufficient.

### Conclusion:
The program does not fully meet the problem requirements, especially the part about potentially needing two swaps.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
