Output State: **`n` is `new_n`, `k` is `new_k`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to store `mid` values during the binary search.**

In this output state, the value of `pos` has been updated to -1, indicating that the position of `k` in `arr` has not been found or is being reset. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
