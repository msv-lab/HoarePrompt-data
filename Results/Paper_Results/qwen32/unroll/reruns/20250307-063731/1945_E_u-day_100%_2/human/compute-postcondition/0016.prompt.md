You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is a positive integer representing the number to be found in the permutation, arr is a list of integers representing the permutation of length n, pos is an integer representing the position of k in arr (if found), low and high are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and st is a set used to store mid values during the binary search.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: - `n` remains `new_n`.
    #- `k` remains `new_k`.
    #- `arr` remains the value returned by `func_2()`.
    #- `pos` is either the index `i` where `arr[i] == k` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`.
    #- `low` remains the initial integer representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm.
    #- `high` remains the initial integer representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm.
    #- `st` remains the initial set used to store `mid` values during the binary search.
    #
    #Output State:
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: low is the largest index such that arr[low] <= k or the last index if all elements are <= k; high is the smallest index such that arr[high] > k or out of bounds; st contains all mid values checked during the loop.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: low + 1, pos + 1 (where low + 1 is the 1-based index of the largest element in arr that is less than or equal to k, and pos + 1 is the 1-based index where k would be inserted to maintain the sorted order)
    #State: `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k` or the last index if all elements are <= k; `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k` or out of bounds; `st` contains all mid values checked during the loop. If `arr[low]` equals `k`, then `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_3` does not explicitly accept any parameters as they are defined within its scope. It performs a binary search on a permutation list `arr` of length `n` to find the position of the integer `k`. If `k` is found within the specified search range defined by `low` and `high`, it returns the position `pos` of `k` in `arr`. If `k` is not found, it returns a value indicating that `k` is not present in the list. The set `st` is used to store mid values during the binary search process to potentially avoid redundant calculations or for other purposes.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
