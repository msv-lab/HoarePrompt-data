The code snippet `arr = func_2()` updates the value of `arr` to whatever `func_2()` returns. The values of other variables like `n`, `k`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st` remain unchanged unless `func_2()` modifies them as part of its return value, which is not indicated in the given context. Therefore, we assume only `arr` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is `new_n`, `k` is `new_k`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is an integer representing the position of `k` in `arr` (if found), `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to store `mid` values during the binary search.**
