To determine the output of the `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` statement, we need to understand the context provided by the initial state:

1. **low**: This is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`. If all elements in `arr` are less than or equal to `k`, then `low` will be the last index of the list.
2. **high**: This is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`. If no such index exists, `high` will be out of bounds (which typically means `len(arr)`).
3. **st**: This is a list that contains all `mid` values checked during a loop, presumably a binary search loop.
4. **arr[low] != k**: This indicates that the element at the `low` index is not equal to `k`.

The `print` statement is `print(low + 1, pos + 1)`. Here, `pos` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to assume it is a variable that is used in the context of the loop or the binary search process. Since `pos` is not defined in the initial state, we can infer that `pos` might be another variable used in the binary search algorithm, possibly the index where `k` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

Given the information, we can describe the output as follows:

- `low + 1`: This will be the position (1-based index) of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`.
- `pos + 1`: This will be the position (1-based index) where `k` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order, or the position of the first element greater than `k` if `k` is not present in the list.

Since `pos` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only describe it in terms of its role in the binary search context.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **low + 1, pos + 1 (where low + 1 is the 1-based index of the largest element in arr that is less than or equal to k, and pos + 1 is the 1-based index where k would be inserted to maintain the sorted order)**
