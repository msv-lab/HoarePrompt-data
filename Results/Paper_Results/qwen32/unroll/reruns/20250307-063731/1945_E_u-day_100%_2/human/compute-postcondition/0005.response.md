Initial State: 
- `n` remains `new_n`.
- `k` remains `new_k`.
- `arr` remains the value returned by `func_2()`.
- `pos` is either the index `i` where `arr[i] == k` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`.
- `low` remains the initial integer representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm.
- `high` remains the initial integer representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm.
- `st` remains the initial set used to store `mid` values during the binary search.

The code snippet is:
```python
low, high = 0, n
```

Impact of the code on the program:
- The variable `low` is set to `0`.
- The variable `high` is set to `n`.

Other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `st`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains `new_n`; `k` remains `new_k`; `arr` remains the value returned by `func_2()`; `pos` is either the index `i` where `arr[i] == k` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is `0`; `high` is `n`; `st` remains the initial set used to store `mid` values during the binary search.**
