You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No specific variables are present in the function signature, but based on the context, the function `func_1` is expected to read input from the standard input, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers `n` and `x`, followed by a permutation `p` of length `n`. The function is expected to return a map object that contains the integers read from the input.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers read from the standard input. This map object will convert each element of the input string, which is split by spaces, into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it by spaces, and returns a map object that contains each element converted to an integer.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_2` does not take any parameters and returns a list. The list returned is the result of calling another function `func_1` and converting its result to a list.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of converting the result of `func_1()` to a list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not take any parameters and returns a list, which is the result of converting the output of `func_1()` to a list.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is a positive integer representing the number to be found in the permutation, arr is a list of integers representing the permutation of length n, pos is an integer representing the position of k in arr (if found), low and high are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and st is a set used to store mid values during the binary search.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()

    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:

    #State: - `n` remains `new_n`.
    #- `k` remains `new_k`.
    #- `arr` remains the value returned by `func_2()`.
    #- `pos` is either the index `i` where `arr[i] == k` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`.
    #- `low` remains the initial integer representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm.
    #- `high` remains the initial integer representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm.
    #- `st` remains the initial set used to store `mid` values during the binary search.

        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:

        #This is printed: low + 1, pos + 1 (where low + 1 is the 1-based index of the largest element in arr that is less than or equal to k, and pos + 1 is the 1-based index where k would be inserted to maintain the sorted order)
    #State: `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k` or the last index if all elements are <= k; `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k` or out of bounds; `st` contains all mid values checked during the loop. If `arr[low]` equals `k`, then `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` performs a binary search on a permutation list `arr` to find the position of the integer `k`. It prints `0` if `k` is found in the list, otherwise it prints `1` followed by the 1-based index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k` and the 1-based index where `k` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
   - We can perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search correctly identify `x` at position `l` at the end.
   - Binary search will be performed on the array after the swaps.

2. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search logic is implemented correctly in the code.
   - The variables `l` and `r` are initialized to `0` and `n` respectively.
   - The loop continues until `r - l = 1`.
   - The midpoint `m` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
   - Depending on the value of `arr[m]` compared to `x`, `l` or `r` is updated.
   - The goal is to have `arr[l] == x` after the binary search.

3. **Identifying the Position of `x`:**
   - The program first identifies the position `pos` of `x` in the array `arr`.

4. **Binary Search Execution:**
   - The binary search is executed, and the positions visited are stored in a set `st`.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - If `arr[low] == x` after the binary search, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` and suggests swapping `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Swapping Logic:**
  - The program only considers one swap if `arr[low] != x`.
  - However, the problem allows up to 2 swaps, and the solution might require two swaps to correctly position `x` for binary search to find it.
  
- **Handling of Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The function `func_3()` does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It should be called multiple times for each test case, but the current implementation does not loop over the number of test cases `t`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- Given the above points, the program is not fully correct because it does not handle the possibility of needing two swaps and does not correctly manage multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the problem requirements, especially the part about potentially needing two swaps and handling multiple test cases correctly.
