No specific variables are present in the function signature, but based on the context, the function `func_1` is expected to read input from the standard input, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers `n` and `x`, followed by a permutation `p` of length `n`. The function is expected to return a map object that contains the integers read from the input.
