Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
   - We can perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search correctly identify `x` at position `l` at the end.
   - Binary search will be performed on the array after the swaps.

2. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search logic is implemented correctly in the code.
   - The variables `l` and `r` are initialized to `0` and `n` respectively.
   - The loop continues until `r - l = 1`.
   - The midpoint `m` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
   - Depending on the value of `arr[m]` compared to `x`, `l` or `r` is updated.
   - The goal is to have `arr[l] == x` after the binary search.

3. **Identifying the Position of `x`:**
   - The program first identifies the position `pos` of `x` in the array `arr`.

4. **Binary Search Execution:**
   - The binary search is executed, and the positions visited are stored in a set `st`.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - If `arr[low] == x` after the binary search, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` and suggests swapping `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Swapping Logic:**
  - The program only considers one swap if `arr[low] != x`.
  - However, the problem allows up to 2 swaps, and the solution might require two swaps to correctly position `x` for binary search to find it.
  
- **Handling of Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The function `func_3()` does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It should be called multiple times for each test case, but the current implementation does not loop over the number of test cases `t`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- Given the above points, the program is not fully correct because it does not handle the possibility of needing two swaps and does not correctly manage multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the problem requirements, especially the part about potentially needing two swaps and handling multiple test cases correctly.
