Functionality: **The function `func_3` does not explicitly accept any parameters as they are defined within its scope. It performs a binary search on a permutation list `arr` of length `n` to find the position of the integer `k`. If `k` is found within the specified search range defined by `low` and `high`, it returns the position `pos` of `k` in `arr`. If `k` is not found, it returns a value indicating that `k` is not present in the list. The set `st` is used to store mid values during the binary search process to potentially avoid redundant calculations or for other purposes.**
