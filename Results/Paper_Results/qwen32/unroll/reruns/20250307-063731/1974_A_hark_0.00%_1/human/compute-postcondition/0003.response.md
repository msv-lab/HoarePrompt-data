Functionality: **The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It returns an integer `t` such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.**

However, based on the provided information, it seems there might be a misunderstanding since the function definition `def func_3():` does not indicate any parameter, but the output description suggests it should return something related to `t`. If `t` is meant to be an input parameter, the function definition should reflect that. Given the current definition, the function does not accept any parameters, and the output description does not align with the function signature. Assuming the function should accept `t` as a parameter, the corrected functionality would be:

Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts an integer parameter `t` such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. It returns the integer `t`.**
