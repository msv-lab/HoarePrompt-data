To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    func_2()
```

The loop iterates `t` times, and during each iteration, it calls the function `func_2()`. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a throwaway variable that we don't plan to use inside the loop.

The initial state provided is that `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`.

Since the loop does not modify the value of `t` and there is no information given about the contents of `func_2()` affecting `t`, the value of `t` remains unchanged after the loop completes.

The output state will reflect the fact that `t` has not changed.

Output State: **`t` is still an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, with `t` being the same integer value from the input.**
