Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.**

The function `func_3` itself does not include the variables `x` and `y` in its signature, but based on the problem description and the context, `x` and `y` are integers representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively, for each test case. However, since these variables are not part of the function signature `func_3`, they are not included in the precondition for this specific function.

If we were to describe the precondition for a function that takes `x` and `y` as parameters, it would be:

Precondition: **x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.**
