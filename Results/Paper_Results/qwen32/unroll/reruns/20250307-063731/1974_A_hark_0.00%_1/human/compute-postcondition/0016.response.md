Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers provided in the input, where 0 <= `x` <= 99 and 0 <= `y` <= 99. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is `0` if `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4 <= 0` else `math.ceil((x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4) / 15) + 1`. If at least one of `x` or `y` is 0, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.**
