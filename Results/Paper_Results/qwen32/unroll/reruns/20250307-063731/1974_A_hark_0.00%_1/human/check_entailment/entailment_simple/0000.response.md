Let's analyze the program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens needed to place x 1x1 icons and y 2x2 icons. The key point is to efficiently place 2x2 icons first because they occupy 4 cells each and then place the remaining 1x1 icons.

The given program consists of three functions:

1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function simply returns the smaller of the two integers `a` and `b`. This function is not used anywhere in the program, so it can be ignored for our analysis.

2. **func_2()**: This function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input and calculates the minimum number of screens needed. It handles different cases based on the values of `x` and `y`.

3. **func_3()**: This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_2()` for each test case.

Let's examine the logic in `func_2()`:

- If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
  - It calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`. This represents the minimum number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons because each screen can fit at most two 2x2 icons.
  - It updates `x` to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This step is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons. It should subtract the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons from `x` and then calculate the remaining 1x1 icons.
  - It calculates `bxsfory1` as `0` if the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is `math.ceil((updated x) / 15) + 1`. This step is also incorrect because it incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
  - It prints `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.

- If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
  - It correctly calculates and prints `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

- If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
  - It correctly calculates and prints `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

- If both `x` and `y` are 0:
  - It correctly prints `0`.

The logic for handling cases where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0 is incorrect. The program does not correctly account for the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons and incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
