Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for all cases. Let's analyze the logic and identify a potential issue.

The main logic is in `func_2`:
1. It calculates `bxsfory` as the minimum number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons.
2. It then tries to fit the remaining 1x1 icons into the remaining space.
3. The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect and does not properly account for the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons.

Let's consider a test case:
- Input: `x = 14`, `y = 1`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: `3`

Explanation of the issue:
- For `y = 1`, `bxsfory` is `1` (since `math.ceil(1 / 2)` is `1`).
- After placing one 2x2 icon, 11 cells are occupied, leaving 4 cells free.
- The remaining `x` is calculated as `14 - 1 * 15 + 1 * 4 = -1`. This is incorrect because it doesn't properly account for the remaining space.
- The program then calculates `bxsfory1` as `math.ceil(-1 / 15) + 1`, which is `1`.
- The total number of screens is `1 + 1 = 2`, but the program outputs `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect because it doesn't properly account for the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons. The correct approach should consider the actual number of free cells after placing 2x2 icons and then see how many 1x1 icons can fit into those cells.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
