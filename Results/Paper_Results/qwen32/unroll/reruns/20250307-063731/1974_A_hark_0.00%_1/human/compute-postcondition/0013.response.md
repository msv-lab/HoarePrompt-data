The `print(0)` statement in the Python code snippet will print the integer `0`. The values of the variables `x` and `y` do not affect the output of this statement because the `print` function is explicitly instructed to print the integer `0`.

Given the initial state, we know that `x` and `y` are integers within the range 0 to 99, and at least one of them is 0, but they cannot both be non-zero simultaneously. However, since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output `0`, the values of `x` and `y` do not influence the output.

Output: **0**
