Given the initial state:
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99.
- The `math.ceil` function will be used to compute the ceiling of `y / 2`.

Let's break down the print statement:
- `y / 2` computes the division of `y` by 2, which will result in a floating-point number.
- `math.ceil(y / 2)` computes the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

Since `y` is a positive integer (greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99), `y / 2` will be a positive floating-point number. The `math.ceil` function will round this number up to the nearest integer.

To provide a precise description:
- If `y` is an even number, `y / 2` will be an integer, and `math.ceil(y / 2)` will return the same integer.
- If `y` is an odd number, `y / 2` will be a floating-point number with a fractional part, and `math.ceil(y / 2)` will return the next integer.

Given that the exact value of `y` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `y`.

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99)**
