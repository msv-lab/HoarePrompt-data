### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the program and compare it to the problem requirements.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is not used anywhere in the program, so we can ignore it for our analysis.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input.
   - It calculates the minimum number of screens required based on the following logic:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
       - It calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`, which represents the minimum number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons.
       - It then adjusts `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15` and adding `y * 4` (which seems incorrect based on the problem description).
       - It then calculates `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of the adjusted `x` divided by 15 plus 1.
       - Finally, it prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
     - If only `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `y / 2`.
     - If only `x` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It calls `func_2` `t` times, which means it processes each test case using the logic in `func_2`.

### Issues in the Logic:
- The calculation of `bxsfory1` seems incorrect. The logic for adjusting `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15` and adding `y * 4` does not make sense in the context of the problem.
- The formula for placing 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons is incorrect. The correct approach should be to first place as many 2x2 icons as possible and then fill the remaining space with 1x1 icons.

### Correct Approach:
- Place as many 2x2 icons as possible on each screen.
- After placing 2x2 icons, fill the remaining space with 1x1 icons.
- Each screen can fit a maximum of 6 2x2 icons (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells and a 5x3 screen has 15 cells, the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit is 3, but we need to consider the arrangement).
- The remaining cells can be filled with 1x1 icons.

### Correct Implementation:
The correct implementation should look something like this:

```python
import math

def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    screens = 0
    
    # Place 2x2 icons
    screens += y // 2
    if y % 2 != 0:
        screens += 1
        x -= 4  # One 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells
    
    # Place 1x1 icons
    remaining_cells = 15 - (y // 2) * 4 - (y % 2) * 4
    if x > remaining_cells:
        screens += math.ceil(x / 15)
    else:
        pass  # No need for additional screens
    
    print(screens)

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_3()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided `func_2` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
