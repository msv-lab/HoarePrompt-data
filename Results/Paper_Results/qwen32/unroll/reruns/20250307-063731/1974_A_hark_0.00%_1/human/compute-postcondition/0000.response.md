The code snippet `t = int(input())` will reassign the value of `t` to whatever integer is provided by the input. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, but after the execution of the code, `t` will be whatever integer the input provides, still within the bounds of the initial precondition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, with `t` being the integer value from the input.**
