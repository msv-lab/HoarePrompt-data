Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for the given problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `x` after placing `2x2` icons:**
   The line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. After placing `y` number of `2x2` icons, the remaining `x` should be reduced by the number of `1x1` cells occupied by these `2x2` icons, which is `y * 4`. However, the `+ y * 4` part is incorrect and should be `- y * 4`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining `1x1` Icons:**
   The logic `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is incorrect. The `+ 1` part is unnecessary and incorrect. The number of screens needed for the remaining `1x1` icons should simply be `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

3. **General Approach:**
   The general approach of the program is flawed. It doesn't consider the optimal placement of `2x2` icons and `1x1` icons on the grid. The program should try to maximize the use of `2x2` icons first and then place the remaining `1x1` icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def min_screens(x, y):
    # Each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells
    # Each screen is 5x3 = 15 cells
    screens = 0
    
    # Place 2x2 icons first
    screens += y
    x -= y * 4
    
    # Place remaining 1x1 icons
    if x > 0:
        screens += math.ceil(x / 15)
    
    return screens

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        print(min_screens(x, y))

main()
```

This corrected program first places all `2x2` icons and then places the remaining `1x1` icons, ensuring the minimum number of screens is used.
