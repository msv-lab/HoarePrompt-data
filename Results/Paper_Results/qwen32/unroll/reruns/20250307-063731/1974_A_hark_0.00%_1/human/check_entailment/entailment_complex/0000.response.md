### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct.

**Problem Summary:**
- We need to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid.
- We need to find the minimum number of 5x3 grids required to place all the icons.
- A 5x3 grid has 15 cells.
- A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.

**Logic Analysis:**

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function simply returns the smaller of two integers.
   - It is not used anywhere in the provided code, so it seems unnecessary for the current problem.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads two integers `x` and `y` from input.
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
     - Calculate `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`. This is the minimum number of screens needed to place all 2x2 icons.
     - Update `x` to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This step seems incorrect because it doesn't correctly account for the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons. It subtracts 15 for each 2x2 icon (which is incorrect) and adds 4 times `y` (which doesn't make sense in this context).
     - Calculate `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of the updated `x / 15` plus 1 if `x` is still positive. This step is also incorrect because it doesn't correctly account for the remaining space.
     - Print the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
   - If only `y` is greater than 0:
     - Print the ceiling of `y / 2`.
   - If only `x` is greater than 0:
     - Print the ceiling of `x / 15`.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
     - Print 0.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - Reads an integer `t` from input, representing the number of test cases.
   - Calls `func_2` `t` times.

**Correctness Analysis:**

- The logic for handling cases where only `x` or `y` is greater than 0 seems correct.
- However, the logic for handling cases where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0 is flawed. The update to `x` and the calculation of `bxsfory1` do not correctly account for the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons.

Let's consider an example:
- For `x = 7` and `y = 2`:
  - 2x2 icons require 2 screens (since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells and we can place at most 3 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid).
  - After placing 2 2x2 icons, we have 15 - 8 = 7 cells left.
  - We need to place 7 1x1 icons, which can fit in one 5x3 grid.
  - Total screens required: 2 + 1 = 3.
- However, the current implementation would incorrectly calculate the number of screens required.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
