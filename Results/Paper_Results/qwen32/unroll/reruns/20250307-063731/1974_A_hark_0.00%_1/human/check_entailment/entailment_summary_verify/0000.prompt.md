You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and calls `func_2` exactly `t` times. It does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for all cases. Let's analyze the logic and identify a potential issue.

The main logic is in `func_2`:
1. It calculates `bxsfory` as the minimum number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons.
2. It then tries to fit the remaining 1x1 icons into the remaining space.
3. The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect and does not properly account for the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons.

Let's consider a test case:
- Input: `x = 14`, `y = 1`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: `3`

Explanation of the issue:
- For `y = 1`, `bxsfory` is `1` (since `math.ceil(1 / 2)` is `1`).
- After placing one 2x2 icon, 11 cells are occupied, leaving 4 cells free.
- The remaining `x` is calculated as `14 - 1 * 15 + 1 * 4 = -1`. This is incorrect because it doesn't properly account for the remaining space.
- The program then calculates `bxsfory1` as `math.ceil(-1 / 15) + 1`, which is `1`.
- The total number of screens is `1 + 1 = 2`, but the program outputs `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect because it doesn't properly account for the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons. The correct approach should consider the actual number of free cells after placing 2x2 icons and then see how many 1x1 icons can fit into those cells.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
