You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem of finding the minimum number of screens required to place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Grid Size and Icon Placement**:
   - The grid is 5x3, which means it has 15 cells.
   - A 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
   - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.

2. **Optimal Placement Strategy**:
   - We need to place as many 2x2 icons as possible first because they occupy more space and thus reduce the number of screens needed.
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, we place the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - Since each screen can hold a maximum of 15 cells, we need to calculate how many screens are required based on the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

3. **Logic in the Program**:
   - The program defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
   - `func_1` is defined but not used in the program.
   - `func_2` handles the logic for a single test case.
     - It reads the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
     - If both types of icons are present (`x > 0` and `y > 0`):
       - It calculates the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (`bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`).
       - It then adjusts the number of 1x1 icons based on the space occupied by the 2x2 icons (`x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`). This adjustment seems incorrect as it does not properly account for the space occupied by the 2x2 icons.
       - It calculates the screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`).
       - It prints the total number of screens (`bxsfory1 + bxsfory`).
     - If only 1x1 icons are present (`x > 0` and `y == 0`):
       - It calculates the screens needed (`print(math.ceil(x / 15))`).
     - If only 2x2 icons are present (`x == 0` and `y > 0`):
       - It calculates the screens needed (`print(math.ceil(y / 2))`).
     - If no icons are present (`x == 0` and `y == 0`):
       - It prints `0`.
   - `func_3` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_2` for each test case.

4. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program fails to correctly account for the space occupied by 2x2 icons when adjusting the number of 1x1 icons.
   - The logic for adjusting the number of 1x1 icons (`x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`) is flawed because it incorrectly reduces the number of 1x1 icons by multiplying `bxsfory` (number of screens for 2x2 icons) by 15 (total cells in a screen) and then adding `y * 4` (total cells occupied by 2x2 icons).
   - The correct approach should be to calculate the total occupied cells by 2x2 icons and then determine the remaining space for 1x1 icons.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required due to an incorrect adjustment of the number of 1x1 icons.

Correctness: **False**
