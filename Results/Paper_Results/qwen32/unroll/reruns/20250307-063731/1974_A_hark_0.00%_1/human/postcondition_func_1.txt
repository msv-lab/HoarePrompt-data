The function reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` (where 0 <= `x` <= 99 and 0 <= `y` <= 99) from the input. It then calculates and prints a value based on the conditions: if both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it computes a specific formula; if only `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `y / 2`; if only `x` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`; and if both are 0, it prints 0.
