### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summaries to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- **Grid Size:** 5x3 grid, which gives 15 cells per screen.
- **Icon Types:**
  - 1x1 icons occupy 1 cell each.
  - 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells each.
- **Objective:** Place all icons on the minimum number of screens.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:** 
   - This function is defined but not used in the program. It simply returns the minimum of two numbers. This function does not affect the logic of the program.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function handles the logic for a single test case.
   - It reads the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) and 2x2 icons (`y`).
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:**
     - It calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons (`bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`). This is correct because each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons.
     - The next line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. The logic here is flawed because it incorrectly adjusts the number of 1x1 icons. Specifically, it subtracts `bxsfory * 15` (which is the total number of cells in `bxsfory` screens) and adds `y * 4` (the total number of cells occupied by `y` 2x2 icons). This adjustment does not correctly account for the space occupied by the 2x2 icons.
     - It then calculates the screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`). This step is also flawed due to the incorrect adjustment of `x`.
     - Finally, it prints the total number of screens (`bxsfory1 + bxsfory`).
   - **Case 2: Only 1x1 icons (`x > 0` and `y == 0`):**
     - It correctly calculates the number of screens needed (`print(math.ceil(x / 15))`).
   - **Case 3: Only 2x2 icons (`x == 0` and `y > 0`):**
     - It correctly calculates the number of screens needed (`print(math.ceil(y / 2))`).
   - **Case 4: No icons (`x == 0` and `y == 0`):**
     - It correctly prints `0`.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases (`t`) and calls `func_2` for each test case. This part is correct.

#### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly handles the case where both 1x1 and 2x2 icons are present. The logic for adjusting the number of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons is flawed. Specifically, the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` does not correctly account for the space occupied by the 2x2 icons.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the flawed logic in handling the case with both 1x1 and 2x2 icons, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

Final: **False**
