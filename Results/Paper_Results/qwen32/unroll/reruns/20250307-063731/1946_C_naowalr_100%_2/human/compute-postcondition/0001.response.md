To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to analyze the loop and understand what it does. The loop reads an integer from the standard input, which dictates the number of times the `solve()` function will be called. However, the code snippet provided does not give any details about the `solve()` function or any variables it might modify. Therefore, we can only infer the state of variables directly involved in the loop head.

The loop head involves the variable `_` which is a throwaway variable typically used when the loop variable is not needed. The loop iterates a number of times equal to the integer read from `sys.stdin.readline()`. This integer is converted to an integer type using `int()`.

Since the body of the loop only calls `solve()` and does not modify any variables in the loop head, the state of the loop head remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop. The variable `_` is reassigned in each iteration, but it does not affect any other state outside the loop.

Thus, the output state will be the same as the initial state in terms of the variables involved in the loop head and body. No other variables are mentioned or modified, so their state remains unchanged.

Output State: **No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`.**
