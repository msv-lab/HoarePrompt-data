In the provided for loop, the only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The number of iterations of the loop is determined by the value read from `sys.stdin.readline()`, which is then converted to an integer.

To ensure that the loop can execute, the value read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be a positive integer. The state before the loop starts should reflect this requirement.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`, the value read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be a positive integer**.
