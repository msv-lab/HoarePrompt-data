### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The third condition can be rewritten using properties of the gcd. Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) translates to:
\[ a + b = dx + dy = d(x + y) \]
must be a multiple of
\[ b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = dy \cdot d = d^2 y \]
This implies:
\[ d(x + y) \equiv 0 \pmod{d^2 y} \]
which simplifies to:
\[ x + y \equiv 0 \pmod{dy} \]
or equivalently:
\[ x + y = k \cdot dy \]
for some integer \(k\). Since \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, this condition is satisfied for specific values of \(x\) and \(y\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code includes several utility functions for input/output operations and a main function `func_16` that handles multiple test cases. The function `func_15` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs for each test case. Here is the core logic of `func_15`:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

The logic in `func_15` is as follows:
1. It reads the values of `n` and `m`.
2. It initializes `ans` to 0.
3. It iterates through values of `i` starting from 1 up to `m` and as long as \(i^2 \le n + i\).
4. For each `i`, it increments `ans` by the integer division of \((n + i)\) by \(i^2\).
5. Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

This logic does not directly correspond to the gcd-based condition derived from the problem statement. The provided code seems to use a different approach, but it is not immediately clear if this approach correctly counts the valid pairs.

#### Verification Using Annotations:
The annotations provide insights into the behavior of each function, but they do not directly validate the correctness of the logic in `func_15` with respect to the problem requirements. The annotations describe the operations performed by each function, but they do not provide a clear link between the operations and the problem's conditions.

#### Conclusion:
Given that the provided code does not seem to directly implement the gcd-based logic derived from the problem statement, and there is no clear explanation or derivation of the logic used in `func_15`, we cannot confidently conclude that the program is correct. The logic in `func_15` does not directly correspond to the problem's requirements, and there is no evidence in the annotations that validates its correctness.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
