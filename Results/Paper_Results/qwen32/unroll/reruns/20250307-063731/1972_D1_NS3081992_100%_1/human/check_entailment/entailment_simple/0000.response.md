### Reasoning:

The given problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_7()` reads the integers \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case.

2. **Core Calculation**:
   - `func_16()` iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_15()` to compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

3. **Function `func_15()`**:
   - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It loops while \(i \le m\) and \(i \cdot i \le n + i\).
   - Inside the loop, it increments `ans` by \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\).
   - After the loop, it returns `ans - 1`.

4. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten using the property of gcd. Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes \(dx + dy = d(x + y)\) being a multiple of \(dy \cdot d = d^2 y\), which simplifies to \(x + y\) being a multiple of \(dy\). Given \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, this further simplifies to checking specific conditions based on divisors.
   - The loop in `func_15()` seems to be counting pairs based on the divisor properties, but the exact logic for counting valid pairs is not immediately clear from the code snippet alone. However, the implementation seems to be based on some mathematical insight into the problem.

5. **Output**:
   - The result of `func_15()` for each test case is printed.

### Conclusion:
The provided code snippet includes a loop that iterates over each test case and computes the number of valid pairs using `func_15()`. The function `func_15()` appears to be implementing a specific mathematical approach to count the pairs, although the exact derivation of the formula is not provided in the comments.

Given the problem constraints and the provided output for the example cases, the code seems to be correct. However, without a detailed mathematical proof of the formula used in `func_15()`, we can only rely on the correctness based on the provided test cases and the behavior of the code.

### Correctness:
