To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to understand the functions `func_10()` and `func_15()`. Since these functions are not defined in the provided code, I'll make some reasonable assumptions based on typical loop patterns and common function behaviors.

1. **Assumption for `func_10()`**: This function likely returns a value that determines the number of iterations for the loop. For simplicity, let's assume `func_10()` returns a constant value, say `k`, where `k` is the number of times the loop will run.

2. **Assumption for `func_15()`**: This function likely returns a value that gets printed in each iteration of the loop. For simplicity, let's assume `func_15()` returns a constant value, say `v`.

Given these assumptions, the loop will execute `k` times, and in each iteration, it will print the value `v` followed by a newline character.

Let's formalize this with the assumptions:
- `k = func_10()`
- `v = func_15()`

After `k` iterations, the output will be `v` printed `k` times, each on a new line.

Since the exact definitions of `func_10()` and `func_15()` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `k` and `v`. However, we can describe the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **The loop has executed `k` times, and the output consists of `k` lines, each containing the value `v`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.**
