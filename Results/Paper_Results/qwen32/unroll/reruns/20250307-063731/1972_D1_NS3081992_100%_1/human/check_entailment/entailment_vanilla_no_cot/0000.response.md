To determine if the given program is correct, we need to examine whether `func_16` and `func_15` correctly solve the problem described.

Let's break down the problem and the solution:

### Problem Recap:
Given two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \), we need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \( 1 \le a \le n \)
2. \( 1 \le b \le m \)
3. \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

### Analysis of the Program:

#### Function `func_15`:
This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \( n \) and \( m \). The function iterates over possible values of \( b \) and calculates the number of valid \( a \) for each \( b \).

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

- The loop iterates as long as \( i \le m \) and \( i^2 \le n + i \).
- For each \( i \), it calculates the number of valid \( a \) using the formula \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
- The final result is `ans - 1`.

#### Function `func_16`:
This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_15`.

```python
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
```

### Verification:

The key part of the solution is the logic in `func_15`. The loop condition and the formula used need to be verified against the problem statement.

The condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) can be simplified as follows:
- Let \( d = \gcd(a, b) \), then \( a = dx \) and \( b = dy \) where \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \).
- The condition becomes \( dx + dy = d(x + y) \) being a multiple of \( dy \cdot d = d^2 y \).
- This simplifies to \( x + y \) being a multiple of \( dy \), or \( x + y = k \cdot dy \) for some integer \( k \).

The provided solution seems to be based on a different logic and does not directly match the derived condition. The loop and the formula used in `func_15` do not directly correspond to the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_15` does not align with the problem's requirement.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
