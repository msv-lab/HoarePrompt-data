Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The core logic for solving this problem is encapsulated in the `func_15` function. However, there are several issues with this function:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The function `func_15` calculates the number of valid pairs using the formula `(n + i) // (i * i)`, but this formula does not correctly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The condition requires a more nuanced approach involving the greatest common divisor (gcd).

2. **Off-by-One Error**: The function subtracts 1 from the result, which might be an attempt to correct for over-counting, but it is not a general solution and does not handle all cases correctly.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition `while i <= m and i * i <= n + i` is not sufficient to cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\). The loop should consider all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), find valid \(a\) values.

Here is a more correct approach to solve the problem:

```python
import math
import sys

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        m = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This approach iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly, ensuring correctness for all test cases. The original program does not achieve this and hence is incorrect.
