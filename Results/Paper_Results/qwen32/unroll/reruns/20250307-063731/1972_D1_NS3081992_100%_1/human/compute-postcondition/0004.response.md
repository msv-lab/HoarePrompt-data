To determine the output state after the loop finishes executing, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initial State:**
  - `n` and `m` are positive integers returned by `func_7()`.
  - `i` is initialized to 1.
  - `ans` is initialized to 0.

- **Loop Condition:**
  - The loop continues as long as `i <= m` and `i * i <= n + i`.

- **Loop Body:**
  - In each iteration, `ans` is incremented by `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
  - `i` is incremented by 1.

### Iteration Breakdown:
- The loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 each time, as long as both conditions (`i <= m` and `i * i <= n + i`) are satisfied.
- For each value of `i`, the expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` is evaluated and added to `ans`.

### Output State Determination:
- The loop will run for all values of `i` that satisfy the conditions.
- After the loop terminates, the final value of `ans` will be the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all valid `i`.
- The values of `n` and `m` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The value of `i` will be the first value that does not satisfy the loop condition.

### Output State:
- `n` and `m` remain the same as they were initially.
- `i` will be the smallest integer greater than `m` or the smallest integer such that `i * i > n + i`.
- `ans` will be the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all valid `i`.

Given the above analysis, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **`n` and `m` remain unchanged; `i` is the smallest integer greater than `m` or such that `i * i > n + i`; `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to the final value of `i` minus one.**
