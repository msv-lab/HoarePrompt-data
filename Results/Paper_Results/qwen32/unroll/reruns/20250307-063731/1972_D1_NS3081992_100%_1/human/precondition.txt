The function `drank` is not correctly defined according to the problem description. The correct function should take two integers `n` and `m` as input parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases, where each test case contains two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6). The number of test cases `t` is given at the beginning and satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.
