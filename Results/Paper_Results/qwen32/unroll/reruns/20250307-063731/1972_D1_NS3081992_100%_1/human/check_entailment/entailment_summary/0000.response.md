### Reasoning:

The task is to determine the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- 1 ≤ a ≤ n
- 1 ≤ b ≤ m
- a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The provided code consists of multiple functions, but the key function for solving the problem is `func_15`. This function calculates the number of valid pairs for given n and m.

Let's analyze `func_15`:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```
- `func_7()` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
- It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
- It iterates while `i` is less than or equal to `m` and `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`.
- In each iteration, it adds the integer division `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans`.
- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

The function `func_16` handles the input/output for multiple test cases:
```python
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
```
- `func_10()` reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it calls `func_15()` and writes the result to the standard output.

### Analysis of `func_15`:
The logic in `func_15` is based on the mathematical condition given in the problem. The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be simplified to finding pairs (a, b) such that `a` and `b` satisfy the given condition. The loop in `func_15` iterates through possible values of `i` (which is related to `b` in the problem) and calculates the valid pairs.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify `func_15` with the first test case from the example:
- Input: `n = 1`, `m = 1`
- The loop condition `i <= m and i * i <= n + i` translates to `1 <= 1 and 1 * 1 <= 1 + 1`, which is true.
- Inside the loop, `ans += (1 + 1) // (1 * 1) = 2 // 1 = 2`. So, `ans` becomes 2.
- After the loop, `ans - 1` is returned, which is `2 - 1 = 1`. This matches the expected output for the first test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. `func_15` correctly calculates the number of valid pairs for given `n` and `m`, and `func_16` correctly handles multiple test cases.
