You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze the problem requirements and the provided code.

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

In the provided code, `func_16` is the main function that handles the input/output for multiple test cases. It calls `func_15` for each test case. Let's analyze `func_15` to see if it correctly implements the logic to count valid pairs.

Here's a breakdown of `func_15`:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

The logic in `func_15` is as follows:
1. It reads the values of `n` and `m`.
2. It initializes `ans` to 0.
3. It iterates through values of `i` starting from 1 up to `m` and as long as \(i^2 \le n + i\).
4. For each `i`, it increments `ans` by the integer division of \((n + i)\) by \(i^2\).
5. Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

Now, let's compare this logic with the problem requirements. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten using properties of the gcd. Specifically, if \(d = \gcd(a, b)\), then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) for some integers \(x\) and \(y\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes:
\[ a + b = dx + dy = d(x + y) \]
must be a multiple of
\[ b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = dy \cdot d = d^2 y \]
This implies:
\[ d(x + y) \equiv 0 \pmod{d^2 y} \]
which simplifies to:
\[ x + y \equiv 0 \pmod{dy} \]
or equivalently:
\[ x + y = k \cdot dy \]
for some integer \(k\). Given that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, this condition is satisfied for specific values of \(x\) and \(y\).

The provided code does not directly implement this gcd-based logic. Instead, it seems to use a different approach based on iterating through values and counting valid pairs. However, the specific logic in the code does not clearly correspond to the problem's requirements.

Given that the provided code does not seem to correctly implement the logic required by the problem, we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
