To determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze the problem requirements and the provided code.

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

In the provided code, `func_16` is the main function that handles the input/output for multiple test cases. It calls `func_15` for each test case. Let's analyze `func_15` to see if it correctly implements the logic to count valid pairs.

Here's a breakdown of `func_15`:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

The logic in `func_15` is as follows:
1. It reads the values of `n` and `m`.
2. It initializes `ans` to 0.
3. It iterates through values of `i` starting from 1 up to `m` and as long as \(i^2 \le n + i\).
4. For each `i`, it increments `ans` by the integer division of \((n + i)\) by \(i^2\).
5. Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

Now, let's compare this logic with the problem requirements. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten using properties of the gcd. Specifically, if \(d = \gcd(a, b)\), then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) for some integers \(x\) and \(y\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes:
\[ a + b = dx + dy = d(x + y) \]
must be a multiple of
\[ b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = dy \cdot d = d^2 y \]
This implies:
\[ d(x + y) \equiv 0 \pmod{d^2 y} \]
which simplifies to:
\[ x + y \equiv 0 \pmod{dy} \]
or equivalently:
\[ x + y = k \cdot dy \]
for some integer \(k\). Given that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, this condition is satisfied for specific values of \(x\) and \(y\).

The provided code does not directly implement this gcd-based logic. Instead, it seems to use a different approach based on iterating through values and counting valid pairs. However, the specific logic in the code does not clearly correspond to the problem's requirements.

Given that the provided code does not seem to correctly implement the logic required by the problem, we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
