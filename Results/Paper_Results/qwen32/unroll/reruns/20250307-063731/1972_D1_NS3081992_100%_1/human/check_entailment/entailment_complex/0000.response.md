### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly addresses the problem statement.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of several functions, but only `func_15` and `func_16` are relevant to solving the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **`func_15()`**:
   - This function is supposed to compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It reads \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7()`.
   - It initializes a counter `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates over \(i\) from 1 up to \(m\) or until \(i \cdot i > n + i\).
   - For each \(i\), it increments `ans` by \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\).
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

2. **`func_16()`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases using `func_10()`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_15()` and writes the result to standard output.

#### Evaluation:
The core logic for counting valid pairs is in `func_15()`. However, the logic does not correctly implement the problem's constraints. Specifically, the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly addressed by the current implementation.

The provided code seems to be attempting a different approach that does not match the problem's requirements. The logic in `func_15()` appears to be calculating something related to divisors or sums, but it does not ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here's a correct approach:

1. Iterate over all \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
2. For each \(a\), iterate over all \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

Given the constraints, this approach might be inefficient, but it aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. The logic in `func_15()` does not ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

**Correctness: False**
