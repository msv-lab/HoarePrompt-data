To determine the state before the for loop starts, let's analyze the given for loop statement:

```
for _ in range(func_10()):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute based on the return value of `func_10()`. To ensure the loop executes, `func_10()` must return a positive integer. The variables `n` and `m` are mentioned in the initial state but are not part of the loop head, so we cannot adjust them directly to make the loop execute. The only thing we can control is the return value of `func_10()`.

Since we cannot adjust `n` and `m` directly, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer. Let's assume `func_10()` is a function whose return value we can control or is dependent on `n` and `m` in some way. However, since the problem doesn't specify how `func_10()` is defined or related to `n` and `m`, we can only state that `func_10()` must return a positive integer for the loop to execute.

Given the constraints on `n` and `m` (both are positive integers), we can assume that `func_10()` could be defined in a way that it uses `n` and `m` to return a positive integer. But without the exact definition of `func_10()`, we can only state the necessary condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and `func_10()` must return a positive integer**.
