The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It reduces `k` by the sum of `(m - a[i])` for all elements `a[i]` in `a` that are less than `m`. The function returns 1 if the reduced `k` is non-negative; otherwise, it returns -1.
