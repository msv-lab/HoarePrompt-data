### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rephrased as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

Given \(d = \gcd(a, b)\), we have \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). Substituting these into the condition, we get:
\[ dx + dy = k \cdot dy \cdot d \]
\[ x + y = k \cdot d \cdot y \]
\[ x + y \equiv 0 \pmod{dy} \]
This implies that \(x + y\) must be a multiple of \(dy\).

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code includes multiple functions, but the main logic for solving the problem is in `func_15` and `func_16`.

- **Function `func_16`:** This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_15` for each test case and writes the result to standard output.
- **Function `func_15`:** This function reads \(n\) and \(m\), initializes `ans` to 0, and iterates through values of `i` from 1 to \(m\) as long as \(i^2 \le n + i\). For each `i`, it increments `ans` by \((n + i) // (i * i)\) and finally returns `ans - 1`.

The logic in `func_15` is not directly related to the gcd-based condition described above. Instead, it seems to be counting pairs based on a different mathematical approach, which is not immediately clear from the problem requirements.

#### Verification Against Function Summary:
The function summary for `func_16` states that it executes a loop a number of times determined by the return value of `func_10()` and writes the return value of `func_15()` to the standard output for each test case. This part is correct as per the code.

However, the function summary does not provide any insight into whether `func_15` correctly implements the logic to count the valid pairs as per the problem requirements.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not seem to correctly implement the logic required by the problem. The logic in `func_15` does not align with the gcd-based condition that needs to be satisfied for the pairs \((a, b)\).

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
