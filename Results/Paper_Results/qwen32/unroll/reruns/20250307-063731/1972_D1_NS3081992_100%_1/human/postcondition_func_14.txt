The function calculates and returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of the integer division `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` starting from 1 up to, but not including, the smallest integer greater than `m` or the smallest integer such that `i * i` exceeds `n + i`. The values of `n` and `m` are determined by the function `func_7()`.
