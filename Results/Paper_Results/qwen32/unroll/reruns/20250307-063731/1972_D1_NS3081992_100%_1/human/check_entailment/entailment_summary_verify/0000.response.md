### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the issues with `func_15` and why the original assessment is accurate:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The formula `(n + i) // (i * i)` used in `func_15` does not correctly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This formula appears to be an attempt to optimize the counting process but does not accurately reflect the problem's constraints.
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) requires a more detailed check involving the greatest common divisor, which the current formula does not provide.

2. **Off-by-One Error**:
   - Subtracting 1 from the result in `func_15` might be an attempt to correct for over-counting, but it is not a general solution. The subtraction does not handle all cases correctly and can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `while i <= m and i * i <= n + i` is not sufficient to cover all possible pairs \((a, b)\). The loop should consider all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), find valid \(a\) values.
   - The provided formula does not systematically check each pair \((a, b)\) for the required condition, leading to potential omissions or incorrect counts.

### Correct Approach:

The correct approach, as suggested in the original assessment, involves iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition directly. Here is a more correct implementation:

```python
import math
import sys

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        m = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation correctly checks each pair \((a, b)\) for the required condition, ensuring correctness for all test cases.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
