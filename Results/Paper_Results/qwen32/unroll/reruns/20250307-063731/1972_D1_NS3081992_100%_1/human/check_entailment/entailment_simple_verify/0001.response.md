To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to carefully analyze the logic in `func_15` and see if it correctly counts the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires counting pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

Using the properties of the gcd, we can derive that \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]
If \(d = \gcd(a, b)\), then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes:
\[ dx + dy = d(x + y) \equiv 0 \pmod{d^2 y} \]
\[ x + y \equiv 0 \pmod{dy} \]
\[ x + y = k \cdot dy \]
for some integer \(k\). However, this condition is complex to implement directly in a simple loop.

### Code Analysis
The provided code in `func_15` is:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

#### Breakdown of `func_15`
1. **Reading Input**: The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).
2. **Initialization**: It initializes `ans` to 0.
3. **Loop**: It iterates through values of `i` starting from 1 up to `m` and as long as \(i^2 \le n + i\).
4. **Counting**: For each `i`, it increments `ans` by the integer division of \((n + i)\) by \(i^2\).
5. **Return**: Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

The logic in the code seems to be counting some specific pairs based on the loop and the division, but it does not directly correspond to the gcd-based condition derived above.

### Validation Using Annotations
The annotations do not provide detailed validation of the logic in `func_15` against the problem requirements. However, the annotations describe the behavior of the functions and their inputs/outputs, which do not contradict the original assessment.

### Conclusion
Given that the logic in `func_15` does not clearly correspond to the problem's requirements and the original assessment suggests that the program is incorrect, we should maintain the original assessment.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
