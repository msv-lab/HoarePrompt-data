The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `trumps`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `trump_suit`, or the cards. The only change is the creation of the `trumps` list. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS"; there are 2n cards, each card is a string of length 2, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS"; all cards are distinct; `trump` is the value read from the input; `trumps` is an empty list.**
