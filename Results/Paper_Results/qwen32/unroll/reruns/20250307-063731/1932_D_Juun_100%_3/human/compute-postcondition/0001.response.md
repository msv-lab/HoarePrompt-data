Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16, `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS". There are 2n cards, each card is a string of length 2, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS". All cards are distinct. The input() function has been called, which reads a line of input but does not affect the variables `t`, `n`, `trump_suit`, or the cards.

```
trump = input()
```

After executing the code, the variable `trump` is assigned the value of the input read from the user. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `trump_suit`, and the cards) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS"; there are 2n cards, each card is a string of length 2, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS"; all cards are distinct; `trump` is the value read from the input.**
