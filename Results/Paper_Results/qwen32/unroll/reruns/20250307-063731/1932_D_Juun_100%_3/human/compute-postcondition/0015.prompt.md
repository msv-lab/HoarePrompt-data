You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16, trump_suit is a character that is one of "CDHS". There are 2n cards, each card is a string of length 2, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS". All cards are distinct.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: - `t` remains the same.
    #- `n` remains the same.
    #- `trump_suit` remains the same.
    #- `cards` remains the same.
    #- `trumps`: Contains the sorted ranks of all cards that are of the trump suit.
    #- `answers`: Contains the pairs of cards (not of the trump suit) from the same suit, sorted by rank.
    #- `suits`: Contains `None` for all suits, as any stored cards would have been paired and added to `answers`.
    #
    #Output State:
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: `t` remains the same. `n` remains the same. `trump_suit` remains the same. `cards` remains the same. `trumps`: []. `answers`: [processed pairs]. `suits`: {all suits: None}.
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: `t` remains the same; `n` remains the same; `trump_suit` remains the same; `cards` remains the same; `trumps`: []; `answers`: [processed pairs]; `suits`: {all suits: None}.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: t remains the same; n remains the same; trump_suit remains the same; cards remains the same; trumps: []; answers: [processed pairs]; suits: {all suits: None}.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases (where 1 <= t <= 100). For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 16), a character `trump_suit` which is one of "CDHS", and a list of 2n distinct cards. Each card is a string of length 2, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS". The function returns the total score for all test cases based on the given rules.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
