Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16, trump_suit is a character that is one of "CDHS". There are 2n cards, each card is a string of length 2, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS". All cards are distinct. The input() function has been called, which reads a line of input but does not affect the variables t, n, trump_suit, or the cards.**

In simpler terms: The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100. For each test case, `n` remains an integer between 1 and 16, and `trump_suit` remains one of the characters "CDHS". The 2n cards, each consisting of a rank and a suit, remain distinct. The `input()` function has been executed, which reads a line of input but does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `trump_suit`, or the cards.
