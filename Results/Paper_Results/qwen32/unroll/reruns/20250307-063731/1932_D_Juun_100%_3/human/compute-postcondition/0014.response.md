Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases (where 1 <= t <= 100). For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 16), a character `trump_suit` which is one of "CDHS", and a list of 2n distinct cards. Each card is a string of length 2, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS". The function returns the total score for all test cases based on the given rules.**
