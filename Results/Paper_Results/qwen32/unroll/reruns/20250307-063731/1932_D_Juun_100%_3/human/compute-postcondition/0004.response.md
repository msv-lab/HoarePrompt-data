Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS"; there are 2n cards, each card is a string of length 2, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS"; all cards are distinct; `trump` is the value read from the input; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is an empty list; `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`.**

In natural language: The value of `suits` is now a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`. All other variables retain their initial values.
