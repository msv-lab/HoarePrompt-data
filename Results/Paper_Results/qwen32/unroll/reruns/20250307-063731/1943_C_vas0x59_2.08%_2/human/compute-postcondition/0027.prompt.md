You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: u2vs is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex index (0 to n-1). n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and it is such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes that are directly connected to the corresponding node.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: path_ba contains the shortest path from node 0 to node b in reverse order.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: `path_ba` contains the shortest path from node 0 to node b in reverse order, and the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ops` is a list of tuples where each tuple is `(c, i)` with `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`; `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
    else :
        c2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        c1 = c2 - 1
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: `path_ba` contains the shortest path from node 0 to node b in reverse order; `ops` contains pairs of indices `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each odd `i` from 1 to `n/2 - 1`; the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`.
    #State: `path_ba` contains the shortest path from node 0 to node b in reverse order. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list of tuples where each tuple is `(c, i)` with `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`; `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains pairs of indices `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each odd `i` from `1` to `n/2 - 1`; `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: len(ops) (where len(ops) is (len(path_ba) // 2) + 1 if len(path_ba) is odd, or len(path_ba) if len(path_ba) is even)
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: c+1 i (where c is an element from path_ba and i is an index based on the length of path_ba)
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `u2vs`, which is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex index (0 to n-1). It also accepts an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, with the constraint that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3. The function returns `None`.

Return Postconditions: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
