To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ops))` statement, let's break down the problem based on the given initial state:

1. **Understanding `path_ba`**:
   - `path_ba` is the shortest path from node 0 to node b in reverse order.
   - The length of `path_ba` can be either odd or even.

2. **Determining `ops` based on the length of `path_ba`**:
   - **If the length of `path_ba` is odd**:
     - `ci` (center index) is calculated as `len(path_ba) // 2`.
     - `ops` is a list of tuples where each tuple is `(c, i)` with `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`.
     - `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`, which is `path_ba[ci]`.
     - The number of elements in `ops` is `ci + 1` because `i` ranges from `0` to `ci`.

   - **If the length of `path_ba` is even**:
     - `c1` (first center index) is calculated as `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`.
     - `c2` (second center index) is calculated as `len(path_ba) // 2`.
     - `ops` contains pairs of indices `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each odd `i` from `1` to `n/2 - 1`.
     - The number of elements in `ops` is `(len(path_ba) // 2 - 1) * 2 + 2` because there are pairs for each odd `i` from `1` to `n/2 - 1` plus the two center elements.

3. **Calculating the Length of `ops`**:
   - **Odd Length**:
     - `len(ops) = ci + 1 = (len(path_ba) // 2) + 1`
   - **Even Length**:
     - `len(ops) = (len(path_ba) // 2 - 1) * 2 + 2 = len(path_ba)`

Given that `len(path_ba)` is the length of the list `path_ba`, we can summarize the length of `ops` as follows:
- If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `len(ops) = (len(path_ba) // 2) + 1`.
- If `len(path_ba)` is even, `len(ops) = len(path_ba)`.

However, without the exact length of `path_ba`, we can only describe the length of `ops` in terms of `len(path_ba)`.

Thus, the final output will be:
Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is (len(path_ba) // 2) + 1 if len(path_ba) is odd, or len(path_ba) if len(path_ba) is even)**
