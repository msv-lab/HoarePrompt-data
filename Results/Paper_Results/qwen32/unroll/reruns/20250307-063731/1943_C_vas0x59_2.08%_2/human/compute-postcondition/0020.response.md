To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variables `i`, the range's start (1), the range's stop (`len(path_ba) - c1`), and the range's step (2).

### Analysis:
1. **Range Start (1):** The loop starts at `i = 1`. This value is already specified in the loop head and does not need adjustment.
2. **Range Stop (`len(path_ba) - c1`):** The loop stops before reaching `len(path_ba) - c1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the range stop must be greater than the range start (1). Therefore, `len(path_ba) - c1` must be greater than 1.
3. **Range Step (2):** The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration. This value is already specified in the loop head and does not need adjustment.
4. **Variable `c1`:** `c1` is calculated as `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`. Since `path_ba` has an even length, `c1` will be an integer. For the loop to execute, `len(path_ba) - c1` must be greater than 1.

### Calculation:
- Given `len(path_ba)` is even, let `len(path_ba) = 2k` for some integer `k`.
- `c1 = len(path_ba) // 2 - 1 = k - 1`.
- The loop stop condition is `len(path_ba) - c1 = 2k - (k - 1) = k + 1`.
- For the loop to execute, `k + 1 > 1` which simplifies to `k > 0`. Since `k` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, `k > 0` implies `len(path_ba) > 2`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes at least once, `len(path_ba)` must be greater than 2. Given that `path_ba` has an even length, the smallest possible length for `path_ba` that satisfies this condition is 4. Therefore, `len(path_ba)` must be at least 4.

### Final State:
State: **`path_ba` contains the shortest path from node 0 to node b in reverse order with a length of at least 4; `ops` is an empty list; `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`; `i` is 1**
