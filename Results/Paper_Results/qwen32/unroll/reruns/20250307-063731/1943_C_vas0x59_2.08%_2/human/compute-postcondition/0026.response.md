Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `u2vs`, which is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex index (0 to n-1). It also accepts an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, with the constraint that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3. The function returns `None`.**
