The value of `c1` is assigned the value of `c2 - 1`. Since `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, `c1` becomes `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`. The values of `path_ba`, `ops`, and the length of `path_ba` remain unchanged. The precondition that the length of `path_ba` is even is still valid.

Output State: **`path_ba` contains the shortest path from node 0 to node b in reverse order; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`.**
