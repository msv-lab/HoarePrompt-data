The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that the value of `n` will change based on the input provided. The initial state mentioned that `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree and has a specific value or range (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3). After the execution of the code, `n` will take the value of the integer input, and the precondition that `u2vs` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex index (0 to n-1) remains valid.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex index (0 to n-1); `n` is the integer input value.**
