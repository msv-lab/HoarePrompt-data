To determine the output state, let's break down what the loop does:

The loop runs `n - 1` times, and in each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `u` and `v`. These integers are decremented by 1 (to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indexing), and then `v` is appended to the list at index `u` in `u2vs`, and `u` is appended to the list at index `v` in `u2vs`.

This essentially builds an adjacency list representation of an undirected graph with `n` nodes and `n - 1` edges. Each node will have a list of its neighboring nodes.

Given that the initial state is `u2vs` being a list of `n` empty lists, after `n - 1` iterations, `u2vs` will contain the adjacency lists for each node after all edges have been added.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes that are directly connected to the corresponding node.**
