Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes that are directly connected to the corresponding node; `d` is the list of distances returned by `bfs(a)` from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph; `a` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`; `previous` is the list of previous nodes returned by `bfs(a)`; `b` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
