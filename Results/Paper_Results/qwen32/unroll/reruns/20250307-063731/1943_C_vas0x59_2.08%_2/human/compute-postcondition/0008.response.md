The code snippet creates a new list `path_ba` and initializes it with the value of `b`. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes that are directly connected to the corresponding node; `d` is the list of distances returned by `bfs(a)` from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph; `a` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`; `previous` is the list of previous nodes returned by `bfs(a)`; `b` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`.**
