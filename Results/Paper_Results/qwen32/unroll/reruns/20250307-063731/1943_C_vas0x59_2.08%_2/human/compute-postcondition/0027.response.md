Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads input to construct an adjacency list representation of a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges. It then determines the longest path in the tree and generates a specific sequence of operations based on the length of this path. If the path length is odd, it creates a list of operations centered around the middle element of the path. If the path length is even, it creates pairs of operations from the middle two elements of the path. The function prints the number of operations and the operations themselves, each operation being a pair of indices. The function returns `None`.**
