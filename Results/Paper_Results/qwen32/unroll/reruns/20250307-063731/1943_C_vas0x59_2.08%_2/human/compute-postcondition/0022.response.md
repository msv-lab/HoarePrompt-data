Postcondition: **`path_ba` contains the shortest path from node 0 to node b in reverse order. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list of tuples where each tuple is `(c, i)` with `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`; `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains pairs of indices `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each odd `i` from `1` to `n/2 - 1`; `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`.**
