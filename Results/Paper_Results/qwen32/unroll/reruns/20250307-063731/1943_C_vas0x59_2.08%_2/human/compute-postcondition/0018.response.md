The value of `c2` is assigned the result of `len(path_ba) // 2`. Since the length of `path_ba` is even, `c2` will be an integer representing half the length of `path_ba`. The other variables (`path_ba` and `ops`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path_ba` contains the shortest path from node 0 to node b in reverse order; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.**
