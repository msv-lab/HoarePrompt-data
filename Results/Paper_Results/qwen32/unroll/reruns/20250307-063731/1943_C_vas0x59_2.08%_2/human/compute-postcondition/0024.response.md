Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `path_ba` contains the shortest path from node 0 to node `b` in reverse order.
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
  - `ops` is a list of tuples where each tuple is `(c, i)` with `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`.
  - `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.
  - `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even:
  - `ops` contains pairs of indices `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each odd `i` from `1` to `n/2 - 1`.
  - `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.
  - `c1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
```

### Explanation:
1. **Determine the Structure of `ops`**:
   - If `path_ba` has an odd length, `ops` will contain tuples `(c, i)` where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` ranges from `0` to `ci` (half the length of `path_ba`).
   - If `path_ba` has an even length, `ops` will contain pairs of tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each odd `i` from `1` to `n/2 - 1`, where `c1` and `c2` are the middle two elements of `path_ba`.

2. **Transformation by `map`**:
   - The `map` function applies a lambda function to each element in `ops`.
   - The lambda function `lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'` takes each tuple `x` in `ops` and formats it as a string where the first element of the tuple is incremented by 1 and then concatenated with the second element of the tuple.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print` function prints each formatted string from the `map` function, separated by newlines (`sep='\n'`).

### Example Cases:
- **Odd Length `path_ba`**:
  - Suppose `path_ba = [3, 2, 1, 0]` (odd length, middle element is `2`).
  - `ops` would be `[(2, 0), (2, 1)]`.
  - After applying the lambda function, `ops` becomes `['3 0', '3 1']`.
  - Output: **3 0\n3 1**

- **Even Length `path_ba`**:
  - Suppose `path_ba = [3, 2, 1, 0, -1]` (even length, middle elements are `2` and `1`).
  - `ops` would be `[(2, 1), (1, 1)]`.
  - After applying the lambda function, `ops` becomes `['3 1', '2 1']`.
  - Output: **3 1\n2 1**

### General Output:
Based on the above explanation, the output will be a series of lines, each containing a formatted string of the form `c+1 i` where `c` is an element from `path_ba` and `i` is an index.

Output: **c1+1 i\nc2+1 i\n... (where c1 and c2 are elements from path_ba and i is an index based on the length of path_ba)**

Since the exact `path_ba` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values, but we can describe the format of the output based on the given structure.

Output: **c+1 i (where c is an element from path_ba and i is an index based on the length of path_ba)**
