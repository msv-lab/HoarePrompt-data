To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the loop and its impact on the variables involved.

The loop is:
```python
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)
```

### Explanation:
- `path_ba` is initialized with a single element, `b`, which is the value returned by `func_1(d)`. This `b` is the destination node for which we are trying to find the path from the source node `0`.
- `previous` is a list where `previous[i]` gives the previous node in the shortest path from the source node `0` to node `i`.
- The loop continues to execute until `previous[path_ba[-1]]` is `-1`. This `-1` indicates that there is no previous node, meaning we have reached the source node `0`.

### Iteration Process:
1. **First Iteration:**
   - `n = previous[path_ba[-1]]` â†’ `n = previous[b]`
   - If `n` is not `-1`, append `n` to `path_ba`. `path_ba` now contains `[b, n]`.
2. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - The loop continues to find the previous node of the last node in `path_ba` and appends it to `path_ba` until it reaches the source node `0` (i.e., when `previous[path_ba[-1]]` is `-1`).

### Final State:
- The loop terminates when `path_ba[-1]` is the source node `0`, and `previous[0]` is `-1`.
- At this point, `path_ba` contains the path from the destination node `b` back to the source node `0`, in reverse order.

### Output State:
- `path_ba` will contain the nodes from `b` to `0` in reverse order, representing the shortest path from `0` to `b`.

Given the above explanation, the output state is:
Output State: **path_ba contains the shortest path from node 0 to node b in reverse order.**
