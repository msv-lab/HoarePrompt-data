You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly constructs a k-level permutation as per the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to create a permutation of length `n` such that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. The provided code attempts to achieve this by filling the permutation array in a specific pattern.

### Code Analysis
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function reads the input values `n` and `k`, initializes a permutation array, and fills it in a pattern where each index `i` is filled with a value that is incremented by 1 each time it fills an index that is a multiple of `k` plus `i`.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1()`
Let's break down the steps in `func_1()`:
- It initializes an array `permutation` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
- It uses a loop to fill the permutation array. For each `i` from 0 to `k-1`, it fills the indices that are multiples of `k` plus `i` with increasing values starting from 1.
- The variable `curr_v` keeps track of the current value to be placed in the permutation array.

### Example Walkthrough
Let's consider an example with `n=10` and `k=4`:
- Initialize `permutation` as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- For `i=0`, fill indices `0, 4, 8` with `1, 2, 3` respectively.
- For `i=1`, fill indices `1, 5, 9` with `4, 5, 6` respectively.
- For `i=2`, fill indices `2, 6` with `7, 8` respectively.
- For `i=3`, fill index `3, 7` with `9, 10` respectively.
- The resulting permutation is `[1, 4, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 10, 3, 6]`.

### Checking the k-level Condition
Let's check if the resulting permutation satisfies the k-level condition:
- Calculate the sums of all continuous segments of length `k`:
  - `1 + 4 + 7 + 9 = 21`
  - `4 + 7 + 9 + 2 = 22`
  - `7 + 9 + 2 + 5 = 23`
  - `9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 24`
  - `2 + 5 + 8 + 10 = 25`
  - `5 + 8 + 10 + 3 = 26`
  - `8 + 10 + 3 + 6 = 27`
- The maximum sum is 27, and the minimum sum is 21, which means the difference is 6, not 1.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly construct a k-level permutation because the sums of the continuous segments of length `k` do not differ by no more than 1. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
