Precondition: **This function does not have any parameters in its signature. It reads input from the standard input, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers, n and k, where 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even. The variable t represents the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4).**
