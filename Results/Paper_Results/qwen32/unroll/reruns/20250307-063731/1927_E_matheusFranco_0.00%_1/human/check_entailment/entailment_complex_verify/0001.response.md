### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided code does not correctly construct a k-level permutation. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate a permutation of length `n` such that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - `func_1()`: Initializes a permutation array and fills it by placing increasing values at indices that are multiples of `k` plus `i` for `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
   - `func_2()`: Handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

3. **Detailed Analysis of `func_1()`**:
   - The code fills the permutation array in a specific pattern, but this pattern does not guarantee that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` will differ by no more than 1.

4. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - For `n=10` and `k=4`, the permutation generated is `[1, 4, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 10, 3, 6]`.
   - The sums of all continuous segments of length `k` are calculated as follows:
     - `1 + 4 + 7 + 9 = 21`
     - `4 + 7 + 9 + 2 = 22`
     - `7 + 9 + 2 + 5 = 23`
     - `9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 24`
     - `2 + 5 + 8 + 10 = 25`
     - `5 + 8 + 10 + 3 = 26`
     - `8 + 10 + 3 + 6 = 27`
   - The maximum sum is 27, and the minimum sum is 21, resulting in a difference of 6, which is not within the required condition of differing by no more than 1.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The sums of the continuous segments of length `k` do not satisfy the k-level condition, as the difference between the maximum and minimum sums is greater than 1.
   - Therefore, the provided code does not correctly construct a k-level permutation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
