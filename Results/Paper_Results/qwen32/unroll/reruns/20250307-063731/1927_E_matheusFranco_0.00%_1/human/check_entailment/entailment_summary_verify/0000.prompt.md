You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        t -= 1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `k`. It processes each test case by calling `func_1()` and outputs the result for each case. After processing all test cases, it terminates.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to construct a `k`-level permutation of length `n`.
- A `k`-level permutation is defined such that among all the sums of continuous segments of length `k`, any two sums differ by no more than 1.
- The sum array `s` of length `n-k+1` should satisfy `max(s) - min(s) <= 1`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: Constructs a permutation for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: Handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()`.

Let's break down `func_1()`:
- It initializes a permutation array of length `n` with zeros.
- It uses a loop to fill the permutation array in a specific pattern.
- For each `i` in the range `[0, k)`, it places values starting from `1` at positions that are multiples of `k` plus `i`.

Here is an example of how the permutation is constructed for `n=10` and `k=4`:
- `i=0`: Places `1, 5, 9`
- `i=1`: Places `2, 6, 10`
- `i=2`: Places `3, 7`
- `i=3`: Places `4, 8`

The resulting permutation is: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.

### Checking the `k`-level Condition:
For `n=10` and `k=4`, the sums of all continuous segments of length `4` are:
- `1+2+3+4 = 10`
- `2+3+4+5 = 14`
- `3+4+5+6 = 18`
- `4+5+6+7 = 22`
- `5+6+7+8 = 26`
- `6+7+8+9 = 30`
- `7+8+9+10 = 34`

The maximum sum is `34` and the minimum sum is `10`, which violates the `k`-level condition (`max(s) - min(s) > 1`).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not generate a `k`-level permutation for all cases. It simply fills the permutation array in a sequential manner without ensuring the `k`-level condition.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not guarantee that the permutation will satisfy the `k`-level condition for all values of `n` and `k`. The example provided (`n=10`, `k=4`) demonstrates that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` do not meet the required condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
