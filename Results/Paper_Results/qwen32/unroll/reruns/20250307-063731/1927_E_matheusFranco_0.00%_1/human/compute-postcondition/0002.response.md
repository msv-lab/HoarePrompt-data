Output State: **t is 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. In each iteration, `func_1()` is called, and then `t` is decremented by 1. This process repeats until `t` becomes 0, at which point the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will be 0.
