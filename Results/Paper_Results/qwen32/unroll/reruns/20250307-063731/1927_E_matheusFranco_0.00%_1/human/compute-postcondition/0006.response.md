Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to understand how the output state is determined.

The given loop iterates `k` times. In each iteration `i`, it fills the `permutation` list with values starting from `curr_v` at positions that are multiples of `k` plus `i`. The variable `curr_v` is incremented after each assignment to the `permutation` list.

Here's the breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `n` and `k` are integers with `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even.
   - `permutation` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.
   - `idx` is 0.
   - `idx_v` is 1.
   - `curr_v` is 1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop runs `k` times with `i` taking values from 0 to `k-1`.
   - For each `i`, the inner while loop starts at `multiples_of_k_plus_i = i` and increments by `k` each time, assigning `curr_v` to the corresponding position in `permutation`.
   - After each assignment, `curr_v` is incremented.

Let's illustrate with an example where `n = 10` and `k = 4`:
- **Iteration 1 (i = 0)**:
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at 0 and increments by 4: 0, 4, 8.
  - `permutation` becomes: [1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
  - `curr_v` is now 4.
- **Iteration 2 (i = 1)**:
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at 1 and increments by 4: 1, 5, 9.
  - `permutation` becomes: [1, 4, 0, 0, 2, 5, 0, 0, 3, 6]
  - `curr_v` is now 7.
- **Iteration 3 (i = 2)**:
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at 2 and increments by 4: 2, 6.
  - `permutation` becomes: [1, 4, 7, 0, 2, 5, 8, 0, 3, 6]
  - `curr_v` is now 9.
- **Iteration 4 (i = 3)**:
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at 3 and increments by 4: 3, 7.
  - `permutation` becomes: [1, 4, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 10, 3, 6]
  - `curr_v` is now 11.

In general, the `permutation` list will contain values from 1 to the total number of elements filled, which is `n` divided by `k` rounded up for each `i` position, and `curr_v` will be the next value to be assigned after the loop completes.

Given the constraints and the loop behavior, the final state of the variables will be:
- `permutation` will be filled with values from 1 to the total number of elements filled.
- `curr_v` will be the next value to be assigned after the loop completes.
- `idx`, `idx_v` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop.

Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **permutation is a list of length `n` filled with values from 1 to the total number of elements filled according to the loop's behavior, `curr_v` is the next value to be assigned after the loop completes, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1.**
