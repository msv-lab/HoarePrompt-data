### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations provided to determine if the program correctly constructs a k-level permutation as described in the problem statement.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to construct a permutation of length `n`.
- The permutation should be k-level, meaning that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` should differ by no more than 1.

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: Constructs a permutation for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: Handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()`.

Here is the detailed breakdown of `func_1()`:

- **Initialization**: 
  - A permutation array of length `n` is initialized with zeros.
  - `curr_v` is initialized to 1, which will be used to fill the permutation array with distinct values.
  
- **Filling the Permutation**:
  - The outer loop runs `k` times (from 0 to `k-1`).
  - For each `i` in this range, the inner while loop fills the permutation array with values starting from `curr_v` at positions that are multiples of `k` plus `i`.
  - This means for each `i`, values are placed at indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` until the end of the array.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Let's consider an example with `n=10` and `k=4`:
- For `i=0`, values `1, 5, 9` are placed at indices `0, 4, 8`.
- For `i=1`, values `2, 6, 10` are placed at indices `1, 5, 9`.
- For `i=2`, values `3, 7` are placed at indices `2, 6`.
- For `i=3`, values `4, 8` are placed at indices `3, 7`.

The resulting permutation is: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.

#### Checking the k-level Condition:
For `n=10` and `k=4`, the sums of all continuous segments of length `4` are:
- `1+2+3+4 = 10`
- `2+3+4+5 = 14`
- `3+4+5+6 = 18`
- `4+5+6+7 = 22`
- `5+6+7+8 = 26`
- `6+7+8+9 = 30`
- `7+8+9+10 = 34`

The maximum sum is `34` and the minimum sum is `10`. This clearly violates the k-level condition (`max(s) - min(s) > 1`).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not generate a k-level permutation for all cases. It simply fills the permutation array in a sequential manner without ensuring the k-level condition. This is consistent with the original assessment.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect as it does not guarantee that the permutation will satisfy the k-level condition for all values of `n` and `k`.
