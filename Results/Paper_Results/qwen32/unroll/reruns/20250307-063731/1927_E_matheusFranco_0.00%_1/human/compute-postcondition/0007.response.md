The code snippet takes the list `permutation` and joins its elements into a single string with spaces in between. This results in a new variable `result` being created and assigned this string value. The other variables `curr_v`, `idx`, and `idx_v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`permutation` is a list of length `n` filled with values from 1 to the total number of elements filled according to the loop's behavior; `curr_v` is the next value to be assigned after the loop completes; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `permutation`.**
