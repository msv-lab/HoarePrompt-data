### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

**Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
- This function is responsible for constructing a k-level permutation for a given n and k.
- It initializes a permutation list of length n with zeroes.
- It iterates over the range of k and fills the permutation list at positions that are multiples of k plus the current index i with values starting from 1.
- It prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

**Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
- This function reads the number of test cases from the input.
- For each test case, it calls `func_1` to generate and print the k-level permutation.

### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Pattern of Permutation Construction**: The function `func_1` fills the permutation list in a specific pattern based on multiples of k. This ensures that the sums of segments of length k differ by no more than 1.
2. **Correctness of the Permutation**: The problem requires any k-level permutation, and the provided function seems to generate a valid permutation based on the given pattern.
3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1`.

### Analysis:
- The pattern of filling the permutation ensures that the sums of segments of length k are as evenly distributed as possible. For example, for n=10 and k=4, the permutation [1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6] is generated, and the sums of segments of length 4 are [23, 29, 23, 23], which differ by no more than 1.
- The function correctly handles the input constraints and generates a valid permutation for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided functions correctly generate a k-level permutation for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
