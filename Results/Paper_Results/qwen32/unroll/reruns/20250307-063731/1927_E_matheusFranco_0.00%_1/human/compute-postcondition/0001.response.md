To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` so that the condition `t > 0` is satisfied. Given the precondition that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, we know that `t` should already be within a valid range that satisfies `t > 0`. However, to explicitly ensure that the loop can execute at least once, we should confirm that `t` is indeed greater than 0.

Since the precondition guarantees that `t` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, we don't need to change the value of `t` itself, but we should state that `t` must be within the valid range to ensure the loop executes.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and it is assigned the value from the standard input, with the precondition that `1 <= t <= 10^4`**
