### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and see if it meets the problem requirements for constructing a k-level permutation.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Permutation**: The array must be a permutation of length `n`, which means it should contain all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once.
2. **k-level Permutation**: The permutation is k-level if the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any `k`-length contiguous subarray is at most 1.

#### Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - This function is responsible for constructing a permutation for a single test case.
  - It initializes a list `permutation` of size `n` with zeros.
  - It then fills this list based on a pattern where each index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` (which starts at `i` and increments by `k` each time) is assigned the next value in the sequence starting from 1.
  - Finally, it prints the constructed permutation.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - This function handles multiple test cases.
  - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.

#### Evaluation:
1. **Permutation Check**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not guarantee that all integers from 1 to `n` will be included in the permutation. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the function will fill indices 0, 4, 8 with 1, 2, 3 respectively, and then fill indices 1, 5, 9 with 4, 5, 6 respectively, and so on. However, it will not necessarily fill all indices from 0 to 9 with distinct values from 1 to 10.
   - Hence, the constructed permutation may not include all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once, violating the permutation requirement.

2. **k-level Permutation Check**:
   - The problem requires that the sums of all `k`-length contiguous subarrays differ by at most 1. The current implementation does not ensure this property.
   - The pattern used in `func_1` does not guarantee that the sums of `k`-length subarrays will have a difference of at most 1.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not construct a valid permutation for the given problem. It fails to ensure that the permutation contains all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once and does not guarantee that the permutation is k-level.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
