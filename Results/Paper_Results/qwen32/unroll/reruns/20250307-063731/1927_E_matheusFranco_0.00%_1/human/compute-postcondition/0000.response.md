Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and it is assigned the value from the standard input. The precondition that `1 <= t <= 10^4` is still valid.**

In natural language: The variable `t` is now an integer that holds the number of test cases, read from the standard input. The constraints on `t` (that it must be between 1 and 10,000 inclusive) remain unchanged.
