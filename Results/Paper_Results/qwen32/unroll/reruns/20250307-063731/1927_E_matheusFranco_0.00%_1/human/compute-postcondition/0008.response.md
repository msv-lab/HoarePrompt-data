Let's break down the given information and deduce the output step by step.

- `permutation` is a list of length `n` filled with values from 1 to `n`.
- `curr_v` is the next value to be assigned after the loop completes. However, `curr_v` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `idx` is initialized to 0.
- `idx_v` is initialized to 1.
- `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `permutation`.

Given the initial state, `permutation` is a list containing numbers from 1 to `n`. The `result` variable is constructed by joining these numbers with spaces.

For example, if `n` is 5, `permutation` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and `result` would be `"1 2 3 4 5"`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can't determine the exact numerical values in the list. However, we can describe the format of the output based on the given information.

Output: **result (where result is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of the `permutation` list, which contains numbers from 1 to n)**
