Functionality: **The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `k`, with the constraints 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even. The function processes each test case and returns the result for each case.**
