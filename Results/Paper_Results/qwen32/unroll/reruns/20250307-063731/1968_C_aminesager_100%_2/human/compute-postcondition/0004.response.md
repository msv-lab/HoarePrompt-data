Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the array, followed by `n-1` integers representing the elements of the array `x`. The function returns the missing element in the array `x` for each test case, assuming the array should contain all integers from 1 to `n`.**
