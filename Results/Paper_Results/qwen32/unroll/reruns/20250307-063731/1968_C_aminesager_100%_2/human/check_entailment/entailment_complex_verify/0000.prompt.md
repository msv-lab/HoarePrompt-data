You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in the array a. The second line contains n-1 integers x_2, x_3, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) representing the elements of the array x. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

        print(result)
        
    #State: t is 0, n is the number of elements in the last test case, T is the list of integers from the last test case, a is the cumulative sum list starting from 1000 for the last test case, and result is the string representation of the list a for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a list of `n` integers starting from 1000, where each subsequent integer is the sum of the previous integer and the corresponding element from the input list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the array `a` that satisfies the conditions specified in the problem description. Let's analyze the logic:

The program initializes `a` with `[1000]` and then for each subsequent element, it adds the corresponding `x_i` to the previous element of `a`. This approach does not guarantee that the generated array `a` will satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.

Let's consider a simple counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Input:
```
1
3
1 1
```

Expected Output:
The output should be an array `a` such that:
- `a[1]` can be any number (since `a_1` is not constrained by any `x_i`).
- `a[2] % a[1] = 1`
- `a[3] % a[2] = 1`

A valid output could be `2 3 4` or `3 4 5` or any other valid array that satisfies the conditions.

However, the program will output:
```
1000 1001 1002
```

But `1001 % 1000 = 1` and `1002 % 1001 = 1`, which is correct for this specific input, but let's consider another input:

Input:
```
1
3
2 1
```

Expected Output:
The output should be an array `a` such that:
- `a[1]` can be any number (since `a_1` is not constrained by any `x_i`).
- `a[2] % a[1] = 2`
- `a[3] % a[2] = 1`

A valid output could be `3 5 6` or `4 6 7`.

However, the program will output:
```
1000 1002 1003
```

But `1002 % 1000 = 2` is correct, but `1003 % 1002 = 1` is correct in this specific case, but this is not a general solution. For example:

Input:
```
1
3
1 2
```

Expected Output:
The output should be an array `a` such that:
- `a[1]` can be any number (since `a_1` is not constrained by any `x_i`).
- `a[2] % a[1] = 1`
- `a[3] % a[2] = 2`

A valid output could be `3 4 6` or `4 5 7`.

However, the program will output:
```
1000 1001 1003
```

Here, `1001 % 1000 = 1` is correct, but `1003 % 1001 = 2` is correct in this specific case, but the logic is not general.

Thus, the program does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs, and therefore, it is incorrect.
