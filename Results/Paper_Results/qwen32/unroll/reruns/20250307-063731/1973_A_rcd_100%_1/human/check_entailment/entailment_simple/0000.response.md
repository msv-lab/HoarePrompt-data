### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players in chess games, adhering to the constraints provided. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic used in the program:

1. **Input Parsing and Constraints Checking:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` of the three players, ensuring `0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30`.

2. **Sum of Scores Must Be Even:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is because each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2 to the winner, or 1 to each player in case of a draw). Therefore, the total score across all games must be even.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` indicating the scores are inconsistent.

3. **Handling Cases Where `p3 >= p1 + p2`:**
   - If the score of the highest-scoring player `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the scores of the other two players `p1 + p2`, it implies that `p3` could have won all games against the other two players. In this case, the maximum number of draws possible is `p1 + p2` because `p1` and `p2` could have played among themselves any number of times resulting in draws.
   
4. **Handling Other Cases:**
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws. It initializes two pointers `x` and `y` to `0` and `p3` respectively. The idea is to try to balance the points between `p1` and `p2` by considering different distributions of wins and draws.
   - The loop iterates while `y >= x`. For each iteration, it checks if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. If true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` as the maximum number of draws possible and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid distribution, it prints `p3` as the maximum number of draws.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where no games were played (`p1 == p2 == p3 == 0`) by printing `0` as the number of draws.
   - It also correctly handles cases where the scores are inconsistent by printing `-1`.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws given the constraints and examples provided. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the scores are consistent with a valid set of games.

**Correctness: True**
