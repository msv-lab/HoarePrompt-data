Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle all scenarios to determine the maximum number of draws. Specifically, the logic in the `else` block is flawed and does not always provide the correct result. Let's analyze why:

1. **Sum of Scores Check:** The program correctly checks if the sum of scores `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0`. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because points can only be awarded in even increments (2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw).

2. **Case When `p3 >= p1 + p2`:** The program correctly identifies that if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`. This is because the remaining points after accounting for draws must be won by `p3` against the other two players.

3. **Else Case:** The logic in the `else` block is incorrect. The program attempts to find the maximum number of draws by iterating through possible values of `x` and `y` but does not correctly account for all scenarios. The conditions and the way `x` and `y` are updated do not guarantee finding the correct maximum number of draws.

Let's consider a corrected approach:

- **Calculate Total Games Played:** Since each game contributes either 2 points (if one player wins) or 2 points (if it's a draw), the total number of games is `(p1 + p2 + p3) / 2`.
- **Calculate Draws:** The maximum number of draws can be calculated by considering that the difference between the scores of the players must be accounted for by wins. The remaining points can be attributed to draws.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        total_games = total_points // 2
        # The maximum draws is when the differences are minimized by wins
        # We need to check if the differences can be covered by wins
        if p3 - p2 > total_games - (p3 - p2):
            print(-1)
        elif p2 - p1 > total_games - (p3 - p2):
            print(-1)
        else:
            # The maximum draws is the total games minus the necessary wins
            necessary_wins = (p3 - p2) + (p2 - p1)
            max_draws = total_games - necessary_wins
            print(max_draws)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the differences in scores are covered by wins and calculates the maximum number of draws correctly.
