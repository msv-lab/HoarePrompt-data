You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. Each of the following t lines contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.

    t = int(input())

        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0

            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: a series of printed values for each of the `t` iterations, based on the conditions described above.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. For each test case, it prints a value based on specific conditions: if the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a value that is the maximum possible sum of two numbers from the set `{p_1, p_2, p_3}` under certain constraints.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when the scores do not correspond to a valid set of games and results. Let's analyze the code and identify a problematic case.

### Issues in the Code

1. **Handling of Draws and Wins**:
   - The code attempts to determine the maximum number of draws by adjusting `x` and `y` in a while loop. However, the logic for updating `x` and `y` is not entirely correct.
   - The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is used to determine the number of draws, but this logic does not account for all possible valid configurations of games and scores.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the scores cannot be achieved through a valid set of games. For example, the case `1 1 10` should return `-1` because it's impossible to achieve such scores with the given rules.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior

Consider the test case `1 1 10`:

- The total points are `12`, which is an even number, so the initial check `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` does not trigger.
- The code then enters the while loop with `x = 0` and `y = 10`.
- The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is checked, but since `1 - 0` is not less than or equal to `1 - 10`, the loop continues.
- The loop eventually exits without finding a valid configuration, and the code prints `p3`, which is `10`. This is incorrect because it's impossible to achieve the scores `1 1 10` with the given rules.

### Conclusion

The program fails to correctly determine the maximum number of draws for all possible valid sets of scores and also incorrectly handles cases where the scores cannot be achieved. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To fix the program, a more robust approach to determine the maximum number of draws and validate the scores would be necessary.
