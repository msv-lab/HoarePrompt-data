The code snippet reads an integer `t` from the input. This integer represents the number of test cases that follow. The value of `t` is updated to this input value. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and this condition still holds after the input is read. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` for each test case are not affected by this code snippet and remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. Each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30.**
