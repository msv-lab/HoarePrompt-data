Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. For each test case, it prints a value based on specific conditions: if the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a value that is the maximum possible sum of two numbers from the set `{p_1, p_2, p_3}` under certain constraints.**
