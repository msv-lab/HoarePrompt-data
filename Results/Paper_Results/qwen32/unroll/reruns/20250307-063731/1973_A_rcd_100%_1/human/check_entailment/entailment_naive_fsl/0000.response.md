Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when the scores do not correspond to a valid set of games and results. Let's analyze the code and identify a problematic case.

### Issues in the Code

1. **Handling of Draws and Wins**:
   - The code attempts to determine the maximum number of draws by adjusting `x` and `y` in a while loop. However, the logic for updating `x` and `y` is not entirely correct.
   - The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is used to determine the number of draws, but this logic does not account for all possible valid configurations of games and scores.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the scores cannot be achieved through a valid set of games. For example, the case `1 1 10` should return `-1` because it's impossible to achieve such scores with the given rules.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior

Consider the test case `1 1 10`:

- The total points are `12`, which is an even number, so the initial check `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` does not trigger.
- The code then enters the while loop with `x = 0` and `y = 10`.
- The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is checked, but since `1 - 0` is not less than or equal to `1 - 10`, the loop continues.
- The loop eventually exits without finding a valid configuration, and the code prints `p3`, which is `10`. This is incorrect because it's impossible to achieve the scores `1 1 10` with the given rules.

### Conclusion

The program fails to correctly determine the maximum number of draws for all possible valid sets of scores and also incorrectly handles cases where the scores cannot be achieved. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To fix the program, a more robust approach to determine the maximum number of draws and validate the scores would be necessary.
