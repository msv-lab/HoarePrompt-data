### Reasoning:

1. **Sum Check**: The program first checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If the sum is odd, it is impossible to achieve these scores because each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2 to the winner, 1 each in a draw, or 0 to the loser), so the total points must be even. If the sum is odd, the program correctly outputs `-1`.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program outputs `p1 + p2`. This is based on the reasoning that if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, then all games involving the player with `p3` could have been draws with the other players, and the remaining points can be distributed without any conflicts. The maximum number of draws in this case is `p1 + p2` because the player with `p3` could have drawn with both other players `p1` and `p2` a total of `p1 + p2` times.
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws. The loop iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` where `x` is the number of games the player with `p1` lost to the player with `p3` and `y` is the number of games the player with `p2` lost to the player with `p3`. The loop ensures that the remaining points for `p1` and `p2` after accounting for these losses can be distributed without conflicts. Specifically, `p1 - x` (remaining points for `p1`) should be less than or equal to `p2 - y` (remaining points for `p2`), ensuring that the points are consistent with the games played. If such a combination is found, the program outputs `p1 - x + p3`, which is the total number of draws plus the points scored by the player with `p3`. If no such combination is found, the program outputs `p3`, which is the maximum number of draws if no games were played between `p1` and `p2`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as no games played (`p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`), cases where the scores are not possible (`p1 + p2 + p3` is odd), and cases where the highest score is significantly larger than the sum of the other two scores.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or to identify if the given scores are inconsistent. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
