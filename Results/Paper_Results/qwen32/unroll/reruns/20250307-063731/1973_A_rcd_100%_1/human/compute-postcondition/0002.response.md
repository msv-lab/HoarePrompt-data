To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop for each set of inputs `(p1, p2, p3)`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Input Parsing**: For each iteration, the loop reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
2. **Sum Check**: It checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` and moves to the next iteration.
3. **Dominance Check**: If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`.
4. **Finding Maximum Sum**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the loop uses a while loop to find the maximum possible sum of two numbers from the set `{p1, p2, p3}` such that the difference between `p1` and the first number is less than or equal to the difference between `p2` and the second number. If such a pair is found, it prints their sum plus `p3`. If no such pair is found, it prints `p3`.

Since the loop processes each set of inputs independently and the state of `t` (the number of iterations) does not change during the loop, the output state will be a series of printed values corresponding to each set of inputs.

Given the initial state, the output state will be a series of printed values for each of the `t` iterations, based on the conditions described above.

Output State: **a series of printed values for each of the `t` iterations, based on the conditions described above.**
