You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to see if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Total Points Check**: The total points (p1 + p2 + p3) must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win/loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw).
2. **Upper Bound for Draws**: If p3 (the highest score) is greater than or equal to p1 + p2, the maximum number of draws would be p1 + p2. This is because the highest score could be achieved by the player with p3 winning all games against the player with p1, and all other games ending in draws.
3. **Iterative Calculation**: If p3 < p1 + p2, we need to find the maximum number of draws. This involves finding non-negative integers x and y such that:
   - x is the number of games the player with p1 lost.
   - y is the number of games the player with p3 won.
   - The player with p1 must have played x games and lost all of them, so p1 - x should be non-negative.
   - The player with p2 must have played y games and won all of them, so p2 - y should be non-negative.
   - The player with p3 must have won y games and drawn the rest, so p3 should be equal to y plus the number of draws.
   - We iterate over possible values of x and y to find a valid combination that satisfies these conditions.

### Program Analysis

The program follows the outlined logic:

1. **Total Points Check**:
   ```python
   if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
       print(-1)
       continue
   ```
   This correctly checks if the total points are even.

2. **Upper Bound for Draws**:
   ```python
   if p3 >= p1 + p2:
       print(p1 + p2)
   ```
   This correctly handles the case where the highest score can be achieved by winning all games against the lowest scoring player and drawing the rest.

3. **Iterative Calculation**:
   ```python
   x = 0
   y = p3
   while y >= x:
       if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
           print(p1 - x + p3)
           break
       else:
           x += 1
           y -= 1
   else:
       print(p3)
   ```
   This part of the code iterates over possible values of x and y to find a valid combination of wins and draws. However, there is a logical error here.

   - The condition `if p1 - x <= p2 - y` is not sufficient to ensure that the scores are consistent. We need to ensure that the remaining points for p2 and p3 can be distributed among the remaining games.
   - The loop does not correctly account for the possibility that the remaining points for p2 and p3 might not be achievable with the given x and y values.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly the iterative calculation part. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
