Let's analyze the program step by step to see if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Total Points Check**: The total points (p1 + p2 + p3) must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win/loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw).
2. **Upper Bound for Draws**: If p3 (the highest score) is greater than or equal to p1 + p2, the maximum number of draws would be p1 + p2. This is because the highest score could be achieved by the player with p3 winning all games against the player with p1, and all other games ending in draws.
3. **Iterative Calculation**: If p3 < p1 + p2, we need to find the maximum number of draws. This involves finding non-negative integers x and y such that:
   - x is the number of games the player with p1 lost.
   - y is the number of games the player with p3 won.
   - The player with p1 must have played x games and lost all of them, so p1 - x should be non-negative.
   - The player with p2 must have played y games and won all of them, so p2 - y should be non-negative.
   - The player with p3 must have won y games and drawn the rest, so p3 should be equal to y plus the number of draws.
   - We iterate over possible values of x and y to find a valid combination that satisfies these conditions.

### Program Analysis

The program follows the outlined logic:

1. **Total Points Check**:
   ```python
   if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
       print(-1)
       continue
   ```
   This correctly checks if the total points are even.

2. **Upper Bound for Draws**:
   ```python
   if p3 >= p1 + p2:
       print(p1 + p2)
   ```
   This correctly handles the case where the highest score can be achieved by winning all games against the lowest scoring player and drawing the rest.

3. **Iterative Calculation**:
   ```python
   x = 0
   y = p3
   while y >= x:
       if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
           print(p1 - x + p3)
           break
       else:
           x += 1
           y -= 1
   else:
       print(p3)
   ```
   This part of the code iterates over possible values of x and y to find a valid combination of wins and draws. However, there is a logical error here.

   - The condition `if p1 - x <= p2 - y` is not sufficient to ensure that the scores are consistent. We need to ensure that the remaining points for p2 and p3 can be distributed among the remaining games.
   - The loop does not correctly account for the possibility that the remaining points for p2 and p3 might not be achievable with the given x and y values.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly the iterative calculation part. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
