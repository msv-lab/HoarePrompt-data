### Reasoning:

The provided program and the function `func_1` seem to correctly simulate the Kraken's attack pattern and accurately count the number of ships sunk for the given problem description. Let's systematically verify this using the function summary and the problem description:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the deque `nums` to allow efficient removal from both ends, which aligns with the Kraken's attack pattern of targeting the first and last ships alternately.

2. **Attacks Loop**: The loop continues while there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and there are at least two ships (`len(nums) >= 2`). The first and last ships are attacked, and their durability is reduced by the minimum of their current durability. If a ship's durability drops to zero, it is considered sunk and not added back to the deque. The number of attacks is reduced by twice the minimum durability (since both ships are attacked). This matches the problem description.

3. **Single Ship Handling**: If there is one ship left and enough attacks remain to sink it (`k >= nums[0]`), it is sunk. This handles the case where the Kraken has enough attacks left to sink the last remaining ship.

4. **Return**: The function returns the count of sunk ships. The logic for counting sunk ships appears to be accurate based on the problem description.

### Edge Cases Considered:

1. **Single Ship (`n = 1`)**:
   - If there is only one ship, the Kraken will attack it `k` times. If `k` is greater than or equal to the ship's durability, the ship will sink. The program correctly handles this case by checking if `len(nums) == 1` and if `k >= nums[0]`.

2. **All Ships Have Same Durability**:
   - If all ships have the same durability, the Kraken will sink ships in pairs until it runs out of attacks or ships. The program correctly reduces the durability of the first and last ships by the minimum value and handles the remaining attacks accordingly.

3. **No Attacks (`k = 0`)**:
   - If there are no attacks, no ships will be sunk. The program correctly returns `0` in this case since the loop does not execute.

4. **All Ships Sunk Before `k` Attacks**:
   - If the sum of the durability of all ships is less than or equal to `k`, all ships will be sunk. The program correctly handles this case by reducing the durability of ships until they are all sunk.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program and considering various edge cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. There do not seem to be any cases where the program would fail to produce the correct output.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly simulates the Kraken's attack pattern and accurately counts the number of ships sunk for all potential cases, including edge cases with a single ship, all ships having the same durability, no attacks, and all ships sunk before `k` attacks.
