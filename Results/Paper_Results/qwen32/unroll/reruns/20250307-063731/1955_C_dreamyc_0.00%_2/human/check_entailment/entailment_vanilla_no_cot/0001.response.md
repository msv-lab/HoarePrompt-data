Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
   - It also reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Main Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the number of ships that sink.
   - It converts the list of ship durabilities into a `deque` for efficient popping from both ends.
   - It initializes a counter `ans` to 0 to keep track of the number of ships that have sunk.

3. **Attack Simulation:**
   - The program enters a loop that continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and there are at least two ships (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - Inside the loop, it pops the first and last ships from the `deque` and stores their durabilities in `a` and `b`.
   - It calculates the minimum durability `x` between `a` and `b`.
   - If there are enough attacks left to completely sink both ships (`k >= 2 * x`), it reduces the durability of both ships by `x` and decrements `k` by `2 * x`.
   - If not, it breaks out of the loop.
   - It checks if the first ship (`a`) is still above 0 durability. If so, it appends it back to the `deque`. Otherwise, it increments the `ans` counter.
   - It performs the same check and operation for the last ship (`b`).

4. **Handling the Last Ship:**
   - After exiting the loop, the program checks if there is one ship left (`len(nums) == 1`) and if there are enough attacks left to sink it (`k >= nums[0]`).
   - If so, it increments the `ans` counter.

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns the count of sunk ships `ans`.
   - The main loop prints the result for each test case.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 4`, `k = 5`, `nums = [1, 2, 4, 3]`
   - After 5 attacks, the program correctly identifies that 2 ships have sunk.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 4`, `k = 6`, `nums = [1, 2, 4, 3]`
   - After 6 attacks, the program correctly identifies that 3 ships have sunk.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `k = 20`, `nums = [2, 7, 1, 8, 2]`
   - After 20 attacks, the program correctly identifies that 5 ships have sunk.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `nums = [3, 2]`
   - After 2 attacks, the program correctly identifies that 0 ships have sunk.

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - `n = 2`, `k = 15`, `nums = [1, 5]`
   - After 15 attacks, the program correctly identifies that 2 ships have sunk.

6. **Sixth Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `k = 2`, `nums = [2, 7, 1, 8, 2]`
   - After 2 attacks, the program correctly identifies that 2 ships have sunk.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and calculates the number of ships that sink in each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
