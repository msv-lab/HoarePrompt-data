You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    return ans
    #The program returns the value of 'ans'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of elements in the list `nums`), `k` (an integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` integers). It processes the list by repeatedly removing the smallest and largest elements, reducing both by the minimum of the two, and decrementing `k` by twice that minimum value. The function returns the count of elements that are reduced to zero plus one if there is a single remaining element in the list that can be fully reduced by the remaining `k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a sequence of ship durabilities, and the Kraken alternately attacks the first and last ships in the sequence. Each attack reduces the durability of the attacked ship by one. When a ship's durability reaches zero, it sinks and is removed from the sequence. The process continues until either all ships have sunk or the Kraken has made `k` attacks.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses a `deque` to efficiently handle the removal of elements from both ends of the list. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships), `k` (number of attacks), and the list of ship durabilities.

2. **Simulation of Attacks**:
   - The list of ship durabilities is converted to a `deque` to allow efficient popping from both ends.
   - The program enters a loop that continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and there are at least two ships in the `deque`.
   - In each iteration, the program:
     - Pops the first and last ships from the `deque` (let's call them `a` and `b`).
     - Computes the minimum durability between `a` and `b` (let's call it `x`).
     - If the remaining number of attacks `k` is at least `2 * x`, it means both ships can be attacked `x` times without sinking. The program then:
       - Decreases the durability of both ships by `x`.
       - Decreases the number of remaining attacks `k` by `2 * x`.
     - If `k < 2 * x`, the loop breaks as the Kraken can't attack both ships `x` times.
     - If the durability of a ship is greater than zero after the attack, it is appended back to the `deque`. If it is zero or less, the ship is considered sunk, and the count of sunk ships (`ans`) is incremented.

3. **Handling the Last Ship**:
   - After the loop, if there is exactly one ship left in the `deque` and the remaining number of attacks `k` is at least the durability of that ship, the ship sinks, and the count of sunk ships (`ans`) is incremented by one.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the number of ships sunk.

### Correctness:
The program correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of ships that sink. It efficiently handles the sequence of attacks using a `deque` and correctly updates the count of sunk ships based on the durability of the ships and the number of attacks.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
