#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15. nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break

    #State: 
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns ans + 1
    #State: `k` is a truthy value, `nums` is a list of integers, and either the length of `nums` is not equal to 1 or `k` is less than `nums[0]`. Alternatively, `k` is a falsy value, `nums` is a list of integers, and the length of `nums` and the value of `k` relative to `nums[0]` can be any values.
    return ans
    #The program returns the value of 'ans'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of elements in the list `nums`), `k` (an integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` integers). It processes the list by repeatedly removing the smallest and largest elements, reducing both by the minimum of the two, and decrementing `k` by twice that minimum value. The function returns the count of elements that are reduced to zero plus one if there is a single remaining element in the list that can be fully reduced by the remaining `k`.
