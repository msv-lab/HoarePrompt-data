### Reasoning:
The given annotated program implements the logic correctly for determining the number of ships sunk by the Kraken after `k` attacks. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships), `k` (number of attacks), and the list `nums` representing the durability of each ship.

2. **Main Logic in `func_1` Function:**
   - The list `nums` is converted to a `deque` for efficient popping from both ends.
   - The variable `ans` keeps track of the number of ships that have sunk.
   - The `while` loop continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and there are at least two ships (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - Inside the loop:
     - The first and last ships are attacked (`a = nums.popleft()` and `b = nums.pop()`).
     - The minimum durability of the two ships (`x = min(a, b)`) is determined.
     - If the number of remaining attacks `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, both ships' durability is reduced by `x` and `k` is reduced by `2 * x`.
     - If either ship's durability is greater than zero after the attack, it is appended back to the respective end of the deque. Otherwise, the ship is considered sunk, and `ans` is incremented.
   - After exiting the loop, if there is one ship left (`len(nums) == 1`) and enough attacks remain (`k >= nums[0]`), that ship is also sunk, and `ans` is incremented by one.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all ships are sunk before all attacks are completed.
   - It also handles the case where there is only one ship left and the remaining attacks are sufficient to sink it.

4. **Complexity:**
   - The program efficiently handles large inputs due to the use of `deque` for popping from both ends and the fact that it only processes each ship a limited number of times.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles the provided examples correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
