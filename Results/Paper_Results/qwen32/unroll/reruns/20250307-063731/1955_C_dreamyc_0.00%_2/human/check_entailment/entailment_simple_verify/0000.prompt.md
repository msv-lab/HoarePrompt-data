You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description for all potential cases.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`. It then reads the durability of each ship into a deque `nums`.

The function `func_1` handles the logic for determining how many ships are sunk after `k` attacks. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The durability values are stored in a deque `nums` for efficient popping from both ends.
2. **Attacks Loop**: The loop continues while there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and there are at least two ships (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - The first and last ships are attacked, and their durability is reduced by the minimum of their current durability.
   - If the durability of a ship drops to zero, it is considered sunk and not added back to the deque.
   - The number of attacks is reduced by twice the minimum durability (since both ships are attacked).
3. **Single Ship Handling**: If there is one ship left and enough attacks remain to sink it (`k >= nums[0]`), it is sunk.
4. **Return**: The function returns the count of sunk ships.

### Correctness Evaluation

The program seems to correctly simulate the Kraken's attack pattern and count the number of ships sunk. The use of a deque allows for efficient removal of ships from both ends. The logic for handling attacks and counting sunk ships appears to be accurate based on the problem description.

### Edge Cases

Let's consider some edge cases:

1. **Single Ship (`n = 1`)**:
   - If there is only one ship, the Kraken will attack it `k` times. If `k` is greater than or equal to the ship's durability, the ship will sink.
   - The program correctly handles this case by checking if `len(nums) == 1` and if `k >= nums[0]`.

2. **All Ships Have Same Durability**:
   - If all ships have the same durability, the Kraken will sink ships in pairs until it runs out of attacks or ships.
   - The program correctly reduces the durability of the first and last ships by the minimum value and handles the remaining attacks accordingly.

3. **No Attacks (`k = 0`)**:
   - If there are no attacks, no ships will be sunk.
   - The program correctly returns `0` in this case since the loop does not execute.

4. **All Ships Sunk Before `k` Attacks**:
   - If the sum of the durability of all ships is less than or equal to `k`, all ships will be sunk.
   - The program correctly handles this case by reducing the durability of ships until they are all sunk.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and considering various edge cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. There do not seem to be any cases where the program would fail to produce the correct output.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly simulates the Kraken's attack pattern and accurately counts the number of ships sunk for all potential cases, including edge cases with a single ship, all ships having the same durability, no attacks, and all ships sunk before `k` attacks.
