Postcondition: **`k` is a truthy value, `nums` is a list of integers, and either the length of `nums` is not equal to 1 or `k` is less than `nums[0]`. Alternatively, `k` is a falsy value, `nums` is a list of integers, and the length of `nums` and the value of `k` relative to `nums[0]` can be any values.**
