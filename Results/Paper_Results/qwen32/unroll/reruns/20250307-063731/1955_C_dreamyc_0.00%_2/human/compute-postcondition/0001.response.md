Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15. `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `ans` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `ans` has been initialized to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
