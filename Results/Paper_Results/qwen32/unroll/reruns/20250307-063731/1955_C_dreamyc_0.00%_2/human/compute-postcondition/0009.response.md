Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of elements in the list `nums`), `k` (an integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` integers). It processes the list by repeatedly removing the smallest and largest elements, reducing both by the minimum of the two, and decrementing `k` by twice that minimum value. The function returns the count of elements that are reduced to zero plus one if there is a single remaining element in the list that can be fully reduced by the remaining `k`.**
