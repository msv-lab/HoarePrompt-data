Reasoning:

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The main function `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the result. The function `func_1` is responsible for determining whether it is possible to kill all monsters within the constraints before any of them reach the character at position 0.

Let's analyze the logic of `func_1`:

1. **Sorting by Distance**: The function starts by sorting the indices of the monsters based on their absolute distance from the origin. This is a crucial step because the strategy is to handle the monsters that are closest to the character first to prevent them from reaching the origin.

2. **Simulating the Game**: The function then simulates the game in rounds. In each round, it tries to eliminate as many monsters as possible by firing bullets. The number of bullets fired in each round is limited by `k`.

3. **Checking Distance Condition**: Before attempting to eliminate any monsters in a round, the function checks if any monster is already at a distance of `distance` from the origin. If so, it immediately returns `False` because the character would be killed.

4. **Eliminating Monsters**: The function then attempts to eliminate monsters by firing bullets. It fires up to `k` bullets, targeting the monsters in the order determined by the sorted indices. Each bullet reduces the health of a targeted monster by 1. If a monster's health reaches 0, it is considered eliminated and is no longer considered in subsequent rounds.

5. **Incrementing Distance**: After processing all possible eliminations in a round, the function increments the `distance` variable to simulate the movement of the remaining monsters closer to the origin.

6. **Completion Check**: The function continues this process until all monsters are eliminated (i.e., `pos` reaches the length of `sorted_indices`).

The logic in `func_1` aligns with the problem description and the provided example cases. It correctly handles the constraints and ensures that the character is not killed by any monster before all monsters are eliminated.

The function `func_2` correctly reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the appropriate result ('YES' or 'NO').

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
