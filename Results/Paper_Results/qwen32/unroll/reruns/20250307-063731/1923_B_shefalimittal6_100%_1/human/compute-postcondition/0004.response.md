Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers representing the health of monsters, a list of integers representing their positions, and an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired in one second. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to kill all monsters within the given constraints and prints 'YES' if possible, otherwise 'NO'.**
