You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle the logic for determining whether the character can survive and kill all the monsters. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the movement of the monsters after each second and the condition under which the character loses (i.e., a monster reaches position 0).

Let's analyze the main issues in the provided code:

1. **Monster Movement Handling**: The program increments the `distance` variable each iteration of the while loop, but it does not correctly simulate the movement of the monsters. The `distance` variable should represent the number of seconds that have passed, and the positions of the monsters should be updated accordingly after each second. The current code does not update the positions of the monsters within the loop.

2. **Condition for Losing**: The program checks if `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance` to determine if a monster has reached the character. However, this check is incorrect because it does not account for the updated positions of the monsters after each second. The positions of the monsters should be updated by adding or subtracting 1 each second, depending on their initial positions.

3. **Logic for Firing Bullets**: The logic for firing bullets is correct in terms of decrementing the health of the monsters and checking if they are dead. However, it should be integrated with the correct handling of monster movement.

Here's a corrected version of the program to illustrate the necessary changes:

```python
def func_1(a, x, k):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))
    time = 0
    while sorted_indices:
        # Check if any monster has reached the character
        if abs(x[sorted_indices[0]]) <= time:
            return False
        
        rest = k
        i = 0
        while rest > 0 and i < len(sorted_indices):
            delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[i]])
            rest -= delta
            a[sorted_indices[i]] -= delta
            if a[sorted_indices[i]] == 0:
                sorted_indices.pop(i)
            else:
                i += 1
        
        time += 1
        # Update the positions of the remaining monsters
        for i in range(len(sorted_indices)):
            x[sorted_indices[i]] += 1 if x[sorted_indices[i]] < 0 else -1
    
    return True

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
```

In this corrected version:
- The `time` variable is used to keep track of the number of seconds that have passed.
- The positions of the monsters are updated after each second.
- The condition for checking if a monster has reached the character is updated to correctly reflect the new positions of the monsters.

Given these issues, the original program does not correctly simulate the game mechanics and is therefore incorrect.
