Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `a`, a list of integers representing the health of n monsters; `x`, a list of integers representing the positions of n monsters such that -n <= x[0] < x[1] < ... < x[n-1] <= n and x[i] != 0 for all i; and `k`, an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired in one second. The function returns the minimum number of seconds required to kill all the monsters.**
