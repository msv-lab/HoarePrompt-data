### Reasoning:

Letâ€™s analyze the problem and how the given code attempts to solve it.

The problem involves determining whether all monsters can be killed before any of them reach the player at position 0. The player can fire up to `k` bullets per second, each targeting one monster and reducing its health by 1. After firing, any monster with health 0 or less dies, and all remaining monsters move one step closer to the player.

#### Key Points:
1. **Targeting Strategy**: The strategy implemented in `func_1` is to target monsters in the order of their distance from the player. This ensures that we deal with the closest monsters first, which are the most immediate threat.
2. **Distance Check**: The function checks if any monster is at distance 0 (reached the player) before it can be killed. If so, it returns `False`.
3. **Bullet Allocation**: The function allocates bullets to monsters based on their remaining health and the maximum number of bullets available (`k`). It ensures that the bullets are used efficiently to kill as many monsters as possible in each second.
4. **Looping Through Monsters**: The function iterates through the sorted list of monsters by their distance from the player, reducing their health and moving to the next monster once it is killed.
5. **Completion Check**: The function continues this process until all monsters are killed or a monster reaches the player.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Sorting by Distance**: The function sorts the indices of monsters based on their absolute distance from the player. This ensures that the closest monsters are handled first.
- **Distance Increment**: The function increments the distance after processing all monsters at the current distance.
- **Bullet Allocation**: The function efficiently allocates bullets to monsters, reducing their health and checking if they die.
- **Termination**: The function terminates when all monsters are killed or a monster reaches the player.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Input Handling**: The function reads the input for multiple test cases.
- **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, it calls `func_1` to determine if all monsters can be killed.
- **Output**: It prints 'YES' if all monsters can be killed, otherwise 'NO'.

#### Correctness:
The implementation in `func_1` correctly handles the problem constraints and logic:
- It ensures that the closest monsters are targeted first.
- It efficiently allocates bullets to reduce the health of monsters.
- It checks if any monster reaches the player before being killed.
- It handles the input and output correctly as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It efficiently handles the constraints and provides the correct output for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
