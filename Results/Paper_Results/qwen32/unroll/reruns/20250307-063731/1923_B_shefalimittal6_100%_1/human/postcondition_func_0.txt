The function `func_1` determines whether it is possible to eliminate all monsters by firing bullets such that no two monsters are at the same distance from the origin at the same time, given their initial health and positions, and the maximum number of bullets that can be fired in one second. It returns `True` if all monsters can be eliminated under these conditions, otherwise it returns `False`.
