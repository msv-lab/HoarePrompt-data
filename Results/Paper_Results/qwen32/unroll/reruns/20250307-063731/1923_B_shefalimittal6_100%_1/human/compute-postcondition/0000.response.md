Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the health of n monsters, `x` is a list of integers representing the positions of n monsters such that -n <= x[0] < x[1] < ... < x[n-1] <= n and x[i] != 0 for all i, and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired in one second; `t` is an input integer.**

In natural language: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an input integer. The lists `a` and `x`, and the integer `k` remain unchanged.
