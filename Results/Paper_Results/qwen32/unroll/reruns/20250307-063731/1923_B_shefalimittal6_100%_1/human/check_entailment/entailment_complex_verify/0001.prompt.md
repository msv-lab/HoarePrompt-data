You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to determine whether we can kill all monsters before any of them reach the character at position 0. Each second, we can fire up to `k` bullets, each reducing a monster's health by 1. After firing, any monster with health 0 or less dies. Then, all remaining monsters move one step closer to the character.

### Code Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:

1. **func_1(a, x, k)**:
   - This function takes the health of the monsters (`a`), their positions (`x`), and the number of bullets we can fire per second (`k`).
   - It sorts the indices of the monsters based on their absolute positions (how close they are to the character).
   - It then iterates through these sorted indices, checking if any monster reaches the character (position 0) at any point.
   - For each distance step, it fires bullets at the monsters in order of their proximity, reducing their health until either all the bullets are used or all monsters at that distance are dead.
   - If a monster reaches the character, it returns `False`. If all monsters are killed before reaching the character, it returns `True`.

2. **func_2()**:
   - This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the result.

### Key Points to Verify

1. **Sorting by Proximity**: The function sorts the monsters by their absolute distance from the character. This ensures that we target the closest monsters first, which is a reasonable strategy to prevent any monster from reaching the character.

2. **Bullet Firing Logic**: The function uses a while loop to fire bullets at the monsters, reducing their health until either all bullets are used or all monsters at the current distance are dead. This logic is correct for the problem requirements.

3. **Checking Distance**: The function checks if any monster reaches the character at any point by comparing the current distance with the absolute position of the monster. If a monster reaches the character, it returns `False`.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The `func_2` function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input and calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion

The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It sorts the monsters by their proximity, fires bullets at them in an optimal manner, and checks if any monster reaches the character. The code handles multiple test cases as well.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **True**
