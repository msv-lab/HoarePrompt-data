To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to consider the condition `t > 0`. The variables `start` and `end` are not part of the loop condition and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t > 0`.
2. **Determine the requirement**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. **Adjust the state**: Since `t` is the only variable in the loop condition, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state where `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, and `t` is an input integer, we need to adjust `t` to be greater than 0.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` must be greater than 0**.
