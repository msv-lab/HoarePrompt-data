Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s`. It then prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions related to the count of '1's in the string `s`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.**
