`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`. The value of `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer.**
