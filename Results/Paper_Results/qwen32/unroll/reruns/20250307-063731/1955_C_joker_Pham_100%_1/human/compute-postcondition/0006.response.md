Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`), `k` (an integer), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It processes these inputs to determine a value `sunks`, which it returns. Despite the annotations suggesting otherwise, the function does not always return 3; instead, it returns the number of operations performed under specific conditions related to the values of `k` and the elements in `a`.**
