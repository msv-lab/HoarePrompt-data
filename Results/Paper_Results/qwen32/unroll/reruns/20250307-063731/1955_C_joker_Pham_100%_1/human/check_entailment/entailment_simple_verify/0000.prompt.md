You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the Kraken attacks the ships as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for reducing the durability and counting the sunk ships is flawed.

Let's consider a test case to demonstrate the issue:

### Test Case:
```
1
3 5
1 2 1
```

### Expected Output:
```
3
```

### Explanation of Expected Output:
1. Kraken attacks the first ship (durability 1), it sinks. Remaining ships: `[2, 1]`.
2. Kraken attacks the last ship (durability 1), it sinks. Remaining ships: `[2]`.
3. Kraken attacks the first ship (durability 2), reduces to 1. Remaining ships: `[1]`.
4. Kraken attacks the last ship (durability 1), it sinks. Remaining ships: `[]`.
5. Kraken attacks the first ship (no ships left), no effect.

Total ships sunk: 3.

### Actual Output of the Program:
The program will not correctly handle this case because it does not properly account for the reduction in durability and the sinking of ships in the alternating first-last pattern.

### Specific Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Durability Reduction:**
   - The code does not correctly reduce the durability of the ships in the alternating first-last pattern.
   - The code does not properly handle the case when the durability of the first or last ship is reduced to zero and should be removed from the list of ships to be attacked.

2. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The code uses a while loop to alternate between the first and last ship, but it does not correctly decrement the durability and check for sinking in each iteration.
   - The code does not handle the scenario where the Kraken attacks the same ship multiple times until it sinks.

### Correct Approach:
- Use a two-pointer approach to keep track of the first and last ship.
- In each iteration, reduce the durability of the first ship by 1 if `k > 0`.
- If the first ship's durability drops to 0, increment the count of sunk ships and move the first pointer to the next ship.
- Similarly, reduce the durability of the last ship by 1 if `k > 0`.
- If the last ship's durability drops to 0, increment the count of sunk ships and move the last pointer to the previous ship.
- Continue this process until `k` attacks are completed or all ships have sunk.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
