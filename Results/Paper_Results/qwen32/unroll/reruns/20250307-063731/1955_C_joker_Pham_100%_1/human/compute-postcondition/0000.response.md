The code snippet initializes two variables `l` and `r` to 0 and `n - 1`, respectively. The value of `n` is given in the initial state, and it remains unchanged. The other variables `t`, `k`, and `a` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`.**
