To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition `l <= r`. The variables `l` and `r` are the only ones involved in the loop condition.

Given:
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.

The condition `l <= r` will be true if `0 <= n - 1`. This inequality holds true as long as `n` is at least 1. Since the problem states that `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, the condition `0 <= n - 1` is always satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `l` and `r` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `sunks` is 0**
