The code snippet creates a `Counter` object from the list `arr`. This `Counter` object, named `nums`, will count the frequency of each integer in the list `arr`. The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and the length of `arr` is `n`.

After executing the code, `nums` will be a dictionary-like object where the keys are the unique integers from `arr`, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and the length of `arr` is `n`; `nums` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.**
