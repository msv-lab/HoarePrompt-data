Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the optimal game score based on the rules described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob or correctly calculate the MEX of the final array `c`.

Here are some key points of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Game Simulation**: The game involves both players making strategic choices to maximize or minimize the MEX of the final array `c`. The provided program does not simulate these turns. Alice and Bob should be alternating their choices, but the program just processes the array in a single pass.

2. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. The program attempts to find the MEX by checking consecutive integers starting from 0, but it does not correctly simulate the game dynamics that influence the final composition of `c`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: Alice and Bob's strategies are not considered. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she should try to avoid filling in the smallest possible numbers. Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the MEX, so he should try to fill in the smallest possible numbers. The current implementation does not reflect these strategic decisions.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the game turns and keep track of the numbers added to `c` in an optimal manner. It should also efficiently calculate the MEX of the final array `c` after all elements have been processed.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
import collections as c

def mex(arr):
    vis = set(arr)
    i = 0
    while i in vis:
        i += 1
    return i

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    
    # Simulate the game
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
            while nums.get(start, 0) == 0:
                start += 1
            nums[start] -= 1
            vis.add(start)
        else:  # Bob's turn
            while nums.get(start, 0) == 0:
                start += 1
            nums[start] -= 1
    
    # Calculate the MEX of the final array c
    print(mex(vis))
```

This corrected version simulates the game turns and calculates the MEX of the final array `c` after all elements have been processed.
