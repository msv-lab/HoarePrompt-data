To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the given initial state and how the variable `start` is defined.

### Initial State Analysis:
- The loop is designed to find the last consecutive integer starting from 0 in the list `arr`.
- `start` is the last integer in this sequence of consecutive integers.

### Determining the Value of `start`:
- The loop presumably iterates through `arr` and checks for consecutive integers starting from 0.
- `start` is the highest integer found in this sequence.

### Given Code:
```python
print(start)
```

### Explanation:
- `start` is the last consecutive integer found in the list `arr` starting from 0.
- Since the exact list `arr` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `start`.
- However, we know that `start` will be the highest consecutive integer starting from 0 that is found in `arr`.

### Output:
Output: **start (where start is the last consecutive integer found in the list `arr` starting from 0)**
