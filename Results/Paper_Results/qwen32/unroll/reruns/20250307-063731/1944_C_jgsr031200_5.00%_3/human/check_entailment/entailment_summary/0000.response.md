### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to find the MEX of the array `c` after a game between Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the score (MEX), while Bob wants to minimize it. Both players play optimally.

The provided program seems to be attempting to determine the MEX of the array `arr` directly, which is essentially the same as finding the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `arr`. This is because the game mechanics (Alice appending elements to `c` and Bob removing elements from `a`) do not affect the MEX calculation if both play optimally. The optimal strategy for Alice is to always pick the smallest available number that can extend the sequence, and Bob's strategy to minimize the MEX does not change the fact that the MEX is determined by the presence of numbers from 0 upwards.

The program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in `arr`. It then iterates through the numbers starting from 0, decrementing the count of each number in the `Counter` and checking if the next number is also present. If a number is missing, it prints and returns that number as the MEX.

### Execution Summary Analysis:

- The program correctly initializes a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each number in the input array.
- It iterates over the numbers starting from 0, checking if each number is present in the `Counter`.
- If a number is present, it decrements its count in the `Counter`.
- If the next number is not present, it prints and returns the current number as the MEX.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `arr` based on the problem's requirements, assuming both players play optimally. The execution summary aligns with the intended behavior of the program.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
