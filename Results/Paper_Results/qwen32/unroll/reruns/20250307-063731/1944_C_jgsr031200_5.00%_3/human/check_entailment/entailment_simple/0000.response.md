### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c`.
- Alice aims to maximize the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

#### Key Points:
- Alice and Bob play optimally.
- The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in `c` after all elements from `a` have been processed.
- The strategy revolves around the fact that Alice and Bob will eventually remove all elements from `a`, and the final MEX of `c` will be determined by the sequence of elements added to `c`.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr`.
- The function `func_1` is called with `arr` as an argument.
- Inside `func_1`, a `Counter` is used to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
- The program then iterates from `start = 0` upwards, decrementing the count of `start` and `start + 1` in the counter if they exist.
- The loop continues until an integer `start` is found that does not have a count in the counter.
- The program prints `start + 1` if `start + 1` exists in the counter, otherwise it prints `start`.

#### Correctness:
- The core idea of the function is to find the smallest integer that is not present in the array `arr` after all elements have been considered.
- The use of `Counter` to keep track of element counts and the loop to find the smallest missing integer is correct.
- The function correctly identifies the MEX by checking consecutive integers starting from 0 and decrementing their counts.
- The final print statement correctly outputs the smallest integer that is not present in the array, which is the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after all elements from `a` have been processed optimally by Alice and Bob.

#### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
