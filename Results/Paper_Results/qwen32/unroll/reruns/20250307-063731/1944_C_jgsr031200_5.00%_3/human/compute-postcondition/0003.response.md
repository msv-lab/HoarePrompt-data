To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `nums.get(start, 0)`. This condition checks if the count of the integer `start` in the `Counter` object `nums` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and the length of `arr` is `n`.
- `nums` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- `start` is 0.
- `vis` is an empty set.

For the `while` loop to execute, `nums.get(start, 0)` must be greater than 0. Since `start` is 0, this means `nums.get(0, 0)` must be greater than 0, implying that the integer 0 must appear at least once in the list `arr`.

To ensure this, we need to adjust the state so that the integer 0 is present in `arr`. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n`, and `arr` contains at least one 0; `nums` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr` with `nums[0] > 0`; `start` is 0; `vis` is an empty set.**

This ensures that `nums.get(start, 0)` evaluates to a value greater than 0, allowing the `while` loop to execute.
