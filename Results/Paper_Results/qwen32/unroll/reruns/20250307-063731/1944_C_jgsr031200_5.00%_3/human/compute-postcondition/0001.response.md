Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and the length of `arr` is `n`; `nums` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`; `start` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet only initializes the variable `start` to 0. The other variables `arr` and `nums` remain unchanged.
