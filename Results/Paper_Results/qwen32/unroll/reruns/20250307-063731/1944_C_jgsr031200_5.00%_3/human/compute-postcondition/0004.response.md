To determine the output state, let's analyze the given loop and initial conditions step by step.

### Initial Conditions:
- `arr`: A list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and the length of `arr` is `n`.
- `nums`: A `Counter` object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- `start`: 0.
- `vis`: An empty set.

### Loop Code Analysis:
1. **Condition**: The loop continues as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` is not zero. This means the loop will run as long as there is at least one occurrence of `start` in the list `arr`.
2. **Body**:
   - `vis.add(start)`: Adds the current `start` value to the set `vis`.
   - `nums[start] -= 1`: Decrements the count of `start` in the `nums` counter.
   - **If Statement**:
     - `if nums.get(start + 1, 0)`: Checks if there is at least one occurrence of `start + 1` in the list `arr`.
     - **True Case**:
       - `nums[start + 1] -= 1`: Decrements the count of `start + 1` in the `nums` counter.
       - `start += 1`: Increments `start` by 1.
     - **False Case**:
       - `print(start + 1)`: Prints `start + 1`.
       - `return`: Exits the function.

### Execution Flow:
The loop will start at `start = 0` and will increment `start` as long as there are consecutive integers in `arr`. If it encounters a gap (i.e., `start + 1` does not exist in `arr`), it will print `start + 1` and terminate.

### Output State:
Given the loop's behavior, the loop will terminate when it encounters a number `start` such that `start + 1` does not exist in `arr`. At this point, it will print `start + 1` and return.

### Conclusion:
The output state will be determined by the value of `start + 1` when the loop terminates. Since the loop exits by printing `start + 1` and returning, the final state will reflect the value of `start + 1` at that point.

**Output State: **The loop will print and return `start + 1`, where `start` is the last consecutive integer found in the list `arr` starting from 0.**

In natural language: The output state is the smallest integer greater than the last consecutive integer starting from 0 that is found in the list `arr`. The function will print this integer and then terminate.
