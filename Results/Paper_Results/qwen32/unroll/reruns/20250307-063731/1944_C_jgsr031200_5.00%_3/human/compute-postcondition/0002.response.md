Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and the length of `arr` is `n`; `nums` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`; `start` is 0; `vis` is an empty set.**

In this output state, the variables `arr`, `nums`, and `start` retain their initial values, and a new variable `vis` is introduced as an empty set.
