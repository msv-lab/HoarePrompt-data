The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n` and the length of `arr` is `n`. It prints and returns the smallest integer `k` such that the sequence of integers from `0` to `k-1` can be formed using the elements in `arr`. If the sequence can be formed up to `start`, it prints and returns `start + 1`; otherwise, it prints and returns `start`.
