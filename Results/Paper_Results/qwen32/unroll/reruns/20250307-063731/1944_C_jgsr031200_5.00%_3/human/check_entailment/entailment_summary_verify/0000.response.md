### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob play optimally and hence does not compute the MEX of the final array `c` correctly.

Let's break down the issues and validate the original assessment:

1. **Optimal Strategies Not Considered**:
   - The `func_1` function calculates the MEX based on the initial counts of elements in `arr` without simulating the turns taken by Alice and Bob. 
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX, which means she should strategically choose elements to ensure the MEX is as high as possible. 
   - Bob aims to minimize the MEX, which means he should choose elements to prevent the MEX from increasing.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The `func_1` function simply decrements the counts of elements and determines the MEX based on remaining counts. This does not reflect the game dynamics and strategic choices made by Alice and Bob.

3. **Lack of Game Simulation**:
   - The code processes the array in a single pass without simulating the alternating turns of Alice and Bob. 
   - It does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob make choices based on the current state of the array and the goal to maximize or minimize the MEX, respectively.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns optimally:

- **Alice's Turn**: Alice should pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX.
- **Bob's Turn**: Bob should pick the smallest available number to minimize the MEX.

Here is a corrected version of the code that simulates the game:

```python
import collections as c

def mex(arr):
    i = 0
    while i in arr:
        i += 1
    return i

def game_score(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    turn = 'Alice'
    c = []
    
    while len(c) < n:
        if turn == 'Alice':
            for i in range(n):
                if nums[i] > 0:
                    c.append(i)
                    nums[i] -= 1
                    break
            turn = 'Bob'
        else:
            for i in range(n):
                if nums[i] > 0:
                    nums[i] -= 1
                    break
            turn = 'Alice'
    
    return mex(c)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(game_score(arr))
```

In this corrected version:
- We simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns.
- Alice always picks the smallest available number to maximize the MEX.
- Bob always picks the smallest available number to minimize the MEX.
- After the game is simulated, we calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly simulate the game and does not compute the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
