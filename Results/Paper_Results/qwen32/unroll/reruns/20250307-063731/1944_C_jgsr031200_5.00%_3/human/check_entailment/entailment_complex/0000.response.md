### Reasoning:

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game is played optimally by Alice and Bob. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Counting Elements**: The program uses `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.

2. **Tracking Visited Elements**: A set `vis` is used to keep track of the elements that have been encountered and processed.

3. **Finding the MEX**:
   - The variable `start` is initialized to 0.
   - The program enters a loop where it checks if the current `start` value exists in the `Counter` (`nums`).
   - If it does, it decrements the count of `start` in `nums` and adds `start` to the `vis` set.
   - If the next consecutive number (`start + 1`) also exists in `nums`, it decrements its count and increments `start`.
   - If `start + 1` does not exist, the program breaks out of the loop and prints `start + 1` as the MEX.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, it prints `start` as the MEX.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Optimal Play**: The program does not explicitly simulate the game turns between Alice and Bob, but it correctly computes the MEX based on the final state of the array `c` that results from optimal play.
- **MEX Calculation**: The logic correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the final array `c` by checking consecutive integers starting from 0.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when all elements are the same, when the array contains all integers from 0 to n-1, and when the array contains only one element.

Given the problem constraints and the provided logic, the program correctly computes the MEX for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
