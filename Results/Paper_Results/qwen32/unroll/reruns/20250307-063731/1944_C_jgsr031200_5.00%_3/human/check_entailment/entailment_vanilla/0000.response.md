To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze its logic and see if it aligns with the problem description and requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Find the MEX of the array `c` after both Alice and Bob play optimally.
- **Alice's Strategy**: Maximize the MEX.
- **Bob's Strategy**: Minimize the MEX.
- **Game Rules**:
  - Alice starts by picking an element from `a` and appending it to `c`, then deletes it from `a`.
  - Bob picks an element from `a` and deletes it from `a`.
  - The game ends when `a` is empty.
  - The MEX of `c` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself. It then calls `func_1(arr)` to determine the MEX of `c` after the game ends.

#### Function `func_1(arr)`:
1. **Count Elements**: It uses `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
2. **Simulate Game**: 
   - It initializes `start` to 0 and `vis` (visited) as an empty set.
   - It enters a loop where it checks if `start` is in `nums` (the count dictionary). If it is, it adds `start` to `vis` and decrements its count in `nums`.
   - If `start + 1` is also in `nums`, it decrements its count and increments `start` (indicating that both `start` and `start + 1` can be part of `c`).
   - If `start + 1` is not in `nums`, it prints `start + 1` and exits the loop (indicating that `start + 1` is the MEX of `c`).

### Key Points:
- The program correctly counts the elements and simulates the game by checking the presence of consecutive integers starting from 0.
- The logic ensures that the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c` is found and printed, which is the MEX of `c`.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `n = 4`, `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
   - The MEX of `c` should be 2.
   - The program correctly identifies 2 as the MEX.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `n = 4`, `arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
   - The MEX of `c` should be 1.
   - The program correctly identifies 1 as the MEX.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `n = 2`, `arr = [1, 1]`
   - The MEX of `c` should be 0.
   - The program correctly identifies 0 as the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of `c` after the game ends, considering the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

Correctness: **True**
