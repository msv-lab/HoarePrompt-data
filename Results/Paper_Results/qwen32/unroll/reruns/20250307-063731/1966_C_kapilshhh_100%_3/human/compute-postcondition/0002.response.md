Output State: **tc is 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `tc` (which represents the number of test cases) will be reduced to 0. This is because the loop decrements `tc` by 1 in each iteration until `tc` becomes 0, at which point the loop terminates. The values of other variables such as `n`, `arr`, and `dp` are local to each iteration and do not persist after the loop ends.
