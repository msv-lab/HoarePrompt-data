To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `tc > 0` is satisfied. The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one.

Given that `tc` is an integer representing the number of test cases, which is read from the input, we need to ensure that `tc` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `tc` is greater than 0.

State: **`tc` is an integer representing the number of test cases, which is read from the input and must be greater than 0. The initial state regarding the number of piles (`n`) and the number of stones in each pile (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) remains unchanged.**
