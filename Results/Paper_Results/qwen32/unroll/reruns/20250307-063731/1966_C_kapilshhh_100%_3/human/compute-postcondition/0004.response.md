Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of piles and the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it determines the winner of a game where two players take turns removing stones from the piles, with the rule that a player can only remove stones from a pile if it has more stones than the next pile, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The function outputs 'Alice' if Alice wins the game and 'Bob' if Bob wins.**
