Output State: **`tc` is an integer representing the number of test cases, which is read from the input. The initial state regarding the number of piles (`n`) and the number of stones in each pile (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) remains unchanged.**

Natural language: The variable `tc` is now assigned the integer value input by the user, representing the number of test cases. The other variables related to the number of piles (`n`) and the stones in each pile (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) are still in their initial state as described in the problem statement.
