Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The game is essentially a variant of the Nim game, and the winner can be determined by the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones after removing duplicates. The provided code does not correctly implement this logic.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        odd_count = sum(1 for x in arr if x % 2 == 1)
        print('Alice' if odd_count % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
        tc -= 1

func()
```

This corrected version counts the number of piles with an odd number of stones and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even. If the count is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
