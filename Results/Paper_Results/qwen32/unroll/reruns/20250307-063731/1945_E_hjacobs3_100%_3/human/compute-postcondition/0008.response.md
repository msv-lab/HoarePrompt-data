Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet provided:

### Initial State:
1. `l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`.
2. `r` is `l + 1`.
3. `l` is also explicitly defined as `array.index(find)`, which finds the first occurrence of `find` in `array`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(0)`. This statement will print the integer `0` regardless of the values of `l`, `r`, `array`, or `find`.

### Explanation:
- The value to be printed is explicitly `0`.
- The variables `l` and `r` are defined based on the conditions provided, but they do not influence the `print` statement.
- The `array` and `find` are also part of the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
