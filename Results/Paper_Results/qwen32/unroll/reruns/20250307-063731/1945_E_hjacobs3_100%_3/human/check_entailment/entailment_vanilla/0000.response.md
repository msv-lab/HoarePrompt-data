Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to rearrange a permutation `p` of size `n` so that after performing a binary search for a number `x`, the element at position `l` after the binary search ends is equal to `x`. We can perform up to two swaps to achieve this. The binary search algorithm provided is a standard binary search algorithm.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the permutation) and `x` (the number to be found).
   - It then reads the permutation `array` of length `n`.

2. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search is implemented in the `func_1` function.
   - The variables `l` and `r` are initialized to `0` and `n` respectively.
   - The loop runs until `r - l > 1`.
   - The middle index `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
   - If `array[mid] <= x`, `l` is updated to `mid`; otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid`.
   - After the loop, the program checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `x` in the array. If they are not equal, it prints `1` and the indices to swap to make `array[l]` equal to `x`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the number of swaps performed and the indices to swap, if any.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Binary Search Off-by-One Error:**
   - The binary search implementation in the program has an off-by-one error. The variable `r` is initialized to `n`, but the array indices in Python are 0-based. The correct initialization should be `r = n - 1`.

2. **Handling of Multiple Swaps:**
   - The problem states that up to two swaps can be performed, but the program only considers one swap if `l` is not equal to the index of `x`. The program does not handle cases where more than one swap is needed.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the number of swaps and the indices to swap directly from the `func_1` function. However, the problem requires the output to be formatted correctly, and the program does not handle this properly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the permutation is already sorted or where the number of swaps needed is exactly two.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem statement. It has several issues, including off-by-one errors in the binary search, incorrect handling of multiple swaps, and improper output formatting. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
