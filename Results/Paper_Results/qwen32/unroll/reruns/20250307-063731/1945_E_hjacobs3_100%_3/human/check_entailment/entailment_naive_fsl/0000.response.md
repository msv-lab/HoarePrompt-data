Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description. Specifically, the program does not perform the binary search algorithm as described and does not ensure that after performing at most 2 swaps, the element at position `l` (where `l` is the final left pointer after the binary search) is equal to `x`.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search implementation is incorrect. The condition `while r - l > 1` is correct, but the logic for updating `l` and `r` is flawed.
   - The code does not correctly identify the position where `p_l` should be equal to `x` after the binary search.
   - The code does not attempt to perform the required swaps to achieve this.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The code only performs a single swap if the current `l` is not the index of `x` in the array.
   - The code does not attempt to perform a second swap if needed.
   - The code does not ensure that after performing the swaps, the binary search will result in `p_l` being equal to `x`.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
The correct output should be:
```
2
2 4
1 5
```
Explanation:
- Initially, the array is `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]`.
- After the first swap (2, 4), the array becomes `[4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6]`.
- After the second swap (1, 5), the array becomes `[2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 6]`.
- Performing the binary search on this array will result in `p_l` being equal to `3`.

However, the provided code will only perform one swap and may not result in the correct final array configuration.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to perform at most 2 swaps and ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
