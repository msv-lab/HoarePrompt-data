### Reasoning:
Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**: A permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find within the permutation.
2. **Task**: Perform at most 2 swaps on the permutation to ensure that after applying a binary search algorithm, the element at position `l` is equal to `x`.
3. **Binary Search Algorithm**:
   - Initialize `l = 0` and `r = n`.
   - While `r - l > 1`, calculate `m = (r + l) // 2`.
   - If `p[m] <= x`, set `l = m`; otherwise, set `r = m`.
4. **Output**: The number of swaps performed (0, 1, or 2) and the indices of the elements swapped.

#### Provided Program:
The provided program appears to be incomplete and incorrect for the problem requirements. Hereâ€™s why:
- The function `func_1` does not perform any swaps on the array.
- It only determines the index `l` after the binary search loop and compares it with the index of the first occurrence of `x`.
- If they are not the same, it suggests a single swap but does not actually perform the swap or ensure the binary search will yield the correct result after the swap.
- The binary search logic is correct, but the program does not address the requirement to make the array such that after the binary search, `p[l] == x`.

#### Correctness Analysis:
The program does not attempt to perform the necessary swaps to make the array suitable for the binary search algorithm to find `x` correctly. It only checks if a single swap would be needed and prints the indices without actually making the swap. This does not meet the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not perform the required swaps to ensure the binary search will find `x` correctly.

**Correctness: False**
