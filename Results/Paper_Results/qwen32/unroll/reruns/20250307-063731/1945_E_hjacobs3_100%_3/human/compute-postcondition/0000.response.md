The variable `n` is assigned the length of the list `array`, which represents the length of the permutation. The values of `array` and `find` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, and `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`; `n` is the length of `array`.**
