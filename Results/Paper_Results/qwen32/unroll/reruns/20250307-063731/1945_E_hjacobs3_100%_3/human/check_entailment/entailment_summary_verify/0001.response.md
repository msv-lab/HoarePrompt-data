Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its behavior based on the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to rearrange a permutation `p` of size `n` so that after performing a binary search for a number `x`, the element at position `l` after the binary search ends is equal to `x`. We can perform up to two swaps to achieve this.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the permutation) and `x` (the number to be found).
   - It then reads the permutation `array` of length `n`.

2. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search is implemented in the `func_1` function.
   - The variables `l` and `r` are initialized to `0` and `n` respectively.
   - The loop runs until `r - l > 1`.
   - The middle index `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
   - If `array[mid] <= x`, `l` is updated to `mid`; otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid`.
   - After the loop, the program checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `x` in the array. If they are not equal, it prints `1` and the indices to swap to make `array[l]` equal to `x`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Binary Search Off-by-One Error:**
   - The binary search implementation in the program has an off-by-one error. The variable `r` is initialized to `n`, but the array indices in Python are 0-based. The correct initialization should be `r = n`.

2. **Handling of Multiple Swaps:**
   - The problem states that up to two swaps can be performed, but the program only considers one swap if `l` is not equal to the index of `x`. The program does not handle cases where more than one swap is needed.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the number of swaps and the indices to swap directly from the `func_1` function. However, the problem requires the output to be formatted correctly, and the program does not handle this properly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the permutation is already sorted or where the number of swaps needed is exactly two.

### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary states that `func_1` returns a list of two strings: the first string is the 1-based index of the largest position in `array` where the value is less than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the 1-based index of the first occurrence of `find` in `array`. If the largest index `l` such that `array[l] <= find` is not the same as the index of the first occurrence of `find`, it prints `1`; otherwise, it prints `0`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem statement. Here are the reasons:

1. **Off-by-One Error in Binary Search:**
   - The variable `r` is initialized to `n`, which is incorrect for 0-based indexing. It should be `n - 1`.

2. **Handling of Multiple Swaps:**
   - The program does not consider the possibility of needing two swaps to achieve the desired result.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program does not correctly format the output as required by the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the permutation is already sorted or when exactly two swaps are needed.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct.

Final: **False**
