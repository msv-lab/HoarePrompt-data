To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the condition in the loop head: `r - l > 1`.

- `r` is initialized to `n`, which is the length of the list `array`.
- `l` is initialized to `0`.

For the loop to execute, the condition `r - l > 1` must be true. Given the initial values:
- `r` is `n`
- `l` is `0`

The condition `r - l > 1` translates to `n - 0 > 1`, or simply `n > 1`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure that it is greater than 1. No other states (`array` or `find`) need to be adjusted because they do not directly affect the loop condition.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, `find` is an integer such that `1 <= find <= n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 1**
