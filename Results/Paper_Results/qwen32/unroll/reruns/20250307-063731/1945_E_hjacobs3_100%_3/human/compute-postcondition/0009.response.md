Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and a parameter `find`, which is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n. It returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the position (1-based index) of the largest index `l` such that `array[l]` is less than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the position (1-based index) of the first occurrence of `find` in the `array`.**
