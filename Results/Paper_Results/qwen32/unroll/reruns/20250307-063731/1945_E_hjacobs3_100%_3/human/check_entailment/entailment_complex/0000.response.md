### Reasoning:

The given program aims to rearrange the permutation array in such a way that after performing a binary search, the element at index `l` is equal to `x`. The binary search algorithm is modified to find the largest index `l` such that `array[l] <= x` and then checks if `array[l]` is equal to `x`.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the provided code:

1. **Input Parsing:** The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the target value `x`. It then reads the permutation array.

2. **Binary Search Implementation:** The function `func_1` performs a binary search on the array to find the largest index `l` such that `array[l] <= x`. If `array[l]` is not equal to `x`, it suggests swapping elements to make `array[l]` equal to `x`.

3. **Swapping Logic:** If `l` is not equal to the index of the first occurrence of `x` in the array, the program prints `1` and suggests swapping the elements at indices `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1` to make `array[l]` equal to `x`. If `l` is already the index of `x`, it prints `0`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Binary Search Indexing:** The binary search is implemented with `l` and `r` initialized to `0` and `n` respectively. However, this is incorrect because array indices in Python are zero-based, and the binary search should be performed on indices `0` to `n-1`. The current implementation will lead to incorrect results because `r` is `n` (out of bounds).

2. **Swapping Logic:** The swapping logic is intended to make `array[l]` equal to `x` by swapping `array[l]` with `array[array.index(find)]`. However, this logic does not guarantee that the binary search will correctly identify `x` after the swap because the array might not be sorted in a way that satisfies the binary search property.

3. **Output Format:** The function is supposed to return a list of strings representing the operations, but the current implementation prints the number of operations directly. The return value should be a list of strings, not printed directly.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the binary search indexing, the swapping logic, and the output format, the program is not correct as per the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
