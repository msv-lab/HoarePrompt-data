Output State: **The program returns [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)], where l is the largest index such that array[l] <= find, and array.index(find) is the index of the first occurrence of find in the array.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the value of `l + 1`, and the second string is the index of the first occurrence of `find` in the array, both incremented by 1.
