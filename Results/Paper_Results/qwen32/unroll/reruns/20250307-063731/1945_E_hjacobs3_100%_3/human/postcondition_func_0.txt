The function accepts a list of integers `array` representing a permutation and an integer `find`. It returns a list of two strings: the first string is the 1-based index of the largest position in `array` where the value is less than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the 1-based index of the first occurrence of `find` in `array`. If the largest index `l` such that `array[l] <= find` is not the same as the index of the first occurrence of `find`, it prints `1`; otherwise, it prints `0`.
