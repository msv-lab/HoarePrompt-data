Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program is supposed to rearrange the permutation array using at most 2 swaps before performing a binary search, such that after the search, the element at the final `l` position is equal to `x`. However, the current implementation only performs a single swap when needed and does not guarantee that the binary search will terminate with `p_l` equal to `x`.

Here are some issues with the current implementation:
1. It only performs one swap if necessary, but the problem guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient.
2. The logic for determining when and how to swap elements is not comprehensive enough to ensure that the binary search will correctly find `x`.
3. The function `func_1` is supposed to return the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps, but it only handles the case where one swap is needed. It does not handle the case where no swaps are needed or where two swaps are needed.

To fix the program, a more sophisticated approach is required to ensure that the array can be rearranged correctly with at most two swaps.
