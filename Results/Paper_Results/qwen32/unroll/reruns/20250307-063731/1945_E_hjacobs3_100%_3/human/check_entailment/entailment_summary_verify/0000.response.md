### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary in the context of the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x`.
- We can perform at most 2 swaps to make the binary search on `p` end with `p_l` equal to `x`.
- The binary search is performed as follows:
  1. Initialize `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`.
  2. Loop until `r - l = 1`.
  3. Compute `m = floor((r + l) / 2)`.
  4. If `p_m <= x`, set `l = m`; otherwise, set `r = m`.
- The goal is to have `p_l = x` after the binary search.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of a main loop that processes multiple test cases and a function `func_1` that handles the logic for each test case. Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Main Loop**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, reads `n` and `x`, and the permutation `array`.
   - Calls `func_1(array, x)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Initializes `l = 0` and `r = n`.
   - Performs a binary search to find the largest index `l` such that `array[l] <= x`.
   - Checks if the found `l` is not equal to the index of the first occurrence of `x` in `array`.
   - If not equal, it prints `1` and returns the indices for a single swap to bring `x` to the correct position.
   - If equal, it prints `0`.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary states that `func_1`:
- Accepts a list `array` and an integer `find`.
- Returns a list of two strings representing indices for a swap if needed.
- Prints `1` if a swap is needed, otherwise prints `0`.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search logic is correct in terms of finding the largest index `l` such that `array[l] <= x`.
   - However, it does not ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The code only performs a single swap if `l` is not the index of `x`.
   - It does not attempt to perform a second swap if needed.
   - It does not ensure that after performing the swaps, the binary search will result in `p_l` being equal to `x`.

3. **Handling Multiple Swaps**:
   - The problem allows up to 2 swaps, but the code only handles at most 1 swap.
   - This is a critical issue because it may not be possible to achieve `p_l = x` with just one swap in some cases.

#### Example Case Analysis:
Consider the example:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
The correct output should be:
```
2
2 4
1 5
```
Explanation:
- Initially, the array is `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]`.
- After the first swap (2, 4), the array becomes `[4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6]`.
- After the second swap (1, 5), the array becomes `[2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 6]`.
- Performing the binary search on this array will result in `p_l` being equal to `3`.

However, the provided code will only perform one swap and may not result in the correct final array configuration.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to perform at most 2 swaps and ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
