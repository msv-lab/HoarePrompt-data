The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `l` and the value `n` to the variable `r`. The initial state specifies that `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, and `find` is an integer such that `1 <= find <= n`. These conditions remain unchanged. The only changes are the values of `l` and `r`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, `find` is an integer such that `1 <= find <= n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`.**
