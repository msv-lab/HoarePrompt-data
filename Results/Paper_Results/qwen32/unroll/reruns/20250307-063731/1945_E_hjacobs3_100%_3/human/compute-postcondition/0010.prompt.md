You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and find is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: l is the largest index such that array[l] <= find, and r is l + 1.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)], where l is the largest index such that array[l] <= find, and array.index(find) is the index of the first occurrence of find in the array.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`, and `r` is `l + 1`. `l` is equal to `array.index(find)`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and a parameter `find`, which is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n. It returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the position (1-based index) of the largest index `l` such that `array[l]` is less than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the position (1-based index) of the first occurrence of `find` in the `array`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)], where l is the largest index such that array[l] <= find, and array.index(find) is the index of the first occurrence of find in the array.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
