To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's break down the problem step by step.

Given:
- Initial State: `size` is 9, `sequence` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], `result` is the output of `func_1(number - 511, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])`.

For the sake of this problem, let's assume `func_1(number - 511, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])` returns a value that will be used as `result`. However, since the actual definition of `func_1` is not provided, we need to infer its impact based on the loop's behavior.

The loop iterates `size` times (9 times in this case). In each iteration, it modifies the `sequence` list based on the `result` value.

Let's assume `func_1` returns a value `result`. The loop modifies the `sequence` list in the following way:
- For `i = 0`, it modifies `sequence[-result - 0 - 1]` which is `sequence[-result - 1]`.
- For `i = 1`, it modifies `sequence[-result - 1 - 1]` which is `sequence[-result - 2]`.
- And so on...

Since the exact value of `result` is not provided, let's assume `result` is a small integer to see how the loop behaves. For simplicity, let's assume `result` is 0 (the smallest possible non-negative integer that makes sense in this context).

If `result` is 0:
- For `i = 0`, it modifies `sequence[-0 - 1]` which is `sequence[-1]` (the last element of the list).
- For `i = 1`, it modifies `sequence[-0 - 2]` which is `sequence[-2]` (the second last element of the list).
- And so on...

So, if `result` is 0, the loop will add 0 to each of the last 9 elements of the `sequence` list, which means the `sequence` list will remain unchanged.

However, since the problem does not specify the exact value of `result`, let's assume `result` is a value that affects the sequence. For example, if `result` is 1:
- For `i = 0`, it modifies `sequence[-1 - 1]` which is `sequence[-2]`.
- For `i = 1`, it modifies `sequence[-1 - 2]` which is `sequence[-3]`.
- And so on...

If `result` is 1, the loop will add 1 to the last 9 elements of the `sequence` list in reverse order.

Let's assume `result` is 1 for the sake of this example. The sequence will be modified as follows:
- `sequence[-2]` becomes `sequence[-2] + 1` (7 becomes 8)
- `sequence[-3]` becomes `sequence[-3] + 1` (6 becomes 7)
- `sequence[-4]` becomes `sequence[-4] + 1` (5 becomes 6)
- `sequence[-5]` becomes `sequence[-5] + 1` (4 becomes 5)
- `sequence[-6]` becomes `sequence[-6] + 1` (3 becomes 4)
- `sequence[-7]` becomes `sequence[-7] + 1` (2 becomes 3)
- `sequence[-8]` becomes `sequence[-8] + 1` (1 becomes 2)
- `sequence[-9]` becomes `sequence[-9] + 1` (0 becomes 1)
- `sequence[-10]` is out of bounds, but since `size` is 9, it doesn't affect the sequence.

So, if `result` is 1, the final sequence will be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

Since the exact value of `result` is not provided, let's assume the simplest case where `result` is 0, and the sequence remains unchanged.

Output State: **size is 9, sequence is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], result is 0.**

However, if we assume `result` is 1 for the sake of this example, the output state would be:

Output State: **size is 9, sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], result is 1.**

Since the exact value of `result` is not provided, we will assume the simplest case where `result` is 0, and the sequence remains unchanged.

Output State: **size is 9, sequence is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], result is 0.**

Let's confirm this with the code assuming `result` is 0.
```python
# Initial state
size = 9
sequence = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
result = 0  # Assuming result is 0 for the simplest case

# Loop execution
for i in range(size):
    sequence[-result - i - 1] += result

# Output state
output_state = f"size is {size}, sequence is {sequence}, result is {result}"
print(output_state)
```
```output
size is 9, sequence is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], result is 0
```
The output state after the loop executes all the iterations, assuming `result` is 0, is:

Output State: **size is 9, sequence is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], result is 0.**

This confirms that the sequence remains unchanged when `result` is 0. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{Output State: size is 9, sequence is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], result is 0.}}
