### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function `func_1` to determine if it correctly generates an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences as per the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need an array of integers with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
- If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.
- The array length should be at most 200.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Main Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `X` and initializes an empty list `result`.
   - It calls `func_1` with `n - 1` (where `n` is `X`) and the `result` list.
   - The function `func_1` modifies `result` and returns its size.
   - The program prints the length of `result` and the sequence itself.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.
   - It calculates the largest `size` such that `(1 << (size + 1)) - 1` (i.e., `2^(size+1) - 1`) is less than or equal to `number`.
   - It appends values from `0` to `size - 1` to `sequence`.
   - It recursively calls itself with `number - (1 << size) + 1` (i.e., `number - 2^size + 1`).
   - After recursion, it adjusts the last `size` elements of `sequence` by adding the result of the recursive call.

#### Function Summary:
- `func_1` generates a sequence based on the input `number` and appends values to `sequence`.
- It returns the size of the generated sequence, which is used to adjust and extend the sequence recursively.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- **Generating the Sequence:**
  - The function `func_1` uses a binary-like approach to generate the sequence. It leverages the fact that the number of increasing subsequences can be represented in a binary fashion.
  - The sequence generated by `func_1` is such that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - For `X = 2`, the sequence `[0]` is generated, which indeed has `2` increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing `0`.
  - For larger values of `X`, the function recursively constructs the sequence to ensure the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.

- **Output:**
  - The program outputs the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
  - The function does not explicitly handle cases where no such sequence can be generated, but theoretically, for valid `X` within the given constraints, such a sequence should exist.

#### Verification:
- The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that corresponds to `X` increasing subsequences.
- The recursive approach ensures that the sequence is constructed correctly.
- The function summary aligns with the behavior of `func_1`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly generate an array of integers such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences for valid inputs within the given constraints. The logic in `func_1` ensures that the sequence is constructed correctly to meet the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
