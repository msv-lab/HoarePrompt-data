Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly generate an array with exactly X increasing subsequences for all possible values of X within the given constraints. Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to generate such an array, but it does not handle the full range of possible X values (from 2 to 10^18) correctly.

The approach in the code seems to be based on generating sequences using binary representation and recursive calls, which is not a straightforward or guaranteed method to produce the correct array for all X. The code also does not handle cases where it is impossible to construct such an array, which should return -1.

To solve this problem correctly, one would need a more robust method to construct arrays that yield the exact number of increasing subsequences required by X, potentially involving dynamic programming or combinatorial constructions. The current implementation is incomplete and does not cover all edge cases or provide correct results for the full input range.
