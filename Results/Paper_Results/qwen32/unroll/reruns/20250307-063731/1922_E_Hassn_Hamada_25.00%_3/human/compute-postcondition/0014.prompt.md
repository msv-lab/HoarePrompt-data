You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and sequence is a list of positive integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case.
def func_1(number, sequence):
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 

    Returns: 
        int: The size of generated sequence
    """
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `number` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence` is a list of positive integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case. Additionally, `number` is not equal to 0.
    size = 1
    while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
        size += 1
        
    #State: size = 9.
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
        
    #State: size = 9, sequence = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
        
    #State: size is 9, sequence is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], result is 0.
    return size + result
    #The program returns 9
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `sequence`, a list of positive integers where each integer X represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case. The function has two cases for its return value: Case_1, where the function returns 0; Case_2, where the function returns 9.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns 9


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
