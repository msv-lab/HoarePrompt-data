You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given Python program is correct based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic and functionality of the code step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. If no such array exists, the program should output `-1`. The program provided appears to generate such an array based on the input value `X`.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Main Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `X` and initializes an empty list `result` to store the generated sequence.
   - It calls `func_1` with `n - 1` (where `n` is `X`) and the `result` list. The function `func_1` generates the sequence and returns its size.
   - The program then prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes an integer `number` and a list `sequence` as arguments.
   - It ensures that `number` is non-negative.
   - If `number` is `0`, it returns `0`.
   - It calculates the largest integer `size` such that `(1 << (size + 1)) - 1` (which is `2^(size+1) - 1`) is less than or equal to `number`.
   - It appends the integers from `0` to `size - 1` to the `sequence`.
   - It recursively calls itself with the argument `number - (1 << size) + 1` (which is `number - 2^size + 1`) and the same `sequence`.
   - After the recursive call, it modifies the last `size` elements of the `sequence` by adding the result of the recursive call to them.
   - It returns the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call.

### Correctness Check:
- **Generating the Sequence:**
  - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that corresponds to the number of increasing subsequences specified by `X`.
  - The sequence is constructed in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `X` is `2` by generating a sequence of length `1` (e.g., `[0]`), which indeed has `2` increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element.
  - For larger values of `X`, the function recursively constructs the sequence, ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

- **Output:**
  - The program outputs the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
  - If no such sequence can be generated (which theoretically shouldn't happen given the constraints), the program would need to handle that case explicitly, but the current implementation does not include such a check.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly generate an array of integers such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic in `func_1` ensures that the sequence is constructed correctly to meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
