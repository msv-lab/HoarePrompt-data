The provided code snippet is a function definition without an actual function body or any code that modifies the `number` or `sequence` variables. Therefore, the `number` and `sequence` variables remain unchanged. Since there is no code to execute, no calculations or changes occur to the initial state.

Output State: **`number` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence` is a list of positive integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case.**
