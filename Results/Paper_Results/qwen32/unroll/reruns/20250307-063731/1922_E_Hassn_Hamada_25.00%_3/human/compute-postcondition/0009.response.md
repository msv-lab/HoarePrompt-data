To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state:

Initial State: `size = 9`, `sequence = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`

The code snippet is:
```python
result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
```

Here, `number` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its specific value. However, we can still express the result in terms of `number`.

The expression `(1 << size)` is a bitwise left shift operation, which shifts the number `1` to the left by `size` positions. Since `size` is `9`, this operation results in `1 << 9` which equals `512`.

Thus, the expression `number - (1 << size) + 1` simplifies to `number - 512 + 1`, or `number - 511`.

The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `number - 511` and `sequence`. The result of this function call is stored in the variable `result`.

Since the function `func_1` and its behavior are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the function call and the variables.

Output State: **`size` is 9, `sequence` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], `result` is the output of `func_1(number - 511, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `size` remains 9, `sequence` remains [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], and `result` is determined by the function `func_1` called with the arguments `number - 511` and the `sequence`.
