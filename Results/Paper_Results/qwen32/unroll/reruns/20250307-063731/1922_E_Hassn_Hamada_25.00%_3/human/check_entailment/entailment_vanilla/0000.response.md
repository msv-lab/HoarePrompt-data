To determine if the given Python program is correct based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic and functionality of the code step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. If no such array exists, the program should output `-1`. The program provided appears to generate such an array based on the input value `X`.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Main Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `X` and initializes an empty list `result` to store the generated sequence.
   - It calls `func_1` with `n - 1` (where `n` is `X`) and the `result` list. The function `func_1` generates the sequence and returns its size.
   - The program then prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes an integer `number` and a list `sequence` as arguments.
   - It ensures that `number` is non-negative.
   - If `number` is `0`, it returns `0`.
   - It calculates the largest integer `size` such that `(1 << (size + 1)) - 1` (which is `2^(size+1) - 1`) is less than or equal to `number`.
   - It appends the integers from `0` to `size - 1` to the `sequence`.
   - It recursively calls itself with the argument `number - (1 << size) + 1` (which is `number - 2^size + 1`) and the same `sequence`.
   - After the recursive call, it modifies the last `size` elements of the `sequence` by adding the result of the recursive call to them.
   - It returns the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call.

### Correctness Check:
- **Generating the Sequence:**
  - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that corresponds to the number of increasing subsequences specified by `X`.
  - The sequence is constructed in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `X` is `2` by generating a sequence of length `1` (e.g., `[0]`), which indeed has `2` increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element.
  - For larger values of `X`, the function recursively constructs the sequence, ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

- **Output:**
  - The program outputs the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
  - If no such sequence can be generated (which theoretically shouldn't happen given the constraints), the program would need to handle that case explicitly, but the current implementation does not include such a check.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly generate an array of integers such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic in `func_1` ensures that the sequence is constructed correctly to meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
