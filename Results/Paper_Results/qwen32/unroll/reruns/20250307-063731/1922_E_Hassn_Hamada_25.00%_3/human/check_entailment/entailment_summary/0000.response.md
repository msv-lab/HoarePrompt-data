### Reasoning:

The problem requires generating an array such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences. The provided program attempts to solve this problem by using a recursive function `func_1` to generate a sequence based on the input number `X - 1`. The function works by determining the size of the sequence and then adjusting the sequence values based on a binary representation of the input number.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Base Case**: If the input `number` is 0, the function returns 0, indicating that no elements are added to the sequence.
2. **Determine Size**: The function calculates the size of the sequence by finding the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number + 1`. This is done using a loop that increments `size` until `(1 << (size + 1)) - 1` is greater than `number`.
3. **Append Initial Elements**: The function appends `size` elements (from 0 to `size-1`) to the `sequence` list.
4. **Recursive Call**: The function calls itself recursively with the adjusted value `number - (1 << size) + 1` and the same `sequence` list.
5. **Adjust Sequence Values**: After the recursive call, the function adjusts the last `size` elements of the `sequence` list by adding the result of the recursive call to each of these elements.

The program then prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself. The key aspect here is whether this sequence indeed generates exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

The approach taken by the program is based on the binary representation of the number `X - 1` and generating a sequence that corresponds to this binary representation. This is a known method to generate sequences with a specific number of increasing subsequences, and the provided code seems to implement this method correctly.

However, the problem statement specifies that the length of the array should be at most 200, and the program does not explicitly check this condition. Nonetheless, the method used should inherently generate sequences of reasonable length for the given constraints (since the number of increasing subsequences grows exponentially with the length of the sequence).

### Conclusion:
Given the logic and the method used, the program appears to be correct in generating a sequence with the desired number of increasing subsequences. The provided execution summary and the structure of the code support this conclusion.

**Correctness: True**
