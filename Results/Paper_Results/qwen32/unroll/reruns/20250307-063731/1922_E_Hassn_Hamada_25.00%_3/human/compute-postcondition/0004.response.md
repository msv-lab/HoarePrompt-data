The code snippet `size = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `size`. The other variables, `number` and `sequence`, are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`number` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), `sequence` is a list of positive integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case, and `size` is 1.**
