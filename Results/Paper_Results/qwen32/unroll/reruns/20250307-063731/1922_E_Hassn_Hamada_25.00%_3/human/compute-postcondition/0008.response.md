To determine the output state after the loop has executed, we need to understand the operations performed within the loop. The loop iterates `size` times, and in each iteration, it appends the current loop variable `i` to the list `sequence`. Given the initial state `size = 9`, the loop will iterate 9 times, with `i` taking values from 0 to 8.

Here's how the loop executes:
- On the first iteration, `i = 0`, so `0` is appended to `sequence`.
- On the second iteration, `i = 1`, so `1` is appended to `sequence`.
- This continues until the ninth iteration, where `i = 8`, so `8` is appended to `sequence`.

Thus, after the loop finishes, `sequence` will contain the numbers from 0 to 8.

Output State: **size = 9, sequence = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]**.
