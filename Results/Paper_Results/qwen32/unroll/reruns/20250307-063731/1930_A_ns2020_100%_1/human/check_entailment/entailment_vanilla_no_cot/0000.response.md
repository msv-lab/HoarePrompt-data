Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the strategy to achieve the maximum final score by always pairing the smallest available numbers. By sorting the list of numbers and then summing every second element starting from the first (which are the smallest elements due to sorting), the program ensures that the minimum of each pair is added to the score, thereby maximizing the score as required by the problem statement.
