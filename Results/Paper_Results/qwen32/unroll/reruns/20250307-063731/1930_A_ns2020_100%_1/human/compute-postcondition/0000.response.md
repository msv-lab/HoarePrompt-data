The code provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer within the range 1 to 5000, and for each test case, there is an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. The code snippet only updates the value of `t` by reading a new input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.**

In natural language: The value of `t` has been updated to the new input integer, while the conditions for `n` and the list of integers remain the same as initially described.
