### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to maximize the score by picking pairs of integers from the list, adding the minimum of each pair to the score, and repeating this process until all integers are used up. The optimal strategy to maximize the score is to always pair the smallest available integers together because this will always add the maximum possible minimum value to the score.

The given program follows this optimal strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers.
4. It then sums up the elements at even indices of the sorted list. This is equivalent to picking the smallest available integers in pairs and adding the smaller one (which will always be the one at the even index in the sorted list).

The sum of the elements at even indices in the sorted list gives us the maximum possible score because:
- Sorting ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together.
- Summing the elements at even indices gives us the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair.

Thus, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy to solve the problem.
