You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        A.sort()
        
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State: A series of sums, each on a new line, corresponding to the sum of elements at even indices of the sorted list for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It sorts the list and then calculates and prints the sum of the elements at even indices of the sorted list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score by optimally performing the n moves as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array `A` of integers. Sorting ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values of each pair.

2. **Summing Every Second Element**: After sorting, the program sums every second element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`). This is because, in a sorted array, the smallest element of each pair will be at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating through the number of test cases `t` and processing each test case independently.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as the smallest possible value of `n` (which is 1) and the largest possible value of `n` (which is 50). It also correctly processes arrays with repeated elements, as demonstrated in the third example.

Since the program correctly implements the logic for all potential cases, it meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
