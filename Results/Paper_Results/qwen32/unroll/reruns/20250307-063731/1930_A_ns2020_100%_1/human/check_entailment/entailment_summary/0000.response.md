### Reasoning:
To solve the problem optimally, we need to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers in such a way that we maximize the sum of the minimums of these pairs. 

Given that we have to perform exactly `n` moves and each move involves selecting two integers `x` and `y` and adding `min(x, y)` to the score, the best strategy is to sort the list of integers in ascending order.

When the list is sorted, the smallest `n` numbers will be at the beginning of the list. By pairing these smallest numbers together, we ensure that we are always adding the smallest possible value to the score in each move. Specifically, if we take the sorted list and sum every second element starting from the first element (i.e., elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2), we will get the maximum possible score.

The provided program follows this strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers.
4. It calculates the sum of the elements at even indices (which correspond to the smallest numbers in the sorted list).
5. It prints the sum, which is the maximum score for that test case.

Since the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for solving the problem as described, it is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
