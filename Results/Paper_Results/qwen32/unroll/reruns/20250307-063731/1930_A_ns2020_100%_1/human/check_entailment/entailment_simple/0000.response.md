### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to maximize the final score by performing the given operation `n` times, where each operation involves selecting two integers, adding the smaller one to the score, and erasing both from the whiteboard. The key to maximizing the score is to always pair the smallest possible numbers together because adding the smaller number in each pair to the score will yield the highest total score.

The provided program correctly implements this strategy:
1. **Input Reading:** The program first reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
2. **Sorting:** The list of integers is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Score Calculation:** The program calculates the score by summing up the elements at even indices of the sorted list. This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest numbers are at the beginning, and pairing them up (i.e., taking every second element starting from the first) ensures that the smaller number in each pair is added to the score.
4. **Output:** The program prints the calculated score for each test case.

The provided execution states in the comments align with the expected behavior of the program. For each test case, the program outputs the correct maximum final score by following the described approach.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to achieve the maximum final score and handles multiple test cases as required.

**Correctness: True**
