Reasoning:  
To solve the problem of maximizing the final score by performing the described operations optimally, we need to carefully analyze the strategy to choose pairs of integers and add the minimum of each pair to the score.

Given that we need to perform exactly n moves and each move involves selecting two integers and adding the smaller one to the score, the optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest available integers together. This is because, by doing so, we ensure that we are always adding the smallest possible values to our score, thereby maximizing the score.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program first reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in non-decreasing order. This ensures that the smallest integers are at the beginning of the list.

3. **Pairing and Summing**: The program then pairs the integers by taking every second element starting from the first element (i.e., `A[0]`, `A[2]`, `A[4]`, ..., `A[2n-2]`), which are the smallest elements in each pair when the list is sorted. It sums these elements to get the maximum possible score.

4. **Output**: For each test case, the program outputs the computed score.

The strategy of sorting and summing every second element from the start of the list is optimal because it ensures that we are always adding the smaller element of each pair to the score, which leads to the maximum possible score.

Therefore, the provided program correctly implements the optimal strategy to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
