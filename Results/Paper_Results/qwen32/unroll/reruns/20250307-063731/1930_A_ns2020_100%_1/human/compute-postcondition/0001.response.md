The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is truthy (i.e., not zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `t` must be a non-zero integer.

State: **`t` must be a non-zero integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7**
