The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of elements in a list `a` and `k` is another integer. The list `a` contains `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function processes these inputs and returns a value for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a value for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
