The provided code snippet does not contain any executable Python code; it only includes a comment block with metadata. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged after the "execution" of this code snippet.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
