You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, a large integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and prints the maximum number of elements in the list `a` that can be reduced to zero by performing operations where pairs of elements are decreased by the same amount, up to a total decrease of `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when the Kraken's attacks are such that they can completely sink ships in a single attack or when the number of attacks is very large.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 20
2 7 1 8 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- The Kraken attacks as follows:
  1. Attacks the first ship (durability becomes 1), `a = [1, 7, 1, 8, 2]`
  2. Attacks the last ship (durability becomes 1), `a = [1, 7, 1, 8, 1]`
  3. Attacks the first ship (durability becomes 0), `a = [0, 7, 1, 8, 1]` (ship 1 sinks)
  4. Attacks the last ship (durability becomes 0), `a = [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]` (ship 5 sinks)
  5. Attacks the second ship (durability becomes 6), `a = [0, 6, 1, 8, 0]`
  6. Attacks the fourth ship (durability becomes 7), `a = [0, 6, 1, 7, 0]`
  7. Attacks the second ship (durability becomes 5), `a = [0, 5, 1, 7, 0]`
  8. Attacks the fourth ship (durability becomes 6), `a = [0, 5, 1, 6, 0]`
  9. Attacks the second ship (durability becomes 4), `a = [0, 4, 1, 6, 0]`
  10. Attacks the fourth ship (durability becomes 5), `a = [0, 4, 1, 5, 0]`
  11. Attacks the second ship (durability becomes 3), `a = [0, 3, 1, 5, 0]`
  12. Attacks the fourth ship (durability becomes 4), `a = [0, 3, 1, 4, 0]`
  13. Attacks the second ship (durability becomes 2), `a = [0, 2, 1, 4, 0]`
  14. Attacks the fourth ship (durability becomes 3), `a = [0, 2, 1, 3, 0]`
  15. Attacks the second ship (durability becomes 1), `a = [0, 1, 1, 3, 0]`
  16. Attacks the fourth ship (durability becomes 2), `a = [0, 1, 1, 2, 0]`
  17. Attacks the second ship (durability becomes 0), `a = [0, 0, 1, 2, 0]` (ship 2 sinks)
  18. Attacks the fourth ship (durability becomes 1), `a = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]`
  19. Attacks the third ship (durability becomes 0), `a = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]` (ship 3 sinks)
  20. Attacks the fourth ship (durability becomes 0), `a = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (ship 4 sinks)

In this case, all 5 ships should sink, but the program might not correctly handle this scenario due to the logic in the `while` loop and the calculation of `mi`.

### Specific Issue in the Code:
The logic in the `while` loop and the calculation of `mi` can cause the program to incorrectly handle cases where the Kraken's attacks can completely sink ships in a single attack or when there are many attacks left after sinking some ships. The program might break out of the loop prematurely or incorrectly calculate the number of ships sunk.

### Suggested Fix:
The program needs to ensure that it correctly handles cases where the Kraken's attacks can completely sink ships in a single attack and that it continues to attack the remaining ships until either all ships are sunk or the Kraken runs out of attacks. The logic for updating `l`, `r`, and `ans` needs to be more robust to handle these edge cases.
