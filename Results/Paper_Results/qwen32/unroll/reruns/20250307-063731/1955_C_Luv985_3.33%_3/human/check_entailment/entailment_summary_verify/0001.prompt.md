You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, a large integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and prints the maximum number of elements in the list `a` that can be reduced to zero by performing operations where pairs of elements are decreased by the same amount, up to a total decrease of `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` ships, each with a durability value.
- The Kraken attacks the ships in a specific order: first, last, first, last, and so on.
- Each attack reduces the durability of the attacked ship by 1.
- A ship sinks if its durability drops to 0.
- We need to determine how many ships are sunk after `k` attacks.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads `T` (number of test cases).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
   - It then reads the durability values of the ships into a list `a`.

2. **Logic for Simulating Attacks:**
   - Two pointers `l` and `r` are initialized to the start and end of the list `a`, respectively.
   - The variable `ans` keeps track of the number of ships sunk.
   - The loop `while l < r and k > 0` continues as long as there are ships left to attack and attacks remaining.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `mi` is the minimum durability between the ships at positions `l` and `r`.
     - If `mi * 2 <= k`, it means both ships can be attacked `mi` times each:
       - Their durability is reduced by `mi`.
       - `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`.
       - If the durability of a ship becomes 0, it is sunk (`ans` is incremented), and the pointer is moved to the next ship.
     - If `mi * 2 > k`, it means the Kraken does not have enough attacks to completely sink both ships:
       - The Kraken attacks the first ship `k // 2` times and the last ship `k // 2` times, plus one more time on the first ship if `k` is odd (`t = k % 2`).
       - The program then checks if the first ship's durability becomes 0 and increments `ans` if it does.
       - The loop breaks as there are no more attacks left.
   - After the loop, if `l == r`, it means there is one ship left. If `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of this ship, it is sunk (`ans` is incremented).

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the number of ships sunk.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the alternating attack pattern of the Kraken.
- It efficiently reduces the durability of the ships and counts the number of ships sunk.
- The edge cases, such as when there is only one ship left or when the number of attacks is exactly enough to sink a ship, are handled correctly.
- The logic for breaking out of the loop when there are not enough attacks to sink both ships is sound.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
