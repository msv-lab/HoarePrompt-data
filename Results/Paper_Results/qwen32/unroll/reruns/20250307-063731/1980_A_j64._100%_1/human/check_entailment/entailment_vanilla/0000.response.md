Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems) and `m` (number of rounds).
3. It then reads a string `a` representing the difficulty levels of the problems.
4. The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the number of additional problems needed.
5. Inside `func_1`, it initializes a list `count` of size 7 (for difficulties 'A' to 'G') with all elements set to 0.
6. It iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the difficulty level of each problem.
7. It then calculates the number of additional problems needed by iterating through the `count` list. If the count of any difficulty level is less than `m`, it adds the difference to `needed_problems`.
8. Finally, it returns the total number of additional problems needed.

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
