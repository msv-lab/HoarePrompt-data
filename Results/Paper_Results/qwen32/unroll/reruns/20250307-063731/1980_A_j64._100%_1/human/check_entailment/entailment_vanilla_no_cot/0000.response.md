Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the calculation of the minimum number of problems needed. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that Vlad needs one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') for each round, not just a total of `m` problems for each difficulty level.

Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
    return needed_problems
```

This function is actually correct in terms of counting the number of problems needed per difficulty level to satisfy the requirement of `m` rounds. However, the problem statement requires that for each of the `m` rounds, there must be one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). Therefore, the correct approach should be:

1. Count the occurrences of each difficulty level.
2. For each difficulty level, determine how many more problems are needed to meet the requirement of `m` problems for that level.
3. Sum these values to get the total number of additional problems needed.

The provided function does exactly this, so the original program should indeed be correct based on the logic implemented. However, the initial response assumed there might be a logical error, leading to the conclusion of `False`. Given the correct implementation, the response should be:

Correctness: **True**
