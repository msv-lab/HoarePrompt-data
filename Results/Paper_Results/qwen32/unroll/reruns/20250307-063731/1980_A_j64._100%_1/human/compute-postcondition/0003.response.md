Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each test case `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `count` is a list of 7 integers where each element at index i represents the number of occurrences of the character chr(i + ord('A')) in the string `a`; `needed_problems` is 0.**

Natural Language: The value of `needed_problems` has been initialized to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
