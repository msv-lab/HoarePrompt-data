The value of `ci1` is assigned the value of `ci2 - 1`. Given that `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2` and the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci1` will be `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path_ba` contains the shortest path from `b` to `a` in reverse order, with the first element being `b` and the last element being `a`; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is even; `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ci1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`.**
