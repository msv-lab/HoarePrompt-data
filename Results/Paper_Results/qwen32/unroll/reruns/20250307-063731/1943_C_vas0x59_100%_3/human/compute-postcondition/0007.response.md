The code snippet assigns the return value of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. Since `a` is already assigned the return value of `func_1(d)`, `b` will have the same value as `a`. The values of `u2vs`, `d`, and `previous` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex in the tree; `d` is the list returned by `bfs(a)` containing the shortest distances from vertex `a` to each of the `n` vertices in the tree; `a` is the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list returned by `bfs(a)` containing the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `a` to each of the `n` vertices in the tree; `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)` which is the same as `a`.**
