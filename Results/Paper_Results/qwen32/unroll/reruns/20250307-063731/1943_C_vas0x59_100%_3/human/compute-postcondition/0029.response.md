Functionality: **The function reads input to construct a tree represented by adjacency lists, finds the longest path in the tree, and then determines a specific set of operations based on the length of this path. If the path length is even, it generates a list of operations involving pairs of vertices from the middle of the path. The function prints the number of operations and their details, and returns None.**
