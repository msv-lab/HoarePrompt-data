Postcondition: **`path_ba` contains the shortest path from `b` to `a` in reverse order, with the first element being `b` and the last element being `a`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` remains an empty list. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list of tuples `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3), ...]`, where `c1` and `c2` are the middle two elements of `path_ba`. Specifically, `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, `ci1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[len(path_ba) // 2 - 1]`, and `c2` is `path_ba[len(path_ba) // 2]`.**
