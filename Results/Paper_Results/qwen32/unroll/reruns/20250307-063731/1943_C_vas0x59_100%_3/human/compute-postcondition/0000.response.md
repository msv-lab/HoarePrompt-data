The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `u2vs` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the neighbors of a vertex in a tree.

Since the code changes the value of `n` to whatever integer is input by the user, we need to reflect this change in the output state. The value of `u2vs` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the neighbors of a vertex in a tree, `n` is the integer input by the user representing the number of vertices in the tree.**
