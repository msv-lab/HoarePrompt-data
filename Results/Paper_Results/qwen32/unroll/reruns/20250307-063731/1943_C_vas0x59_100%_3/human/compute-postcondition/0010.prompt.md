Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex in the tree; `d` is the list returned by `bfs(a)` containing the shortest distances from vertex `a` to each of the `n` vertices in the tree; `a` is the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list returned by `bfs(a)` containing the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `a` to each of the `n` vertices in the tree; `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)` which is the same as `a`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
