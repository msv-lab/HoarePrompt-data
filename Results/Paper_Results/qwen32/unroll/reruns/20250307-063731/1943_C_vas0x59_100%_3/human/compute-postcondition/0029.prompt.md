You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: u2vs is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the neighbors of a vertex in a tree, n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and the relationship is that each vertex has a corresponding list of its connected vertices in u2vs.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex in the tree. Each vertex index is 0-based.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: `path_ba` contains the shortest path from `b` to `a` in reverse order, with the first element being `b` and the last element being `a`.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: - `path_ba` remains unchanged.
        #- `ops` will contain `ci + 1` tuples, each of the form `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from `0` to `ci`.
        #- `ci` remains unchanged.
        #- `c` remains unchanged.
        #
        #Output State:
    else :
        ci2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        ci1 = ci2 - 1
        c1 = path_ba[ci1]
        c2 = path_ba[ci2]
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: path_ba contains the shortest path from b to a in reverse order, with the first element being b and the last element being a; ops is a list of tuples [(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3), ...], where c1 and c2 are the middle two elements of path_ba; ci2 is len(path_ba) // 2; ci1 is len(path_ba) // 2 - 1; c1 is path_ba[len(path_ba) // 2 - 1]; c2 is path_ba[len(path_ba) // 2].
    #State: `path_ba` contains the shortest path from `b` to `a` in reverse order, with the first element being `b` and the last element being `a`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` remains an empty list. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list of tuples `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3), ...]`, where `c1` and `c2` are the middle two elements of `path_ba`. Specifically, `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, `ci1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[len(path_ba) // 2 - 1]`, and `c2` is `path_ba[len(path_ba) // 2]`.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: 0 if the length of `path_ba` is odd, otherwise a positive integer (where the positive integer is the number of tuples in `ops` based on the pattern described)
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: (empty string if the length of `path_ba` is odd, or a series of formatted strings '{c1+1} 1', '{c2+1} 1', '{c1+1} 3', '{c2+1} 3', ... if the length of `path_ba` is even)
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `u2vs`, which is a list of lists containing integers representing the neighbors of each vertex in a tree, and `n`, which is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree. The function returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
