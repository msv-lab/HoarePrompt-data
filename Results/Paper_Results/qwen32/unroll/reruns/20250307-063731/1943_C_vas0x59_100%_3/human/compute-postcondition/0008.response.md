The code snippet `path_ba = [b]` initializes a new list `path_ba` with the single element `b`. This does not affect any of the other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`), but it does create a new list variable `path_ba`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex in the tree; `d` is the list returned by `bfs(a)` containing the shortest distances from vertex `a` to each of the `n` vertices in the tree; `a` is the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list returned by `bfs(a)` containing the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `a` to each of the `n` vertices in the tree; `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)` which is the same as `a`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.**
