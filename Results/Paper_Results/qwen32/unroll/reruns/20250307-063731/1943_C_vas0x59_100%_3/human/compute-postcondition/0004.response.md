Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex in the tree; `d` is a list containing the shortest distances from vertex 0 to each of the `n` vertices in the tree.**

In simpler terms, `u2vs` remains unchanged as it is the adjacency list of the tree. The variable `d` is now a list where each element `d[i]` represents the shortest distance from vertex 0 to vertex `i` in the tree.
