Let's analyze the given loop and the context provided.

The loop iterates while the last element in the list `path_ba` does not have a previous vertex of `-1`. The variable `previous` is a list where each index corresponds to a vertex in the tree, and the value at each index is the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to that vertex. If the value is `-1`, it indicates that there is no previous vertex, meaning we have reached the starting vertex `a`.

Given that `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)` and is appended to `path_ba` initially, the loop will continue to trace back through the `previous` list until it reaches the vertex `a`, which has a `previous` value of `-1`.

Therefore, after the loop finishes, `path_ba` will contain the shortest path from `b` to `a` in reverse order.

Output State: **`path_ba` contains the shortest path from `b` to `a` in reverse order, with the first element being `b` and the last element being `a`.**

In natural language: The final state is that `path_ba` will be a list representing the shortest path from vertex `b` to vertex `a`, but listed in reverse order, starting with `b` and ending with `a`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the problem statement.
