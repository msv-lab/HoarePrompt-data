Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `path_ba` contains the shortest path from `b` to `a` in reverse order.
2. The first element of `path_ba` is `b`, and the last element is `a`.
3. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` remains an empty list.
4. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list of tuples `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3), ...]`, where:
   - `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`
   - `ci1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1`
   - `c1` is `path_ba[len(path_ba) // 2 - 1]`
   - `c2` is `path_ba[len(path_ba) // 2]`

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len(ops))
```

### Analysis:
- The length of `path_ba` determines whether `ops` is an empty list or a list of tuples.
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is an empty list, so `len(ops)` is `0`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is constructed based on the middle two elements of `path_ba`. However, the exact number of tuples in `ops` is not specified in the problem statement, but we know the pattern and that it will be a non-empty list.

### Conclusion:
- Since the length of `ops` is either `0` (if `path_ba` is odd) or a positive integer (if `path_ba` is even), the output will be `0` or a positive integer based on the length of `path_ba`.

Given the precondition and the code, we can't determine the exact number of elements in `ops` if `path_ba` is even, but we can describe the possible outcomes.

### Final Output:
Output: **0 if the length of `path_ba` is odd, otherwise the number of tuples in `ops` (which is a positive integer based on the pattern described)**

However, since we need a precise description and the problem asks for the most precise description possible, we will describe the two possible outcomes clearly:

Output: **0 if the length of `path_ba` is odd, otherwise a positive integer (where the positive integer is the number of tuples in `ops` based on the pattern described)**
