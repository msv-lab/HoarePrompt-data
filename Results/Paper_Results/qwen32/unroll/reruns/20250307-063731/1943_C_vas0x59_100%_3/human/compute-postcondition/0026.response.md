To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and understand how the variables `path_ba` and `ops` are defined.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` to `a` in reverse order, with the first element being `b` and the last element being `a`.
2. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` remains an empty list.
3. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list of tuples `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3), ...]`, where:
   - `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2` (middle index)
   - `ci1` is `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1` (index before middle)
   - `c1` is `path_ba[len(path_ba) // 2 - 1]`
   - `c2` is `path_ba[len(path_ba) // 2]`

### Analysis:
- The `ops` list is constructed based on whether the length of `path_ba` is even or odd.
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is an empty list, and the print statement will not print anything.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` will contain tuples of the form `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, etc., where `c1` and `c2` are the middle two elements of `path_ba`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement uses the `map` function to format each tuple in `ops` as a string in the form `'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'` and then prints these strings, each on a new line.

### Output Based on Conditions:
- If `ops` is empty (length of `path_ba` is odd), the output will be an empty string.
- If `ops` is not empty (length of `path_ba` is even), the output will be a series of lines, each containing the formatted string for each tuple in `ops`.

### Final Formatted Output:
Given the conditions:
- If `path_ba` has an odd length, `ops` is empty, and the output will be empty.
- If `path_ba` has an even length, `ops` will be constructed as described, and the output will be a series of formatted strings.

Since the exact `path_ba` list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `c1` and `c2`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the formatted strings for each tuple in `ops`.

### Conclusion:
Output: **(empty string if the length of `path_ba` is odd, or a series of formatted strings '{c1+1} 1', '{c2+1} 1', '{c1+1} 3', '{c2+1} 3', ... if the length of `path_ba` is even)**
