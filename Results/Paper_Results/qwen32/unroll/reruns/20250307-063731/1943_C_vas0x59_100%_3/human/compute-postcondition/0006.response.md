Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices of the vertices that are directly connected to the corresponding vertex in the tree; `d` is the list returned by `bfs(a)` containing the shortest distances from vertex `a` to each of the `n` vertices in the tree; `a` is the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list returned by `bfs(a)` containing the previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `a` to each of the `n` vertices in the tree.**

In this output state, the variables `d` and `previous` have been updated to reflect the results of the `bfs(a)` function call. The variable `a` remains the return value of `func_1(d)`, and `u2vs` remains unchanged.
