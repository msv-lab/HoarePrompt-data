The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates a new list `a` of length `n` such that each element `a[i]` (for i > 0) is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list. The first element of `a` is initialized to 1000. The function then prints the list `a` for each test case.
