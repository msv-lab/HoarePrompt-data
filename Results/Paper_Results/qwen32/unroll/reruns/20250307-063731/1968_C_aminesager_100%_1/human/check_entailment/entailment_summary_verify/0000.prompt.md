You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates a new list `a` of length `n` such that each element `a[i]` (for i > 0) is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list. The first element of `a` is initialized to 1000. The function then prints the list `a` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the array `a` such that `a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. 

The program initializes `a` with `[1000]` and then for each `i` from `1` to `n-1`, it appends `a[i-1] + T[i-1]` to `a`. This approach does not guarantee that `a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i`.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
The output should be an array `a` such that:
- `a_2 % a_1 = 1`
- `a_3 % a_2 = 1`

A valid output could be `2 3 4` or `5 6 7` or any other array satisfying the conditions.

**Program's Output:**
```
1000 1001 1002
```

**Explanation of Why the Program's Output is Incorrect:**
- `1001 % 1000 = 1` (which is correct for `x_2 = 1`)
- `1002 % 1001 = 1` (which is correct for `x_3 = 1`)

While the program's output happens to be correct for this specific input, it is not guaranteed to be correct for all inputs. For example, consider the following input:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
The output should be an array `a` such that:
- `a_2 % a_1 = 2`
- `a_3 % a_2 = 3`

A valid output could be `5 7 10` because:
- `7 % 5 = 2`
- `10 % 7 = 3`

**Program's Output:**
```
1000 1002 1005
```

**Explanation of Why the Program's Output is Incorrect:**
- `1002 % 1000 = 2` (which is correct for `x_2 = 2`)
- `1005 % 1002 = 3` (which is correct for `x_3 = 3`)

However, the program's approach does not guarantee this for all inputs. A more robust solution would be to initialize `a_1` to a value greater than the maximum possible `x_i` and then set `a_i` to `a_{i-1} + x_i` for `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [501]  # a_1 can be any value greater than max(T)
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)
```

This ensures that `a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n` by initializing `a_1` to a value greater than the maximum possible `x_i` and then constructing the rest of the array accordingly.
