You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates a new list `a` of length `n` such that each element `a[i]` (for i > 0) is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list. The first element of `a` is initialized to 1000. The function then prints the list `a` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem by generating an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for each test case. Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` in the array `a` and the `n-1` elements of the array `x`.
3. The program initializes the array `a` with the first element as `1000`.
4. For each subsequent element in `a` (from index 1 to `n-1`), it calculates the value as `a[i] = a[i-1] + T[i-1]`, where `T` is the input array `x`.
5. Finally, it prints the array `a` for the current test case.

Let's verify if this approach satisfies the conditions of the problem:

- The first element of `a` is set to `1000`, which is within the range `[1, 10^9]`.
- For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where `2 <= i <= n`), the value is calculated as `a[i] = a[i-1] + T[i-1]`. This ensures that `a[i]` is always greater than `a[i-1]` and thus `a[i] % a[i-1]` will be `T[i-1]` (which is `x[i]`), as required by the problem.
- Since `a[i]` is always greater than `a[i-1]`, the modulo operation `a[i] % a[i-1]` will always yield `T[i-1]`, satisfying the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`.

However, there is a potential issue with the initial value of `a[0]`. The problem specifies that `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `1 <= i <= n`. While `1000` is within this range, the program does not guarantee that the subsequent values of `a` will not exceed `10^9`. Specifically, if the values in `T` are large enough, the values in `a` can grow beyond `10^9`, which would violate the problem constraints.

To ensure that all values of `a` remain within the range `[1, 10^9]`, we can modify the initial value of `a[0]` to be `1` and adjust the subsequent values accordingly. However, the given program does not account for this, and thus, it may produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Given the above analysis, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible inputs within the problem constraints.
