### Reasoning:

The given problem requires finding the minimum number of burles (cost) to make all elements of the array equal with at most one operation. The operation involves selecting a subarray and changing all its elements to a specific value, with the cost being the length of the subarray.

The annotated program's `func_1` function attempts to solve this problem by identifying segments of the array that are already equal and calculating the cost based on the first and last segments that are different.

However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. **Handling of Uniform Arrays**:
   - If the entire array is the same, `func_1` correctly returns `0` since no operation is needed. This is handled by the condition `if (arr[0] == arr[-1])`.

2. **Handling of Non-Uniform Arrays**:
   - If the array is not uniform, the function calculates the cost based on the indices `i` and `j`. However, the logic `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)` does not correctly compute the minimum cost to make the array uniform with one operation.
   - The idea should be to find the minimum cost of operations that could make the entire array uniform, which involves considering different possible subarrays to change. The current logic does not consider all possible subarrays but only specific segments.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the cost of making the entire array uniform by changing the minimum length of subarrays that can be changed to a single value.
   - A correct approach involves checking the cost of changing the array to the most frequent element or considering the cost of changing the array to any other value efficiently.

Given the above points, the current implementation does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all test cases, especially for non-uniform arrays.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is **incorrect** due to the flawed logic in the `func_1` function, which does not correctly compute the minimum cost for making the array uniform with one operation.

**Correctness: False**
