### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the longest contiguous segment of the array that can be ignored (i.e., the segment from the beginning to the first change and from the end to the last change). However, the logic used in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not correctly determine the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal.

Let's break down the issues in the provided program:

1. **Identifying the Segments:**
   - The program correctly identifies the first and last segments that are uniform (i.e., all elements are the same). 
   - `i` is the index of the first element that is different from the element immediately following it.
   - `j` is the index of the last element that is different from the element immediately preceding it.

2. **Calculating the Minimum Burles:**
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same (`arr[0] == arr[-1]`), the program returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`. This logic seems incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of making the entire array equal to the value of the first/last element by applying the operation in a different way.
   - If the first and last elements are different, the program returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`. This logic is also incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of making the array uniform by choosing a different segment to change.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the following:
- We can make the entire array equal to any value `x` by applying the operation once.
- The cost of the operation is the length of the segment we choose to change.
- The optimal strategy is to choose the segment that minimizes the cost. This can be done by considering the longest uniform segment and changing the rest of the array to match the value of the uniform segment.

### Correctness Evaluation:
Given the flaws in the logic used in the provided program, it is clear that the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
