Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation of assigning a value to a subarray. However, the current implementation does not consider all possible ways to make the array uniform with the minimum cost.

The current implementation only checks if the first and last elements are the same and then tries to find the longest subarray of equal elements at the start and end. This is not sufficient to find the optimal solution for all cases.

For example, consider the test case `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The program will return `4`, but the correct answer is `3` by setting `i=2`, `j=4`, and `x=1`, changing the array to `[1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1]` and then setting `i=4`, `j=5`, and `x=1` to get `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with a total cost of `3`.

To solve the problem correctly, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as considering all possible values to set the entire array to and calculating the cost for each, or using dynamic programming to find the optimal subarray to change.
