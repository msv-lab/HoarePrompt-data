Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), and n is the length of the list `arr`. The function returns the maximum value between `j - i - 1` and 0, where `i` and `j` are indices in the list. If none of the conditions for Case_1 are met, it returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j.**
