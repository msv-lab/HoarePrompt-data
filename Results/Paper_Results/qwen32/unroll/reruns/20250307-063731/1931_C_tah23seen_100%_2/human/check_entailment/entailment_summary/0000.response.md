### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its intended solution step-by-step:

#### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find the minimum cost (in burles) to make all elements in an array equal by performing at most one operation. The operation allows us to select a contiguous subarray and set all its elements to a chosen value. The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes an array `arr` and calculates the minimum cost required to make all elements in the array equal by performing at most one operation. The function seems to be trying to identify the longest subarray that can be changed to make the entire array equal.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the function:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `i` and `j` are initialized to the start and end of the array, respectively.

2. **Finding the First Segment:**
   - The first `while` loop increments `i` to find the first index where the array element changes from the first element. This identifies the longest initial segment of identical elements starting from the beginning.

3. **Finding the Last Segment:**
   - The second `while` loop decrements `j` to find the first index from the end where the array element changes from the last element. This identifies the longest final segment of identical elements ending at the end.

4. **Comparison of First and Last Elements:**
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same (`arr[0] == arr[-1]`), the function calculates the cost as the length of the middle segment that can be changed (i.e., `j - i - 1`).
   - If the first and last elements are different, the function calculates the cost as the length of the longest segment that can be changed either from the start or the end (i.e., `min(n - i - 1, j)`).

5. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns the maximum of the calculated cost and 0 to ensure the cost is non-negative.

#### Execution Summary Analysis:
The execution summary suggests that the function calculates the length of the longest segment that can be changed to make the entire array equal. However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic to determine the minimum cost is flawed. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The function would return `4`, but the correct answer is `4` (changing the middle four elements to `1` or `5`). However, the function's logic does not account for the optimal choice of the subarray to change.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum cost to make all elements in the array equal. Thus, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
