You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: Let's analyze the given program and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description. The program is supposed to determine the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation of assigning a value to a contiguous subarray.

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by finding the longest prefix and suffix of the array that consists of the same elements and then calculating the minimum cost to make the rest of the array equal to either the prefix or suffix element. However, this approach does not cover all possible cases, especially when the optimal solution involves assigning a value to a subarray that is neither the prefix nor the suffix.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To make all elements equal, we can choose to set the subarray from index 2 to 4 (1-based indexing) to 2. This operation will cost 3 - 2 + 1 = 2 burles, resulting in the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]. Then, we can choose to set the subarray from index 1 to 1 and index 5 to 5 to 2, each costing 1 burle, resulting in the array [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]. However, we are only allowed one operation, so the optimal solution is to set the subarray from index 2 to 4 to 2, which costs 2 burles.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will output `2` for this input, which seems correct at first glance. However, let's consider another case to ensure the program's correctness.

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 3 3 3 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To make all elements equal, we can choose to set the subarray from index 2 to 4 (1-based indexing) to 3. This operation will cost 4 - 2 + 1 = 3 burles, resulting in the array [1, 3, 3, 3, 1]. Then, we can choose to set the subarray from index 1 to 1 and index 5 to 5 to 3, each costing 1 burle, resulting in the array [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]. However, we are only allowed one operation, so the optimal solution is to set the subarray from index 2 to 4 to 3, which costs 3 burles. But we can also set the subarray from index 1 to 5 to 3, which costs 5 - 1 + 1 = 5 burles, but setting the subarray from index 2 to 4 to 3 is the optimal solution. However, the program might not handle this case correctly if it only considers the longest prefix and suffix.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will output `2` for this input, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `3`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all cases correctly, and the Correctness is **False**.
