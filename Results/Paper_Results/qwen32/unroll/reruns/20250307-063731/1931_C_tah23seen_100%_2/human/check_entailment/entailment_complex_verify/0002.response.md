### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the logic implemented in `func_1(arr)` and compare it against the problem requirements and provided examples.

#### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Operation Description**: You can select a contiguous subarray and change all its elements to a single value `x`. The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray.
2. **Objective**: Find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.

#### Analysis of `func_1(arr)`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` is set to the start of the array.
   - `j` is set to the end of the array.

2. **Finding Segments**:
   - The first `while` loop increments `i` until it finds the first element that is not equal to the next element.
   - The second `while` loop decrements `j` until it finds the last element that is not equal to the previous element.

3. **Decision Making**:
   - If `arr[0] == arr[-1]`, the array can be made uniform by changing the middle segment (if any) to either `arr[0]` or `arr[-1]`. The cost is the length of this middle segment, which is `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
   - If `arr[0] != arr[-1]`, the cost is the minimum of changing the segment from the start to `j` or from `i` to the end. This is calculated as `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

#### Evaluation Against Provided Examples:
- **Example 1**: `6\n1 2 3 4 5 1`
  - `i` stops at `0` (since `arr[0] != arr[1]`).
  - `j` stops at `5` (since `arr[5] != arr[4]`).
  - `arr[0] != arr[5]`, so the cost is `max(min(6 - 0 - 1, 5), 0) = max(min(5, 5), 0) = 5`.
  - However, the correct cost is `4` because the optimal operation is to change `[2, 3, 4, 5]` to `1`.
  - **Issue Identified**: The logic does not correctly handle cases where the optimal operation involves changing a segment that is not necessarily the longest.

- **Example 2**: `7\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - `i` stops at `6` (since all elements are the same).
  - `j` stops at `0` (since all elements are the same).
  - `arr[0] == arr[6]`, so the cost is `max(0 - 6 - 1, 0) = max(-7, 0) = 0`.
  - **Correct Output**: `0`.

- **Example 3**: `8\n8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8`
  - `i` stops at `2` (since `arr[2] != arr[3]`).
  - `j` stops at `4` (since `arr[4] != arr[5]`).
  - `arr[0] != arr[7]`, so the cost is `max(min(8 - 2 - 1, 4), 0) = max(min(5, 4), 0) = 4`.
  - However, the correct cost is `2` because the optimal operation is to change `[1, 2]` to `8`.
  - **Issue Identified**: The logic does not correctly handle cases where the optimal operation involves changing a shorter segment.

- **Example 4**: `2\n1 2`
  - `i` stops at `0` (since `arr[0] != arr[1]`).
  - `j` stops at `1` (since `arr[1] != arr[0]`).
  - `arr[0] != arr[1]`, so the cost is `max(min(2 - 0 - 1, 1), 0) = max(min(1, 1), 0) = 1`.
  - **Correct Output**: `1`.

- **Example 5**: `3\n1 2 3`
  - `i` stops at `0` (since `arr[0] != arr[1]`).
  - `j` stops at `2` (since `arr[2] != arr[1]`).
  - `arr[0] != arr[2]`, so the cost is `max(min(3 - 0 - 1, 2), 0) = max(min(2, 2), 0) = 2`.
  - **Correct Output**: `2`.

- **Example 6**: `7\n4 3 2 7 1 1 3`
  - `i` stops at `0` (since `arr[0] != arr[1]`).
  - `j` stops at `6` (since `arr[6] != arr[5]`).
  - `arr[0] != arr[6]`, so the cost is `max(min(7 - 0 - 1, 6), 0) = max(min(6, 6), 0) = 6`.
  - **Correct Output**: `6`.

- **Example 7**: `9\n9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3`
  - `i` stops at `1` (since `arr[1] != arr[2]`).
  - `j` stops at `7` (since `arr[7] != arr[6]`).
  - `arr[0] != arr[8]`, so the cost is `max(min(9 - 1 - 1, 7), 0) = max(min(7, 7), 0) = 7`.
  - **Correct Output**: `7`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when the optimal operation involves changing a segment that is not necessarily the longest. The logic in `func_1(arr)` is flawed and does not guarantee the minimum cost for all possible input arrays.

### Final: **False**
