The value of `n` is reassigned to the length of the list `arr`. Since `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and `n` was initially the length of the list `arr`, the value of `n` remains the same. The variable `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `i` is 0.**
