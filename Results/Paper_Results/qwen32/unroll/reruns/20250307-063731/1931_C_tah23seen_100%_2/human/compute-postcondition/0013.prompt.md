You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), and n is the length of the list arr. The function is called for each test case, and the total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the element immediately following it, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are the same; `j` is `n - 1`.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: `j` is the index of the last element in the array that is different from the element immediately preceding it, or 0 if all elements from `j` to the start of the array are the same.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns the maximum value between `j - i - 1` and 0.
    #State: `j` is the index of the last element in the array that is different from the element immediately preceding it, or 0 if all elements from `j` to the start of the array are the same. The first element of the array is not equal to the last element of the array.
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), and n is the length of the list `arr`. The function returns the maximum value between `j - i - 1` and 0, where `i` and `j` are indices in the list. If none of the conditions for Case_1 are met, it returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the maximum value between `j - i - 1` and 0.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
