Output State: **The program returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j.**

This means the program calculates the value as the maximum of 0 and the smaller value between (n - i - 1) and j. Here, `n` is presumably the length of the array, `i` is some index, `j` is the index of the last element in the array that is different from the element immediately preceding it, or 0 if all elements from `j` to the start of the array are the same. The result is guaranteed to be non-negative.
