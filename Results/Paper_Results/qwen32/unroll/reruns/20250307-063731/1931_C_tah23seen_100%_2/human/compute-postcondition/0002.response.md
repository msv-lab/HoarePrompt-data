The code assigns the variable `j` the value of `len(arr) - 1`. Given that `arr` is a list of integers with a length of `n`, `j` will be `n - 1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `i` is 0; `j` is `n - 1`.**
