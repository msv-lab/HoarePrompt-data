Let's analyze the given loop and determine the output state based on the provided initial state:

### Initial State:
- `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the element immediately following it, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are the same.
- `j` is `n - 1` (where `n` is the length of the array).

### Loop Code:
```python
while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
    j -= 1
```

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs as long as `j` is greater than 0 and the element at index `j` is equal to the element at index `j - 1`.
- In each iteration, `j` is decremented by 1.

### Output State:
- The loop will terminate when `j` becomes 0 or when `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[j - 1]`.
- Essentially, `j` will point to the last index in the array where the element is different from the element immediately preceding it, or it will be 0 if all elements from `j` to the start of the array are the same.

### Natural Language Explanation:
- After the loop, `j` will be the index of the last element in the array that is different from the element immediately preceding it.
- If all elements from `j` to the start of the array are the same, `j` will be 0.

### Output State in Required Format:
Output State: **`j` is the index of the last element in the array that is different from the element immediately preceding it, or 0 if all elements from `j` to the start of the array are the same.**
