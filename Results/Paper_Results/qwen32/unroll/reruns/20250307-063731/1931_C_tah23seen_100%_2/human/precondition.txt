arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the size of the array for a test case, followed by lists of integers representing the elements of the array for each test case. The first element of arr is the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, the first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) is the size of the array, and the next n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) are the elements of the array. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
