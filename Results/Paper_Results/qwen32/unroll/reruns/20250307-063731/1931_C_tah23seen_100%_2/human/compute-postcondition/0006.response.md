To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `j > 0` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.

1. **Condition `j > 0`**: This condition ensures that `j` is a valid index that is greater than 0, allowing us to compare `arr[j]` with `arr[j - 1]`.

2. **Condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`**: This condition ensures that the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` are equal, which is necessary for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the element immediately following it, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are the same.
- `j` is `n - 1`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to make sure that both conditions are satisfied simultaneously. Let's analyze the possible scenarios:

### Scenario 1: All elements in `arr` are the same
- If all elements in `arr` are the same, then `i` would be `len(arr) - 1`.
- If `j` is `n - 1` (which is the same as `len(arr) - 1` if `n` is the length of `arr`), the condition `j > 0` would be true as long as `arr` has more than one element.
- The condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` would also be true because all elements are the same.

### Scenario 2: Not all elements in `arr` are the same
- If not all elements are the same, `i` would be the index of the first element that differs from the next one.
- For the loop to execute, `j` needs to be set to an index where `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j > 0`.

Given the initial state, we need to ensure that `j` is set to an index where the elements are the same and `j > 0`. If `j` is initially set to `n - 1` and all elements are the same, no adjustment is needed. However, if not all elements are the same, we need to adjust `j` to point to an index where the elements are the same.

### Final Adjustment
To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust `j` to an index where `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j > 0`. If all elements are the same, no adjustment is needed. If not, we need to find such an index.

State: **`i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the element immediately following it, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are the same; `j` is an index where `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j > 0`**.

However, since we are only allowed to adjust `j` and `j` is initially `n - 1`, we can assume the simplest case where all elements are the same for the loop to execute at least once without further adjustments.

State: **`i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the element immediately following it, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are the same; `j` is `n - 1`**.
