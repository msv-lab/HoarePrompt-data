You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
1. We need to find the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific prefix and suffix maximums.
2. The prefix maximums are given by indices `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}`.
3. The suffix maximums are given by indices `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}`.
4. The output should be the number of valid permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Key Observations:
1. The first element of the permutation must be a prefix maximum and the last element must be a suffix maximum.
2. The last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum must be the same index, as they both represent the maximum element in the permutation.
3. The elements between the prefix maximums and the suffix maximums must be arranged such that they do not violate the prefix and suffix maximum conditions.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program first reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m1`, and `m2`, followed by the lists of prefix and suffix maximum indices.
3. It checks if the last prefix maximum index is the same as the first suffix maximum index. If not, it returns 0.
4. It checks if the first prefix maximum index is 1 and the first suffix maximum index is `n`. If not, it returns 0.
5. It checks if there are any conflicting indices between the second last prefix maximum and the second suffix maximum. If there is a conflict, it returns 0.
6. It calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial mathematics:
   - It uses `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` to calculate the number of ways to arrange the elements before the last prefix maximum.
   - It then iteratively calculates the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements between the prefix and suffix maximums.
7. Finally, it returns the calculated number of permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic based on the problem constraints and observations. It properly handles the edge cases and uses combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of valid permutations. The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the logic implemented.

Correctness: **True**
