To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Permutation Conditions**:
   - The first element of the permutation must be the smallest element (since it is both a prefix and suffix maximum).
   - The last element of the permutation must be the largest element (since it is a suffix maximum).
   - The last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum must be the same, as they must be the largest element in the permutation.
   - No other prefix maximum can be a suffix maximum except for the largest element.

2. **Counting Valid Permutations**:
   - Given the constraints, the program calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial mathematics.
   - It uses the combination formula to determine the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements between the identified prefix and suffix maximums.

### Program Analysis:
- **Initial Checks**:
  - The program correctly checks if the last prefix maximum (`L[-1]`) is the same as the first suffix maximum (`R[0]`).
  - It also checks if the first prefix maximum is 1 (the smallest element) and the first suffix maximum is `N` (the largest element).
  - It includes an additional check to ensure that if there are more than one prefix and suffix maximums, the second last prefix maximum (`L[-2]`) is not the same as the second suffix maximum (`R[1]`).

- **Combinatorial Calculation**:
  - The program calculates the number of valid permutations using combinations. Specifically, it calculates `math.comb(N-1, L[-1]-1)` which is the number of ways to choose positions for the elements between the first and last maximums.
  - It then iteratively calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements between identified prefix and suffix maximums.

### Correctness Verification:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and conditions specified in the problem statement.
- The combinatorial calculations are performed correctly using the combination formula, and the results are taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers.
- The program passes the given example cases, which suggests that it is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
