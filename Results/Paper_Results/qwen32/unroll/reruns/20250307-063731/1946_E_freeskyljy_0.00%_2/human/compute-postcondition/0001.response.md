The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and assigns this list to the variable `L`. The initial state of the variables `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p`, and `s` remains unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 · 10^5, `M1` and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N, the arrays `p` and `s` contain `M1` and `M2` integers respectively, representing the indices of prefix and suffix maximums in increasing order, with each index being an integer between 1 and N inclusive; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
