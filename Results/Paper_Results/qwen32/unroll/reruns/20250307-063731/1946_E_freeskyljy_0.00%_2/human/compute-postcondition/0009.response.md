Postcondition: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 · 10^5, `M1` and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N, with both `M1` and `M2` greater than 1. The arrays `p` and `s` contain `M1` and `M2` integers respectively, representing the indices of prefix and suffix maximums in increasing order, with each index being an integer between 1 and N inclusive. `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, specifically `L[-2] == R[1]`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is N.**
