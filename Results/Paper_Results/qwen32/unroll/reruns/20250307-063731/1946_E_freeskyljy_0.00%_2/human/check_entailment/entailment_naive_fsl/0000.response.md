Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not correctly account for the positions of prefix and suffix maximums in all possible permutations.

Let's analyze a potential edge case:

### Edge Case:

Consider the following input:
```
1
4 3 3
1 2 4
1 2 4
```

This input indicates a permutation of length 4 with 3 prefix maximums and 3 suffix maximums at positions 1, 2, and 4.

#### Analysis:

1. **Prefix Maximums:**
   - At position 1: The element must be the maximum so far.
   - At position 2: The element must be the maximum so far.
   - At position 4: The element must be the maximum so far.

2. **Suffix Maximums:**
   - At position 1: The element must be the maximum from this position to the end.
   - At position 2: The element must be the maximum from this position to the end.
   - At position 4: The element must be the maximum from this position to the end.

Given these constraints, the only possible permutation is `[4, 3, 1, 2]` or `[4, 3, 2, 1]`, but the code will not correctly compute the number of valid permutations for this scenario.

### Why the Code Fails:

- The code checks if the last prefix maximum index is equal to the first suffix maximum index (`L[-1] != R[0]`), which is correct.
- It checks if the first prefix maximum index is 1 and the first suffix maximum index is `N` (`L[0] != 1 or R[0] != N`), which is also correct.
- It checks if the second last prefix maximum index is equal to the second suffix maximum index (`M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1])`), which is a specific case that may not cover all scenarios.

However, the core logic for calculating the number of valid permutations does not correctly handle all possible configurations of prefix and suffix maximums. Specifically, the combinatorial calculations do not account for all valid permutations that satisfy the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly compute the number of valid permutations for all possible inputs as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
