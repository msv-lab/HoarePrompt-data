You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not correctly account for the positions of prefix and suffix maximums in all possible permutations.

Let's analyze a potential edge case:

### Edge Case:

Consider the following input:
```
1
4 3 3
1 2 4
1 2 4
```

This input indicates a permutation of length 4 with 3 prefix maximums and 3 suffix maximums at positions 1, 2, and 4.

#### Analysis:

1. **Prefix Maximums:**
   - At position 1: The element must be the maximum so far.
   - At position 2: The element must be the maximum so far.
   - At position 4: The element must be the maximum so far.

2. **Suffix Maximums:**
   - At position 1: The element must be the maximum from this position to the end.
   - At position 2: The element must be the maximum from this position to the end.
   - At position 4: The element must be the maximum from this position to the end.

Given these constraints, the only possible permutation is `[4, 3, 1, 2]` or `[4, 3, 2, 1]`, but the code will not correctly compute the number of valid permutations for this scenario.

### Why the Code Fails:

- The code checks if the last prefix maximum index is equal to the first suffix maximum index (`L[-1] != R[0]`), which is correct.
- It checks if the first prefix maximum index is 1 and the first suffix maximum index is `N` (`L[0] != 1 or R[0] != N`), which is also correct.
- It checks if the second last prefix maximum index is equal to the second suffix maximum index (`M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1])`), which is a specific case that may not cover all scenarios.

However, the core logic for calculating the number of valid permutations does not correctly handle all possible configurations of prefix and suffix maximums. Specifically, the combinatorial calculations do not account for all valid permutations that satisfy the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly compute the number of valid permutations for all possible inputs as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
