To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the loop condition `i < N`. The variables `i` and `N` are the only ones that can be adjusted according to the loop head.

Here's the state right before the `while` loop:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `i` is `N + 1`.

The loop condition is `i < N`. Given that `i` is currently `N + 1`, the condition `i < N` is not satisfied, and thus the loop will not execute.

To make the loop execute, we need to adjust the value of `i` such that `i < N`. The simplest way to do this is to set `i` to a value less than `N`. Since `N` is at least 1, setting `i` to 0 or 1 would satisfy the condition.

However, based on the context provided, it's more logical to set `i` to 1 because the first element of `L` is 1, and the loop seems to be iterating through indices starting from 1. Therefore, setting `i` to 1 would be consistent with the given conditions.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 · 10^5, `i` is 1, `M1` and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N, the arrays `p` and `s` contain `M1` and `M2` integers respectively, representing the indices of prefix and suffix maximums in increasing order, with each index being an integer between 1 and N inclusive; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input. Additionally, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is N. Either `M1` is 1, or `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`. If `M1` > 1, then `cur` is 1, `nums_left` is `-1`, and `ans` is the result of the multiplication and modulo operations performed during the loop. If `M1` is 1, then `cur` is 1. `nums_left` is `-1`. `M2` is greater than 1.**
