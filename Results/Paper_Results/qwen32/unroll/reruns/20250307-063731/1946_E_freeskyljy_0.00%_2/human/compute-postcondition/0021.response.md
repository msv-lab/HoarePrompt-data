Postcondition: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 · 10^5, `M1` and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N, the arrays `p` and `s` contain `M1` and `M2` integers respectively, representing the indices of prefix and suffix maximums in increasing order, with each index being an integer between 1 and N inclusive; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input. Additionally, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is N. Either `M1` is 1, or `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`. If `M1` > 1, then `i` is 1, `cur` is `M1 - 2 - k`, `nums_left` is `-1`, and `ans` is the result of the multiplication and modulo operations performed during the loop. If `M1` is 1, then `cur` remains `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `-1`. `M2` is greater than 1.**
