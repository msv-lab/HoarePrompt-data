The code snippet `i = L[-1] - 1` assigns the value of the last element of list `L` minus 1 to the variable `i`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `L[-1]` is the last element of list `L` and the first element of `L` is 1, `L[-1]` could be any integer between 1 and N inclusive. However, since `L[-1]` is used in the calculation of `i`, we can describe `i` as `L[-1] - 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 · 10^5, `M1` and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N, the arrays `p` and `s` contain `M1` and `M2` integers respectively, representing the indices of prefix and suffix maximums in increasing order, with each index being an integer between 1 and N inclusive; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input. Additionally, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is N. Either `M1` is 1, or `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`. `ans` is the value of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `N - 2`. `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.**
