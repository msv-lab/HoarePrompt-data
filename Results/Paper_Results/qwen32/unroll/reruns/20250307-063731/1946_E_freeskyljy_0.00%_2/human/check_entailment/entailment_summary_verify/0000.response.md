Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine the number of permutations of length `n` that satisfy given prefix and suffix maximum indices. The program checks certain conditions and then calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods.

### Function Summary Recap:
The function `func_1`:
1. Reads input values `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `R`.
2. Checks if the last prefix maximum index is equal to the first suffix maximum index.
3. Checks if the first prefix maximum index is 1 and the first suffix maximum index is `N`.
4. Checks if the second last prefix maximum index is equal to the second suffix maximum index if both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1.
5. If none of these conditions are met, it calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods.

### Edge Case Analysis:
Let's consider the edge case provided in the original assessment:
```
1
4 3 3
1 2 4
1 2 4
```
This input indicates a permutation of length 4 with prefix maximums at positions 1, 2, and 4, and suffix maximums at positions 1, 2, and 4.

#### Analysis:
- The only valid permutation that satisfies these conditions is `[4, 3, 1, 2]` or `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- However, the code does not correctly compute the number of valid permutations for this scenario.

### Why the Code Fails:
- The code checks the necessary conditions for the indices but does not account for all valid permutations correctly.
- The combinatorial calculation does not handle the specific constraints imposed by the prefix and suffix maximums.

### Detailed Evaluation:
Let's review the logic of the code:
1. **Checking Conditions:**
   - `L[-1] != R[0]`: Ensures the last prefix maximum is the first suffix maximum.
   - `L[0] != 1 or R[0] != N`: Ensures the first prefix maximum is 1 and the first suffix maximum is `N`.
   - `M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1])`: Ensures that the second last prefix maximum is not the second suffix maximum if both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1.

2. **Calculating Permutations:**
   - The code calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods (`math.comb` and multiplication with modulo operations).
   - However, the combinatorial logic does not account for all valid permutations that satisfy the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly compute the number of valid permutations for all possible inputs as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not handle all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement.
