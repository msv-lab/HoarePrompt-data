To determine the output state after the execution of the loop, we need to carefully analyze the loop's behavior based on the given initial state and the conditions inside the loop.

### Initial State Recap:
- `N`: An integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `M1` and `M2`: Integers representing the number of prefix and suffix maximums respectively.
- `p` and `s`: Arrays of integers representing the indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
- `L`: A list of integers starting with 1 and ending with the same value as the first element of `R`.
- `R`: A list of integers starting with `N` and ending with the same value as the last element of `L`.
- `ans`: Initially set to `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
- `cur`: Initially set to `M1 - 2`.
- `nums_left`: Initially set to `N - 2`.
- `i`: Initially set to `L[-1] - 1`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop runs while `i > 1`. Inside the loop:
- If `i == L[cur]`, it decrements `cur` by 1.
- Otherwise, it multiplies `ans` by `nums_left` and takes the result modulo `MOD`, then decrements `nums_left` by 1.
- Finally, it decrements `i` by 1.

### Output State Calculation:
The loop will continue until `i` reaches 2. During each iteration, `i` is decremented by 1. The variable `cur` will decrement each time `i` matches an element in `L`. The variable `nums_left` will decrement with each iteration unless `i` matches an element in `L`.

The final value of `ans` will be the result of the multiplication and modulo operations performed during the loop. The final values of `cur`, `nums_left`, and `i` will be determined by the number of matches between `i` and elements in `L`.

#### Final Values:
- `i` will be 1 after the loop finishes.
- `cur` will be decremented each time `i` matches an element in `L`, so it will be `M1 - 2 - k` where `k` is the number of matches.
- `nums_left` will be decremented each iteration except when `i` matches an element in `L`, so it will be `N - 2 - (L[-1] - 2 - k) = N - L[-1] + k`.

### Output State:
Given the initial and loop conditions, the final state of the variables is:

- `i` will be 1.
- `cur` will be `M1 - 2 - k`, where `k` is the number of matches between `i` and elements in `L`.
- `nums_left` will be `N - L[-1] + k`.
- `ans` will be the result of the multiplication and modulo operations performed during the loop.

Since the exact value of `k` depends on the specific values of `L` and `M1`, we can't provide a specific numerical value for `cur` and `nums_left` without those values. However, the structure of the final state is as described.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `cur` is `M1 - 2 - k`, `nums_left` is `N - L[-1] + k`, `ans` is the result of the multiplication and modulo operations performed during the loop.**
