The code snippet provided modifies the value of `nums_left` by assigning it the result of the expression `N - R[0] - 1`. Given that `R[0]` is `N` (as per the initial state), the new value of `nums_left` becomes `N - N - 1`, which simplifies to `-1`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 · 10^5, `M1` and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N, the arrays `p` and `s` contain `M1` and `M2` integers respectively, representing the indices of prefix and suffix maximums in increasing order, with each index being an integer between 1 and N inclusive; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input. Additionally, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is N. Either `M1` is 1, or `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`. If `M1` > 1, then `i` is 1, `cur` is `M1 - 2 - k`, `nums_left` is `-1`, and `ans` is the result of the multiplication and modulo operations performed during the loop. If `M1` is 1, then `cur` remains `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `-1`**.
