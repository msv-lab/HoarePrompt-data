Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 · 10^5, `M1` and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N. The arrays `p` and `s` contain `M1` and `M2` integers respectively, representing the indices of prefix and suffix maximums in increasing order, with each index being an integer between 1 and N inclusive. The sum of N across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. The initial state for the arrays `p` and `s` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the provided code snippet.
