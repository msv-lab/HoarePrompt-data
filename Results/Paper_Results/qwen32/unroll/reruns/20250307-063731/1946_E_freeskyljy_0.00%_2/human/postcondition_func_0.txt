The function `func_1` reads input values for `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `R`. It checks specific conditions involving the elements of `L` and `R` and returns 0 if any of these conditions are met. If none of the conditions are met, it calculates a value `ans` through a series of multiplication and modulo operations and returns this value.
