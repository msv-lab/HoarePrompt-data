Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases and logic for counting the number of suitable permutations. Here are some observations and issues:

1. **Intersection of Prefix and Suffix Maximums**:
   - The program checks if `L[-2] == R[1]` when both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1. This is an oversimplification and may not cover all cases where the prefix and suffix maximums overlap in a way that invalidates the permutation.

2. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The program uses `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` to calculate the number of ways to place numbers before the last prefix maximum. However, this does not account for all the constraints imposed by the prefix and suffix maximums.

3. **Handling of Remaining Positions**:
   - The program iteratively multiplies the number of ways to place the remaining numbers, but it does not correctly account for the constraints imposed by the indices of the prefix and suffix maximums.

4. **General Logic**:
   - The logic for counting permutations needs to ensure that the numbers placed in positions that are not prefix or suffix maximums do not invalidate the prefix or suffix maximum conditions.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the number of suitable permutations for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.
