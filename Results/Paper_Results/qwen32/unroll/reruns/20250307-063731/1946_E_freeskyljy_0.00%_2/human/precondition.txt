Each test case consists of three integers n, m_1, and m_2, where 1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The next line contains m_1 integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, and the following line contains m_2 integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
