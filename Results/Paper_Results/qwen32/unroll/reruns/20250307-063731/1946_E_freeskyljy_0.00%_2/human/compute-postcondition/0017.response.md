To determine how to modify the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement. The `while` loop is defined as follows:

```
while i > 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can see that the loop will execute if the variable `i` is greater than 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is indeed greater than 1 right before the loop starts.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `M1` and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N.
- The arrays `p` and `s` contain `M1` and `M2` integers respectively, representing the indices of prefix and suffix maximums in increasing order, with each index being an integer between 1 and N inclusive.
- `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input. Additionally, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is N.
- Either `M1` is 1, or `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`.
- `ans` is the value of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
- `cur` is `M1 - 2`.
- `nums_left` is `N - 2`.
- `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.

We need to ensure that `i` is greater than 1. Since `i` is defined as `L[-1] - 1`, we need to ensure that `L[-1] - 1 > 1`, which simplifies to `L[-1] > 2`.

Given that `L[-1]` is the last element of the list `L` and the first element of `R`, and knowing that the first element of `R` is `N`, we need to ensure that `N > 2` so that `L[-1] = N > 2`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `N` to ensure it is greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 < N ≤ 2 · 10^5, `M1` and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N, the arrays `p` and `s` contain `M1` and `M2` integers respectively, representing the indices of prefix and suffix maximums in increasing order, with each index being an integer between 1 and N inclusive; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input. Additionally, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is N. Either `M1` is 1, or `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`. `ans` is the value of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `N - 2`. `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.**
