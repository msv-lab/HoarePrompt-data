For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, m1 and m2 are integers such that 1 ≤ m1, m2 ≤ n. The arrays p and s contain m1 and m2 integers respectively, representing the indices of prefix and suffix maximums in increasing order, with each index being an integer between 1 and n inclusive. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
