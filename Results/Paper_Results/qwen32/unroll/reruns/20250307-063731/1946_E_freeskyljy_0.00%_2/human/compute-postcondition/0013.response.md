The given code snippet is `cur = M1 - 2`. This line of code assigns the value of `M1 - 2` to the variable `cur`. The initial state specifies that `M1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ M1 ≤ N. Since `cur` is being assigned a value based on `M1`, we need to consider the possible values `cur` can take based on the range of `M1`.

- If `M1` is 1, then `cur` will be `1 - 2 = -1`.
- If `M1` is any other integer up to `N`, `cur` will be `M1 - 2`, which will be a value from `-1` to `N - 2`.

All other variables (`N`, `M2`, `p`, `s`, `L`, `R`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 · 10^5, `M1` and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N, the arrays `p` and `s` contain `M1` and `M2` integers respectively, representing the indices of prefix and suffix maximums in increasing order, with each index being an integer between 1 and N inclusive; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input. Additionally, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is N. Either `M1` is 1, or `M2` is 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`. `ans` is the value of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. `cur` is `M1 - 2`.**
