Reasoning: The given program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. The program simply prints points along the first row of the \(n \times n\) grid, which will result in a very limited set of distinct Manhattan distances. Specifically, for each pair of points \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\), the Manhattan distance is \(|1-1| + |i-j| = |i-j|\), which means the possible distances are just the integers from 0 to \(n-1\). This does not take advantage of the entire grid and fails to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

To maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances, a better strategy would be to place points in a way that spreads them out across the grid, such as placing points on a diagonal or in a zigzag pattern. This would result in a wider variety of distances between points.

For example, for \(n=3\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```
This results in the distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), which has a size of 3. However, an optimal arrangement could be:
```
1 1
2 3
3 1
```
This results in the distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 5.

Correctness: **False**
