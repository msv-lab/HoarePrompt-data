Reasoning:  
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task is to select `n` points in an `n x n` grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points is maximized. The given program simply prints points along the first row of the grid (i.e., `(1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, n)`), which does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. For example, with `n=3`, the program outputs `(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)`, resulting in only two distinct Manhattan distances: 0 and 1. However, as shown in the example, a better arrangement would be `(2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1)`, which results in four distinct Manhattan distances: 0, 1, 2, and 3.

Therefore, the program does not correctly maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Correctness: **False**
