Output State: **The variable `t` will be 0 after the loop finishes executing all its iterations. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last test case's input integer. The loop will have printed a sequence of numbers for each test case, where for each number `i` from 1 to `n`, it prints "1 i" on a new line, followed by a blank line after each test case.**

In simpler terms, after all the test cases are processed, `t` will be zero because it is decremented until it reaches zero. The variable `n` will retain the value of the last test case's input. The loop will have output a series of "1 i" pairs for each number from 1 to `n` for every test case, with a blank line separating the outputs of different test cases.
