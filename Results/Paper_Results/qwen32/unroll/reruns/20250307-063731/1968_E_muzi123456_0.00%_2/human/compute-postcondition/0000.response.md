The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50. After the execution of the code, the value of `t` will be the integer provided by the user, and it will still satisfy the condition 1 <= t <= 50. The variable `n` and its constraints remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^3.**
