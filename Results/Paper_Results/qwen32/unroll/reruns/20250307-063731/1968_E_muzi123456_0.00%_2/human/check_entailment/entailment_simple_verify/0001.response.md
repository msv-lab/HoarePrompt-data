Reasoning:
The original assessment is correct. The given program outputs points all in the first row of the grid, which indeed limits the set of distinct Manhattan distances to {0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}. This results in a maximum of n distinct Manhattan distances, which is suboptimal for n > 2.

To maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances, points should be placed in a more strategic manner. For example, placing points at (1,1), (2,3), (3,1) for n=3 as shown in the problem example achieves a larger set of distinct distances {0, 1, 2, 3}.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program is printing points in the form of (1, i) for i from 1 to n, which aligns with the original assessment that this approach is suboptimal.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for n > 2.

Final: **False**
