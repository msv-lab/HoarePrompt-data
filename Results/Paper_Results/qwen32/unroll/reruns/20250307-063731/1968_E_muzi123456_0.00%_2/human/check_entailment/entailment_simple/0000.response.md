Reasoning: The given program is supposed to output n points for each test case, which maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. However, the provided program does not achieve this goal. Instead, it simply outputs points in the form (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,n) for each test case. This results in a very limited set of Manhattan distances, primarily just 0 (for the same point) and values from 1 to n-1 (for points at different columns but the same row).

The examples in the problem statement show more optimal arrangements that result in a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances. For instance, for n=3, the optimal arrangement provided results in the set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has 4 distinct values. The program's output for n=3 would only result in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), which has 3 distinct values and is suboptimal.

Thus, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
