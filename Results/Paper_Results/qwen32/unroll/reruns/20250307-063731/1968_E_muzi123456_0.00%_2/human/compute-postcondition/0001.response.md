Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the state provided:

The `while` loop is:
```python
while t:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The condition for the loop to execute is `t`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be a non-zero integer.

Given state:
- `t` is an integer provided by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.

Since `t` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 50 (inclusive), it will always be a non-zero integer. Therefore, the loop will certainly execute at least once with the provided state.

No adjustments are needed to the state of `t` because it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^3.**
