To determine the state that allows the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition `t > 0`. The variables `start` and `end` are not part of the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop will execute if `t > 0`.
2. **Adjust the variable `t`**: Since `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given that `start` and `end` are already in a state such that `start <= end`, they do not need to be modified. The only variable that needs adjustment is `t`.

**Example Answer**:
State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0**
