### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues in the provided program. Let's break it down:

1. **Incorrect Distance Calculation**: The program uses the Euclidean distance formula to calculate the distance between two points. This is not appropriate for a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The correct method is to use the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of two adjacent corners.

2. **Incorrect Area Calculation**: The program multiplies the square roots of the squared distances and takes the absolute value, which does not correctly compute the area of the square. Instead, it should simply square the side length to get the area.

The annotated version of the code confirms these issues. The annotations show that the program calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points and then takes the square root of their product, which is not the correct approach for finding the area of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

The original assessment also provides a corrected version of the program, which correctly calculates the side length by using the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of two adjacent corners and then squares the side length to get the area.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues in the provided program and correctly suggests the necessary corrections. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
