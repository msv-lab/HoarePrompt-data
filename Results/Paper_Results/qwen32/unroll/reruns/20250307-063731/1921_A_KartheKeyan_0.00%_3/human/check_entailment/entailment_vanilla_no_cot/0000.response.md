Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program attempts to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. However, there are issues with the logic used to determine the side length of the square.

The program sorts the coordinates and then calculates the squared distances between the first two points and the last two points. It then multiplies the square roots of these distances and takes the absolute value, which does not correctly compute the area of the square.

To correctly determine the area of the square, we should calculate the distance between two adjacent points (which will be the side length of the square) and then square that distance to get the area. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        # Calculate the squared distance between the first and second point
        side_length_squared = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
        # The area of the square is the side length squared
        area = side_length_squared
        print(area)
        n -= 1

func()
```

This version assumes that the points are such that the distance between the first and second point is a side of the square, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem constraints. However, a more robust solution would involve checking all possible pairs of points to ensure we are calculating the correct side length.
