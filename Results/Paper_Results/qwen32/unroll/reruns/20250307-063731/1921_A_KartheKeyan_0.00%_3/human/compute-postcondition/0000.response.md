The provided code snippet does not utilize the initial state information about the test cases and the coordinates of the corners of the square. Instead, it focuses on reading an integer `n`, and for each of the `n` iterations, it reads another integer `l`, calculates a value `s` based on `l`, prints `s`, and decrements `n`.

Here is the step-by-step evaluation:

1. `n` is assigned the value of an integer input.
2. A while loop runs `n` times.
3. Inside the loop, `l` is assigned the value of another integer input.
4. `s` is initialized to 0.
5. `s` is updated by adding `(l//4) + (l - (4*(l//4)))//2`.
6. The value of `s` is printed.
7. `n` is decremented by 1.

Since the loop runs `n` times and `n` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, `n` will eventually become 0, and the loop will terminate.

The initial state information about the test cases and the coordinates of the corners of the square is not used in the code, so it remains unchanged. The only variables that change are `n`, `l`, and `s` within the loop. However, since `n` is decremented to 0 and `l` and `s` are local to each iteration, their final states are not relevant outside the loop.

Given the code and the initial state, the final output state is:

Output State: **There are t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). For each test case, there are four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The value of `n` is 0.**
