Output State: **There are t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). For each test case, there are four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The value of `n` is an input integer.**

Natural Language: The value of `n` is now an input integer, while the information about the test cases and their coordinates remains unchanged.
