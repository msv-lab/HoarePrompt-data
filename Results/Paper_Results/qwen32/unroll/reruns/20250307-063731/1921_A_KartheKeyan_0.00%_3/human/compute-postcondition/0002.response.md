To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the variable `n` since it is the only variable mentioned in the loop condition. The loop will execute as long as `n` is truthy, which means `n` must be a non-zero integer.

Given that `n` is an input integer, we need to ensure that it is not zero. The problem statement does not provide any specific constraints on `n` other than it being an integer, but we know that for the loop to execute, `n` must be non-zero.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Identify the variable in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `n` is non-zero.
3. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `n` is not zero. Since `n` is an input integer, we can specify that `n` must be a non-zero integer.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:

State: **There are t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). For each test case, there are four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The value of `n` must be a non-zero integer.**
