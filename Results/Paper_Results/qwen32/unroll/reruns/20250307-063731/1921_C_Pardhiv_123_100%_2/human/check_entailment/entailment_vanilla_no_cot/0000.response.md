Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the problem's requirements. Specifically, it incorrectly assumes that for each message, Stepan can either turn off and then on the phone or continue using the phone without turning it off, and it always chooses the option that minimizes the energy consumption. This is not the correct approach because Stepan might need to turn off and on the phone at specific times to ensure he can send all messages without the battery dropping to 0 or below.

The correct approach involves a more detailed decision-making process where Stepan should consider the potential battery level after each action (sending a message or turning off and on the phone) and ensure that the battery level never drops to 0 or below. The provided solution does not account for this correctly and can incorrectly determine that Stepan can send all messages when he actually cannot.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        ls = list(map(int, input().split()))
        prev = 0
        for m in ls:
            cost_to_send = a * (m - prev)
            if f > cost_to_send:
                f -= cost_to_send
            elif f > b:
                f -= b
                f -= a * (m - prev)
            else:
                print('NO')
                break
            prev = m
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that Stepan can send all messages by properly managing the battery charge levels and considering the costs of both sending messages and turning the phone off and on.
