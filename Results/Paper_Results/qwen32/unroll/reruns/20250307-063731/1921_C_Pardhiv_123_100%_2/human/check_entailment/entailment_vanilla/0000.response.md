Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
Stepan needs to send messages at specific times. His phone starts with a certain charge and consumes charge over time. He can turn the phone on and off, which consumes additional charge. We need to determine if Stepan can send all messages without the phone's charge dropping to zero or below.

### Key Points:
1. **Initial Charge (f)**: The charge of the phone at time 0.
2. **Charge Consumption (a)**: Charge lost per unit of time the phone is on.
3. **Turn-On/Off Consumption (b)**: Charge lost when the phone is turned off and then on.
4. **Messages**: List of times when messages need to be sent.

### Strategy:
For each test case:
1. Start with the initial charge `f`.
2. For each message, calculate the time interval since the last message or the start (if it's the first message).
3. Determine the charge consumption during this interval:
   - If the phone is on, the consumption is `a * (time_interval)`.
   - If the phone is turned off and on, the consumption is `b`.
4. Choose the option that consumes the least charge.
5. Subtract the chosen consumption from the current charge.
6. If at any point the charge becomes zero or negative, it's impossible to send the message, and the answer is "NO".
7. If all messages are sent successfully, the answer is "YES".

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program follows the strategy described above. Here's a detailed breakdown:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It reads the list of message times `ls`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It initializes the charge `f`.
   - It iterates through each message time.
   - For each message, it calculates the time interval since the last message or the start.
   - It calculates the charge consumption for both options (keeping the phone on or turning it off and on).
   - It subtracts the minimum of these two values from the current charge.
3. **Checking Charge**:
   - After processing all messages, it checks if the charge is positive.
   - If the charge is positive, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the strategy to determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge. It efficiently handles the constraints and edge cases, such as the phone being turned off and on multiple times.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
