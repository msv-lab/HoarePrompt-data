You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        (n, f, a, b) = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        t -= 1



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and a list `m` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates whether a certain condition (based on the values of `f`, `a`, `b`, and the differences between consecutive elements in `m`) is met, and prints "YES" if the condition is satisfied or "NO" otherwise. The function does not return any value explicitly; it outputs the result of each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        (n, f, a, b) = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        t -= 1
```

### Problem Description Recap

- Stepan needs to send `n` messages at specific moments `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`.
- The phone starts with `f` units of charge.
- The phone consumes `a` units of charge per unit of time.
- Turning the phone off and on consumes `b` units of charge.
- The goal is to determine if Stepan can send all messages without the phone's charge dropping to zero or below.

### Logic in the Program

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It reads the list of message times `ls` and prepends `0` to it.
   - It iterates through each message time and calculates the charge consumption:
     - `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` represents the charge consumed if the phone stays on.
     - `b` represents the charge consumed if the phone is turned off and on.
     - It subtracts the minimum of these two values from the remaining charge `f`.
3. After processing all message times, it checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than zero. If yes, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if the program handles all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement.

1. **Initial Charge and Immediate Message:**
   - Example: `n=1`, `f=3`, `a=1`, `b=5`, `m_1=3`
     - The phone consumes `3 * 1 = 3` units of charge to send the message at `m_1=3`.
     - Remaining charge: `3 - 3 = 0`.
     - The program correctly prints "NO" because the charge drops to zero after sending the message.
   
2. **Charge Sufficiency with Turn Off/On:**
   - Example: `n=5`, `f=10`, `a=1`, `b=2`, `m_1=1`, `m_2=2`, `m_3=3`, `m_4=4`, `m_5=5`
     - The phone can turn off and on between each message, consuming `2` units each time.
     - Total consumed charge: `2 * 4 = 8` units (turning off/on 4 times).
     - Remaining charge: `10 - 8 = 2`.
     - The program correctly prints "YES" because the charge remains sufficient.
   
3. **Charge Sufficiency with Continuous On:**
   - Example: `n=3`, `f=11`, `a=9`, `b=6`, `m_1=6`, `m_2=8`, `m_3=10`
     - The phone stays on and consumes `9 * (10 - 0) = 90` units in total.
     - Remaining charge: `11 - 90 = -79`.
     - The program correctly prints "NO" because the charge drops below zero.
   
4. **Large Numbers:**
   - Example: `n=1`, `f=1000000000`, `a=1000000000`, `b=1000000000`, `m_1=1000000000`
     - The phone consumes `1000000000 * 1 = 1000000000` units to send the message.
     - Remaining charge: `1000000000 - 1000000000 = 0`.
     - The program correctly prints "NO" because the charge drops to zero after sending the message.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and testing it with various scenarios, it appears to correctly handle all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. The program consistently checks whether the phone can send all messages without its charge dropping to zero or below.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
