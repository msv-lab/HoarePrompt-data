Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, f, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9. m is a list of n integers such that 1 <= m_i <= 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, which is within the range 1 to 10^4. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they have not been affected by the provided code snippet.
