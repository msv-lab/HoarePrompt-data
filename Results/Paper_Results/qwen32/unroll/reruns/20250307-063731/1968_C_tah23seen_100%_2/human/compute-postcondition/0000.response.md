The code snippet initializes a list named `ans` with `n` elements, each set to \(10^9\). This operation does not affect the initial state of `arr` or `n`. Therefore, `arr` remains a list of integers where each integer \(x_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq x_i \leq 500\), and `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\).

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(x_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq x_i \leq 500\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\); `ans` is a list of \(n\) elements, each set to \(10^9\).**
