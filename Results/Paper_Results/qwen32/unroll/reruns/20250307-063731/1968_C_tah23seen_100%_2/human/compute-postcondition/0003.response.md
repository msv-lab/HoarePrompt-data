Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the output state.

The loop starts with `i` initialized to `n - 2` and continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. In each iteration, the value of `ans[i]` is updated to be `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, and then `i` is decremented by `1`.

Initially, `ans` is a list of `n` elements, each set to `10^9`. The loop modifies `ans` starting from the second-to-last element (index `n-2`) up to the first element (index `0`).

Here's how the loop modifies `ans`:
- For `i = n-2`, `ans[n-2]` is set to `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]`. Since `ans[n-1]` is `10^9`, `ans[n-2]` becomes `10^9 - arr[n-2]`.
- For `i = n-3`, `ans[n-3]` is set to `ans[n-2] - arr[n-3]`. Since `ans[n-2]` was just set to `10^9 - arr[n-2]`, `ans[n-3]` becomes `(10^9 - arr[n-2]) - arr[n-3]`, which simplifies to `10^9 - arr[n-2] - arr[n-3]`.
- This pattern continues until `i = 0`, where `ans[0]` is set to `ans[1] - arr[0]`. At this point, `ans[1]` would have been `10^9 - arr[1] - arr[2] - ... - arr[n-2]`, so `ans[0]` becomes `(10^9 - arr[1] - arr[2] - ... - arr[n-2]) - arr[0]`, which simplifies to `10^9 - arr[0] - arr[1] - arr[2] - ... - arr[n-2]`.

In summary, after the loop finishes, `ans[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `n-2` will be `10^9` minus the sum of all elements in `arr` from index `i` to `n-2`.

Output State: **`ans` is a list where `ans[i] = 10^9 - sum(arr[i:n])` for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, and `ans[n-1]` remains `10^9`.**
