Reasoning:
The provided program is incorrect based on the problem description and the execution summary. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate an array `a` such that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`. However, the implementation of `func_1` does not achieve this. Instead, it initializes `ans` with `10^9` and then iteratively sets `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, which does not guarantee that the modulo condition will be satisfied.

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

**Input:**
```
5
4
2 4 1
3
1 1
6
4 2 5 1 2
2
500
3
1 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 5 4 9
2 5 11
5 14 16 5 11 24
501 500
2 7 5
```

If we apply the function `func_1` as described, we will not get these outputs. Instead, the function incorrectly calculates the values based on the subtraction logic, which does not ensure that the modulo condition is met.

For example, in the first test case, the function would try to generate `ans` as follows:
- Initialize `ans` to `[1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]`.
- Then, it would set `ans[2] = ans[3] - 1 = 1000000000 - 1 = 999999999`.
- Next, `ans[1] = ans[2] - 4 = 999999999 - 4 = 999999995`.
- Finally, `ans[0] = ans[1] - 2 = 999999995 - 2 = 999999993`.

This does not satisfy the conditions `a_2 % a_1 = 2`, `a_3 % a_2 = 4`, and `a_4 % a_3 = 1`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
