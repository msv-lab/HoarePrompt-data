arr is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 representing the number of elements in the array a (where a_2, a_3, ..., a_n are the elements of arr). The function is called for each test case, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
