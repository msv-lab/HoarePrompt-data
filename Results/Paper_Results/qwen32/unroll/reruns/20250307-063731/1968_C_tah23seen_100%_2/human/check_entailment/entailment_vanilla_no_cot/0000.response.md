Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate an array `a` such that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i]` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly compute the values of `a` based on the given `x` values.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:
1. Start by setting `a[1]` to any value greater than or equal to `x[2]` (since `a[1] % a[0] = x[2]` and `a[0]` can be any value greater than `x[2]`).
2. For each subsequent `a[i]`, set it to a value such that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i]`. This can be achieved by setting `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i]` or any other value that satisfies the condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1  # a[1] can be any value greater than x[2]
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i]  # Ensure a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i]
    return ans

t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1
```

This version of the program correctly generates the array `a` based on the given `x` values.
