Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \). The function `func_1` is incorrectly calculating the values of the array \( a \).

The given code initializes the array `ans` with \( 10^9 \) and then tries to fill it in a way that doesn't satisfy the required modulo conditions. Specifically, the line `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` does not ensure that `arr[i]` is the remainder of `ans[i+1]` divided by `ans[i]`.

Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate this:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
3
1 1
```

Expected Output (one of the possible correct outputs):
```
2 5 11
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 5 \bmod 2 = 1 = x_2 \)
- \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 11 \bmod 5 = 1 = x_3 \)

However, the provided program will output something like:
```
1000000000 999999999 999999998
```
which does not satisfy the modulo conditions.

The correct approach should be to set \( a_1 \) to a sufficiently large number (such as \( 10^9 \)) and then set \( a_i \) to \( a_{i-1} + x_i \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \). This ensures that \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i \).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]
    return ans
```

This version ensures that the modulo conditions are met for all test cases.
