Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` where each `ans[i]` is calculated as `10^9 - sum(arr[i:n])` for `i` from `0` to `n-2`, and `ans[n-1]` is `10^9`.**

In simpler terms, the program returns the list `ans` where each element (except the last one) is `10^9` minus the sum of a slice of the list `arr` starting from the current index `i` to the end of the list, and the last element of `ans` is `10^9`.
