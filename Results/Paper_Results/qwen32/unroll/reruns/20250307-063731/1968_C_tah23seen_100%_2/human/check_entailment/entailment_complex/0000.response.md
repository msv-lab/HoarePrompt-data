Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by constructing an array `a` such that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`. However, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` is incorrect and does not guarantee that the output array `a` satisfies the required conditions.

Let's analyze the function `func_1`:
1. The array `ans` is initialized with `10^9` for all elements.
2. The loop iterates from the second last element to the first element of `arr`.
3. For each `i`, `ans[i]` is set to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.

This logic does not ensure that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i`. Instead, it seems to be trying to construct the array in a way that subtracts the current `x_i` from the next element in `ans`. This approach does not account for the modulo operation and does not guarantee that the resulting `ans` array will satisfy the given conditions.

The correct approach would be to construct the array `a` starting from `a_1` and ensuring that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`. One possible way to do this is to set `a_1` to a large number (like `10^9`), and then set `a_i` to `a_{i-1} + x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`. This ensures that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` because `a_i` is constructed such that it leaves a remainder of `x_i` when divided by `a_{i-1}`.

Since the provided function `func_1` does not implement this logic, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
