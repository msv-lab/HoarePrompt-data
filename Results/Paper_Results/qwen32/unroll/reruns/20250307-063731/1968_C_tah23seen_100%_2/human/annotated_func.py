#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 representing the number of elements in the array a (where a_2, a_3, ..., a_n are the elements of arr). The function is called for each test case, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: `ans` is a list where `ans[i] = 10^9 - sum(arr[i:n])` for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, and `ans[n-1]` remains `10^9`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans` where each `ans[i]` is calculated as `10^9 - sum(arr[i:n])` for `i` from `0` to `n-2`, and `ans[n-1]` is `10^9`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n` representing the number of elements in `arr`. It returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-2` is calculated as `10^9 - sum(arr[i:n])`, and `ans[n-1]` is `10^9`.
