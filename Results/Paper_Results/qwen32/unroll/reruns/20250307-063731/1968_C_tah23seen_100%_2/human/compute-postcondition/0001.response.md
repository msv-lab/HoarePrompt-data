The variable `i` is assigned the value `n - 2`. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(x_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq x_i \leq 500\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\); `ans` is a list of \(n\) elements, each set to \(10^9\); `i` is `n - 2`.
