The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `0`, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`. Given that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\), the smallest possible value for `n` is `2`. If `n` is `2`, then `i` is `2 - 2 = 0`, which satisfies the condition `i >= 0`.

No other states need to be adjusted because `i` is the only variable in the loop head, and adjusting it to be `0` (or any positive integer) will allow the loop to execute.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(x_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq x_i \leq 500\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\); `ans` is a list of \(n\) elements, each set to \(10^9\); `i` is 0 or greater**
