To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to verify and adjust the conditions specified in the loop head. The loop condition is `low <= high`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of buns.
- `a` is an integer representing the usual price of a bun.
- `b` is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `min(n, b)`.
- `max_profit` is 0.

Let's analyze the loop condition `low <= high`:
- `low` is explicitly set to 0.
- `high` is set to `min(n, b)`, which means `high` will be the smaller of `n` and `b`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `low <= high` must be true. Since `low` is 0, `high` must be at least 0 for the condition to hold. Given that `high` is defined as `min(n, b)`, and both `n` and `b` are integers, `high` will always be a non-negative integer (assuming `n` and `b` are non-negative, which is typical for counts and prices).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute at least once, as the initial conditions already satisfy `low <= high`.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of buns, `a` is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, and `b` is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price; `low` is 0; `high` is `min(n, b)`; `max_profit` is 0**.
