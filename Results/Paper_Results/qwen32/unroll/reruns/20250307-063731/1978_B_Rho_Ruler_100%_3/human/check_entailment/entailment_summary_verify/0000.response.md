### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program to ensure it correctly computes the maximum profit based on the problem description and function summaries.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`, where `k` is the number of buns sold at the modified price.
   - The first `k` buns are sold at prices `(b - i + 1)` for `i` in `1` to `k`.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
     \]
   - This formula correctly computes the total profit for a given `k`.

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It iterates over possible values of `k` within the range `[0, \min(n, b)]`.
   - It uses `func_1` to compute the profit for each `k` and keeps track of the maximum profit found.
   - The binary search approach is efficient and ensures that the optimal `k` is found within the constraints.

#### Key Points to Verify:

- **Correctness of `func_1`**: The formula used in `func_1` is mathematically correct and matches the problem description.
- **Correctness of `func_2`**: The binary search approach is appropriate and efficient for finding the maximum profit. It correctly updates the `max_profit` variable and narrows down the search space based on the comparison of profits.

#### Edge Cases to Consider:

- **Small values of `n`, `a`, and `b`**: The function should work correctly for small inputs.
- **Large values of `n`, `a`, and `b`**: The function should handle large inputs efficiently due to the binary search approach.
- **`k = 0` and `k = n`**: The function should handle these edge cases correctly.
- **`b < a`**: The function should correctly handle cases where the modified price is less than the usual price.

#### Testing:

Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases to ensure its correctness.

### Example Test Cases:

1. **Example 1**: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - Expected output: `17`

2. **Example 2**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Expected output: `35`

3. **Example 3**: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
   - Expected output: `100`

4. **Example 4**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Expected output: `45`

5. **Example 5**: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
   - Expected output: `1000000000000000000`

6. **Example 6**: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1`
   - Expected output: `1000000000000000000`

7. **Example 7**: `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
   - Expected output: `500500`

8. **Edge Case 1**: `n = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`
   - Expected output: `1`

9. **Edge Case 2**: `n = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 2`
   - Expected output: `2`

10. **Edge Case 3**: `n = 10`, `a = 5`, `b = 3`
    - Expected output: `50`

### Implementation and Testing:

Let's run the provided code with these test cases to verify its correctness:

```python
#Function 1:
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (0, min(n, b))
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return max_profit

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    (4, 4, 5),
    (5, 5, 9),
    (10, 10, 5),
    (5, 5, 11),
    (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000),
    (1000000000, 1000000000, 1),
    (1000, 1, 1000),
    (1, 1, 1),
    (1, 1, 2),
    (10, 5, 3)
]

# Expected outputs
expected_outputs = [
    17,
    35,
    100,
    45,
    1000000000000000000,
    1000000000000000000,
    500500,
    1,
    2,
    50
]

# Run test cases
results = [func_2(n, a, b) for n, a, b in test_cases]
print(results == expected_outputs)  # Should print True if all test cases pass
```
