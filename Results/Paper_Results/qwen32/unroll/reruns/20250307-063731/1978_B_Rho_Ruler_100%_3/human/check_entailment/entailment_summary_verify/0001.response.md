### Reasoning

Let's carefully review the problem description, the provided code, and the function summaries to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap
Bob aims to maximize profit by selling `n` buns. The first `k` buns can be sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `(b - k + 1)`, while the remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

#### Program Code and Function Summaries

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the profit based on a given `k`.
   - **Formula**: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`
     - `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the series from `b` to `(b - k + 1)`.
     - `(n - k) * a` calculates the profit from selling the remaining buns at the usual price `a`.
   - **Correctness**: This formula correctly computes the total profit for a specific `k` by summing the profits from the first `k` buns and the remaining `(n - k)` buns.

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function finds the maximum profit by searching for the optimal `k` using binary search.
   - **Binary Search Approach**:
     - The search range is from `0` to `min(n, b)`.
     - For each midpoint `mid`, it calculates the profit using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
     - It adjusts the search range based on the comparison of these profits.
   - **Correctness**: The binary search ensures efficiency and correctly identifies the `k` that maximizes the profit.

#### Function Summary Recap
- The function summary for `func_2` correctly states that it calculates and returns the maximum profit achievable by selling `n` buns with the given constraints.

### Validation
- **Profit Calculation**: The formula in `func_1` correctly calculates the profit for any `k` by summing the profits from the first `k` buns (using the arithmetic series sum) and the remaining `(n - k)` buns.
- **Binary Search**: The binary search in `func_2` efficiently narrows down the optimal `k` by comparing profits at `mid` and `mid + 1`, ensuring that the maximum profit is found.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic required to find the maximum profit by selling the buns with the given promotion rules. Both functions are correctly implemented, and the binary search approach ensures efficiency and correctness.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
