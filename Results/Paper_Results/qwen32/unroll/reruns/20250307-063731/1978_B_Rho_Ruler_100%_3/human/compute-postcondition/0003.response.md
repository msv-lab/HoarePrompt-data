To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to understand the purpose of the loop and the function `func_1`. The loop is performing a binary search to find the maximum profit that can be achieved by selling a certain number of buns at a modified price.

The loop variables `low`, `high`, and `mid` are used to narrow down the number of buns (`mid`) that should be sold at the modified price `b` to maximize the profit. The `max_profit` variable keeps track of the highest profit encountered during the search.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's operation:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `low` starts at 0.
   - `high` starts at `min(n, b)`, which is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price.
   - `max_profit` starts at 0.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - The loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.
   - `profit_mid` is the profit when `mid` buns are sold at the modified price `b`.
   - `profit_next` is the profit when `mid + 1` buns are sold at the modified price `b`.
   - `max_profit` is updated to be the maximum of the current `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.
   - If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, it means selling more buns at the modified price increases the profit, so `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `low` exceeds `high`.
   - At this point, `max_profit` holds the maximum profit that can be achieved by selling a certain number of buns at the modified price.

Given the loop's purpose, the final state of the variables will be:

- `low` and `high` will not be relevant for the final output state since the loop terminates when `low` exceeds `high`.
- `mid` will be the last value calculated in the loop, but it's not directly relevant to the final output state.
- `max_profit` will hold the maximum profit achievable.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **max_profit is the maximum profit achievable by selling a certain number of buns at the modified price.**

In natural language, after the loop finishes, `max_profit` will contain the highest profit that can be achieved by selling a certain number of buns at the modified price `b`. The values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` will not be meaningful in the context of the final output state.
