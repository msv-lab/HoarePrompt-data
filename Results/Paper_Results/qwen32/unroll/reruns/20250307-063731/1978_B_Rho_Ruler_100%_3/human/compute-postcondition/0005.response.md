Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of buns), `a` (the usual price of a bun), and `b` (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). It returns `max_profit`, which is the maximum profit achievable by selling the buns, with the option to sell the first bun at the modified price `b` if it is more profitable than the usual price `a`.**
