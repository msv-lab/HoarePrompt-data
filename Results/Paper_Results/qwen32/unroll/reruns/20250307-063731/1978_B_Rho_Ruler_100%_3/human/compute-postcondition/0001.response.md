The code snippet provided initializes `max_profit` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, or `high`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of buns, `a` is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, and `b` is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price; `low` is 0; `high` is `min(n, b)`; `max_profit` is 0.**
