Reasoning:  
The given problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns under the given promotion rules. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:  
   This function calculates the profit if Bob sells the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price. The formula used is:
   \[
   \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
   \]
   - `k * b` calculates the total price of the first `k` buns if sold at the price `b`.
   - `\frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2}` is the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, which is subtracted to adjust the price of the first `k` buns according to the promotion (i.e., the price of the i-th bun is `(b - i + 1)`).
   - `(n - k) * a` calculates the total price of the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:  
   This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum of `n` and `b` (since the price of the i-th bun cannot be negative, `k` cannot exceed `b`).
   - It iteratively narrows down the search space by comparing the profit at the midpoint (`mid`) and the profit at `mid + 1`.
   - If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater than the profit at `mid`, it means the optimal `k` is likely higher, so it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - It keeps track of the maximum profit found during the search.

The binary search in `func_2` ensures that the program efficiently finds the optimal `k` within the range `[0, min(n, b)]`. Given the constraints (up to \(10^9\) for `n`, `a`, and `b`), the binary search approach is appropriate and efficient.

The example test cases provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program, as the output matches the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
