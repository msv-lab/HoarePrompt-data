Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of buns, `a` is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, and `b` is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. All of `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is `min(n, b)`.**

In natural language: The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their initial values representing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the modified price of the first bun respectively. Two new variables `low` and `high` are introduced where `low` is set to 0 and `high` is set to the minimum value between `n` and `b`.
