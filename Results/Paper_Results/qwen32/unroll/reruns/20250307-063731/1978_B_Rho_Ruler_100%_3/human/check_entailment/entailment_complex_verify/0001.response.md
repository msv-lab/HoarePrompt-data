### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version of the code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Bob sells `n` buns.
- Usual price per bun is `a` coins.
- For the first `k` buns, the price is `(b - i + 1)` coins for the `i`-th bun.
- Remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
- Determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - Calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - Formula used: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
   - This formula correctly computes the profit as:
     - Sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series starting at `b` and ending at `(b - k + 1)`.
     - Plus the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at `a` coins each.
   
2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - Uses binary search to find the optimal `k` between `0` and `min(n, b)`.
   - Compares the profit at `mid` and `mid + 1` to adjust the search range.
   - Ensures the maximum profit is found efficiently.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm the state and behavior of the program at key points.
- The annotations align with the logic described in the original assessment.

#### Correctness:
- The profit calculation in `func_1` is accurate.
- The binary search in `func_2` correctly identifies the `k` that maximizes the profit.
- The logic and implementation in both functions match the problem requirements.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates and outputs the maximum profit for each test case based on the given problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: True**

The provided program is correct.
