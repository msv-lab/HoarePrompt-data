You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

Bob wants to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns. He can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price of `(b - i + 1)` coins each for the first `i` buns, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a` coins each.

The goal is to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the total profit.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated as `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`. This formula comes from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `(b - k + 1)`.
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function finds the maximum profit by searching for the optimal `k` between `0` and `min(n, b)`.
   - It uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the `k` that gives the maximum profit.
   - During each iteration, it calculates the profit for the current `mid` value and the next `mid + 1` value.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it means the optimal `k` is to the right of `mid`, so `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the optimal `k` is to the left of `mid`, so `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
   - The maximum profit found during the search is returned.

### Correctness

The program uses a binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit. This approach is efficient and ensures that the solution is found within the constraints given (with `n` and `b` up to \(10^9\)).

The profit calculation in `func_1` is correct based on the problem description. The binary search in `func_2` correctly narrows down the optimal `k` by comparing profits at `mid` and `mid + 1`.

Given that both functions are implemented correctly and the logic aligns with the problem's requirements, the program should produce the correct maximum profit for each test case.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
