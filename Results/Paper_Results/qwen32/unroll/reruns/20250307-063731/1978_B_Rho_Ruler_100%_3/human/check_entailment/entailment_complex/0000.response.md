### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling `n` buns where the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining buns are sold at the usual price. The modified price of the `i-th` bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.

The given program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(k, n, a, b)`: This function calculates the profit for a given `k` using the formula `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. This formula correctly computes the profit based on the problem's description.
2. `func_2(n, a, b)`: This function performs a binary search on `k` to find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit. It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`, then iterates to find the maximum profit by comparing the profit at `mid` and `mid + 1`.

The binary search approach is appropriate because the profit function is unimodal in `k`. This means that the profit first increases and then decreases as `k` increases, allowing us to efficiently find the maximum using binary search.

The main function reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the result using `func_2`.

Given the problem constraints and the implementation, the functions together correctly compute the maximum profit for each test case.
