### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the annotations and the provided problem description.

#### Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`:
- **Purpose**: Computes the profit for a given `k`, where `k` is the number of buns sold at the modified price.
- **Formula**: \( k \times b - k \times \frac{(k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \)
  - `k * b`: Total revenue from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price.
  - `k * (k - 1) // 2`: Sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, representing the total discount applied to the first `k` buns.
  - `(n - k) * a`: Revenue from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price.

This formula correctly calculates the profit for any given `k`.

#### Function `func_2(n, a, b)`:
- **Purpose**: Finds the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit using a binary search approach.
- **Binary Search**:
  - **Initialization**: `low = 0`, `high = min(n, b)`.
  - **Loop**: Continues as long as `low <= high`.
  - **Mid Calculation**: `mid = (low + high) // 2`.
  - **Profit Calculation**: `profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
  - **Max Profit Update**: `max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)`.
  - **Adjust Search Range**:
    - If `profit_next > profit_mid`, it means the profit is increasing, so move `low` to `mid + 1`.
    - Otherwise, move `high` to `mid - 1`.

This binary search approach efficiently finds the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.

#### Annotations:
- **State of the program before the function call**: Annotations confirm that the input values are within the specified constraints.
- **State during the function call**: Annotations describe the state of variables (`low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, `max_profit`) at key points in the code.
- **State after the function call**: The final `max_profit` is correctly computed and returned.

#### Test Cases:
- The program is tested with multiple test cases, including edge cases and large values, and it produces the expected outputs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to compute the maximum profit for selling the buns under the given promotion rules. The binary search approach ensures that the solution is efficient even for large inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
