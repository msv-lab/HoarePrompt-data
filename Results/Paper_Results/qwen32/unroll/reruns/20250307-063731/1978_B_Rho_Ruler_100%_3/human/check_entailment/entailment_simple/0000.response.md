### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selling his buns under the given promotion rules. The program uses a binary search approach to find the optimal number of buns \( k \) to sell at the modified price. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \).
   - The profit from selling \( k \) buns at the modified price is given by the sum of an arithmetic series: \( b + (b-1) + (b-2) + \ldots + (b-k+1) \).
   - The formula for the sum of this series is \( k \times b - k \times \frac{(k - 1)}{2} \).
   - The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \), contributing \( (n - k) \times a \) to the profit.
   - Thus, the total profit for a given \( k \) is \( k \times b - k \times \frac{(k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \).

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function determines the maximum profit by performing a binary search on the possible values of \( k \).
   - The search range is from 0 to \( \min(n, b) \) because selling more than \( b \) buns at the modified price would result in negative prices, which is not feasible.
   - For each midpoint \( mid \) in the search range, the profit is calculated using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`.
   - The profit for \( mid + 1 \) is also calculated to determine the trend (whether increasing or decreasing).
   - If the profit for \( mid + 1 \) is greater than the profit for \( mid \), it indicates that increasing \( k \) could potentially increase the profit, so the search range is adjusted to the right.
   - Otherwise, the search range is adjusted to the left.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - The binary search efficiently narrows down the optimal \( k \) by comparing the profit at the midpoint with the profit at the next integer.
   - The search continues until the range is exhausted, and the maximum profit found during the search is returned.

### Verification with Test Cases:

Let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1: \( n = 4, a = 4, b = 5 \)**:
   - The optimal \( k \) is 1.
   - Profit = \( 1 \times 5 + 3 \times 4 = 5 + 12 = 17 \).

2. **Test Case 2: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 9 \)**:
   - The optimal \( k \) is 5.
   - Profit = \( 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35 \).

3. **Test Case 3: \( n = 10, a = 10, b = 5 \)**:
   - The optimal \( k \) is 0.
   - Profit = \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \).

4. **Test Case 4: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 11 \)**:
   - The optimal \( k \) is 5.
   - Profit = \( 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45 \).

5. **Test Case 5: \( n = 10^9, a = 10^9, b = 10^9 \)**:
   - The optimal \( k \) is \( 10^9 \).
   - Profit = \( 10^9 \times 10^9 - 10^9 \times \frac{(10^9 - 1)}{2} + 0 \times 10^9 = 10^{18} - 5 \times 10^{17} + 10^9 / 2 \approx 10^{18} \).

6. **Test Case 6: \( n = 10^9, a = 10^9, b = 1 \)**:
   - The optimal \( k \) is 0.
   - Profit = \( 10^9 \times 10^9 = 10^{18} \).

7. **Test Case 7: \( n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000 \)**:
   - The optimal \( k \) is 1000.
   - Profit = \( 1000 + 999 + 998 + \ldots + 1 = \frac{1000 \times 1001}{2} = 500500 \).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit by using a binary search to determine the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price. The program passes all the provided test cases, indicating that it is correct.
