To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that it accurately computes the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns under the given promotion rules. Let's analyze the logic and implementation of the provided functions.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the profit when `k` buns are sold at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price.
   - The profit for the first `k` buns is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series: `b + (b-1) + (b-2) + ... + (b-k+1)`, which can be simplified to `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
   - The profit for the remaining `n - k` buns is `(n - k) * a`.
   - This function correctly computes the profit for a given `k`.

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function determines the maximum profit by binary searching over the possible values of `k` from `0` to `min(n, b)`.
   - It initializes `low` to `0` and `high` to `min(n, b)`.
   - It iteratively calculates the profit for the middle value `mid` and the next value `mid + 1`.
   - It updates `max_profit` with the maximum of the current `max_profit` and the profit at `mid`.
   - If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater than the profit at `mid`, it updates `low` to `mid + 1` to search in the higher half. Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1` to search in the lower half.
   - This function correctly finds the maximum profit by leveraging the binary search approach.

### Conclusion

Both functions are correctly implemented to solve the problem. The binary search in `func_2` ensures that we find the optimal `k` efficiently, and `func_1` correctly computes the profit for any given `k`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
