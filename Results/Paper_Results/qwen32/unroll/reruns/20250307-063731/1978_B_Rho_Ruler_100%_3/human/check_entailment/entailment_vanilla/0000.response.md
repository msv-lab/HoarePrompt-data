Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

Bob wants to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns. He can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price of `(b - i + 1)` coins each for the first `i` buns, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a` coins each.

The goal is to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the total profit.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated as `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`. This formula comes from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `(b - k + 1)`.
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function finds the maximum profit by searching for the optimal `k` between `0` and `min(n, b)`.
   - It uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the `k` that gives the maximum profit.
   - During each iteration, it calculates the profit for the current `mid` value and the next `mid + 1` value.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it means the optimal `k` is to the right of `mid`, so `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the optimal `k` is to the left of `mid`, so `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
   - The maximum profit found during the search is returned.

### Correctness

The program uses a binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit. This approach is efficient and ensures that the solution is found within the constraints given (with `n` and `b` up to \(10^9\)).

The profit calculation in `func_1` is correct based on the problem description. The binary search in `func_2` correctly narrows down the optimal `k` by comparing profits at `mid` and `mid + 1`.

Given that both functions are implemented correctly and the logic aligns with the problem's requirements, the program should produce the correct maximum profit for each test case.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
