You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis:

The provided program consists of two functions:

1. `func_1(k, n, a, b)`: This function calculates the profit for a given `k`, where `k` is the number of buns sold at the modified price.

2. `func_2(n, a, b)`: This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit. It iterates over possible values of `k` and uses `func_1` to compute the profit for each `k`. It then determines the maximum profit.

### Key Points to Verify:

- **Correctness of `func_1`**: It correctly calculates the profit for a given `k`:
  - The first `k` buns are sold at prices `(b - i + 1)` for `i` in `1` to `k`.
  - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
  
- **Correctness of `func_2`**: It correctly finds the maximum profit by iterating over possible values of `k`:
  - It uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the optimal `k`.
  - It updates the `max_profit` variable to keep track of the highest profit found.
  
### Edge Cases to Consider:

- **Small values of `n`, `a`, and `b`**: Ensure the function works correctly for small inputs.
- **Large values of `n`, `a`, and `b`**: Ensure the function works efficiently for large inputs.
- **`k = 0` and `k = n`**: Ensure the function handles these edge cases correctly.
- **`b < a`**: Ensure the function correctly handles cases where the modified price is less than the usual price.

### Testing:

Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases to ensure its correctness.

### Example Test Cases:

1. **Example 1**: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - Expected output: `17`

2. **Example 2**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Expected output: `35`

3. **Example 3**: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
   - Expected output: `100`

4. **Example 4**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Expected output: `45`

5. **Example 5**: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
   - Expected output: `1000000000000000000`

6. **Example 6**: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1`
   - Expected output: `1000000000000000000`

7. **Example 7**: `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
   - Expected output: `500500`

8. **Edge Case 1**: `n = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`
   - Expected output: `1`

9. **Edge Case 2**: `n = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 2`
   - Expected output: `2`

10. **Edge Case 3**: `n = 10`, `a = 5`, `b = 3`
    - Expected output: `50`

### Implementation and Testing:

Let's run the provided code with these test cases to verify its correctness:

```python
#Function 1:
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (0, min(n, b))
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return max_profit

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    (4, 4, 5),
    (5, 5, 9),
    (10, 10, 5),
    (5, 5, 11),
    (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000),
    (1000000000, 1000000000, 1),
    (1000, 1, 1000),
    (1, 1, 1),
    (1, 1, 2),

    1000000000000000000,
    1000000000000000000,
    500500,
    1,
    2,
    50
]

# Run test cases
results = [func_2(n, a, b) for n, a, b in test_cases]
print(results == expected_outputs)  # Should print True if all test cases pass
```

### Output:

The above code should print `True` if all test cases pass, indicating that the program is correct for the given test cases.
