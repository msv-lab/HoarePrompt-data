To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop condition, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop condition `while i < n:`, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`. The initial state provided is:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5
- `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'
- `counter` is 0
- `i` is 0

In this state, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5. Since `n` is at least 1, the condition `i < n` (0 < n) will always be true. Therefore, no adjustments need to be made to the state for the loop to execute its first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `counter` is 0, `i` is 0**
