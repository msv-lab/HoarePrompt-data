The code snippet initializes a variable `counter` to 0. The initial state of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remains unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `counter` is 0.**
