Reasoning:  
The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by counting mismatches between the initial and desired states of the boxes and applying specific rules to determine the minimum number of operations required. However, the logic within `func_1` is not correct for solving the problem as described. 

The logic in the function does not correctly account for the operations that can be performed:
1. Adding a cat to an empty box.
2. Removing a cat from a box.
3. Moving a cat from one box to another.

The function seems to be counting mismatches and making assumptions about the operations required to fix them, but it does not handle the cases where a cat needs to be moved from one box to another or added/removed correctly. 

For example, in the first test case, the initial state is "10010" and the desired state is "00001". The function would incorrectly count the number of mismatches and not account for the optimal way to move the cats to achieve the desired state.

The correct approach would involve counting the number of cats that need to be added, removed, and moved, and then determining the minimum number of operations based on these counts.

Correctness: **False**
