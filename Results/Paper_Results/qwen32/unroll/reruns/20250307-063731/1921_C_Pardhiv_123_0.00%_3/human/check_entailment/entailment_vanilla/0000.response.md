Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

Stepan needs to send messages at specific times, and his phone's battery drains over time. He can turn the phone off and on, which consumes additional battery. The goal is to determine if Stepan can send all messages without the phone running out of battery.

### Key Points

1. **Initial Battery Charge:** `f`
2. **Battery Drain per Unit Time:** `a`
3. **Battery Drain for Turn On/Off:** `b`
4. **Message Times:** `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`

### Logic to Solve the Problem

1. **Initial Setup:** Start with the initial battery charge `f`.
2. **Iterate Over Message Times:** For each consecutive pair of message times `m_i` and `m_{i+1}`:
   - Calculate the battery drain if the phone stays on from `m_i` to `m_{i+1}`: `a * (m_{i+1} - m_i)`.
   - Compare this with the battery drain for turning the phone off and on: `b`.
   - Subtract the smaller value from the current battery charge `f`.
3. **Check Final Battery Charge:** After processing all messages, if `f > 0`, output "YES"; otherwise, output "NO".

### Program Analysis

The provided program follows the above logic correctly:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the list of message times.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes the battery charge `f`.
   - For each pair of consecutive message times, it calculates the battery drain for staying on and turning off/on.
   - It subtracts the smaller value from `f`.
   
3. **Output:**
   - After processing all message times for a test case, it checks if `f > 0` and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

### Edge Cases

- **Single Message:** The program correctly handles the case where there is only one message.
- **Initial Battery Charge:** The program correctly handles cases where the initial battery charge is very high or very low.
- **Large Numbers:** The program uses integer arithmetic, which should handle the upper limits provided in the problem statement (e.g., `10^9`).

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages without the phone running out of battery. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
