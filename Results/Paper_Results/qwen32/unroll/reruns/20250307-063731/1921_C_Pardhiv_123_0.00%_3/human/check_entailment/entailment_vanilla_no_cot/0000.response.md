Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle the scenario where the phone needs to be turned off and on multiple times to send all messages without running out of charge. The current implementation only considers turning the phone off and on once between each pair of consecutive messages, which may not be sufficient in some cases.

To fix the program, we need to ensure that we can turn the phone off and on multiple times between each pair of messages if necessary to maintain enough charge to send the next message. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        (n, f, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        ls = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ls = [0] + ls  # Add initial time 0 for easier calculation
        can_send = True
        for i in range(1, len(ls)):
            time_diff = ls[i] - ls[i - 1]
            # Calculate the minimum cost to send the message at ls[i]
            # We can either keep the phone on or turn it off and on
            while f < a * time_diff:
                # Turn off and on the phone
                if f < b:
                    can_send = False
                    break
                f -= b
                time_diff -= 1
            if not can_send:
                break
            f -= a * time_diff
            if f <= 0:
                can_send = False
                break
        if can_send:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        t -= 1

func()
```

In this corrected version, we add an initial time of 0 to the list of message times for easier calculation. For each message, we check if we can send it by either keeping the phone on or by turning it off and on multiple times if necessary. If at any point we cannot send a message because the charge is insufficient, we output "NO". Otherwise, we output "YES".
