`t` is assigned the value of `int(input(''))`, which means `t` is now an integer read from the input. The other variables (`n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `m`) remain unchanged as they have not been assigned any values yet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are as initially described.**
