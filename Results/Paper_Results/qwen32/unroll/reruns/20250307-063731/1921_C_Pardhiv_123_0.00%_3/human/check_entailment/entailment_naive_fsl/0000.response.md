Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description. Specifically, it does not account for the initial charge being insufficient to send the first message without turning the phone on and off. 

Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
1 1 1 5
1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- Stepan needs to send a message at moment 1.
- The phone starts with 1 unit of charge.
- The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time.
- Since the phone is on at moment 0, it will lose 1 unit of charge by moment 1, leaving it with 0 units of charge.
- At moment 1, the phone has 0 units of charge, so it cannot send the message.

**Program Output:**
```
YES
```

The program incorrectly outputs "YES" because it does not consider the initial charge consumption before sending the first message. The program should account for the fact that the phone needs to be turned on and off if the initial charge is insufficient to cover the charge consumption until the first message needs to be sent.

To fix this, the program should check if the initial charge `f` is sufficient to send the first message at `ls[0]` without turning the phone on and off. If not, it should consider the cost of turning the phone on and off. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        (n, f, a, b) = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        ls = list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        # Check if the initial charge is sufficient to send the first message
        if f < a * ls[0]:
            f -= b  # Turn off and on the phone
        for i in range(1, len(ls)):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        if f >= 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        t -= 1

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the initial charge is sufficient to send the first message, considering the cost of turning the phone on and off if necessary.
