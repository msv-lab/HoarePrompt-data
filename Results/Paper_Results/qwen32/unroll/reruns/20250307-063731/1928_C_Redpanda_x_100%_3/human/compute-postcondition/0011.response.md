Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer greater than 1, and returns some value based on the properties of `n`.** 

(Note: Since the specific output conditions are not provided, I've described the input constraint and mentioned that the function returns a value based on the properties of `n`. If you provide the specific output conditions, I can refine the functionality description further.)
