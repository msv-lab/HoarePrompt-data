You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        i += 1
    if nn > 1:
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    primes = list(factors.keys())

    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor

#Function 2:
def generate(k):
    if k == len(primes):
        yield 1
    else:
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield (factor * prime_to_i)
                prime_to_i *= prime



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `generate` generates a series of integers based on the input `k` and the global variables `primes` and `factors`. It recursively yields values that are products of primes raised to various powers, as defined by the `factors` dictionary. The final state of the program after it concludes is that all possible combinations of these products have been yielded.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly solve the given problem. The task requires determining how many natural numbers \( k \) fit under the given constraints, specifically for a given position \( n \) and number \( x \) received during the settling process.

The settling process is described as follows:
- The first \( k \) people have numbers \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k \).
- The next \( k - 2 \) people have numbers \( k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 \).
- This pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

The provided code includes two functions, `func_1` and `generate`, which appear to be intended to generate factors of a number, but they are not directly related to solving the problem of finding valid \( k \) values.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Understand the repeating pattern of the settling process.
2. Determine the valid \( k \) values for which the position \( n \) corresponds to the number \( x \).

Let's outline the steps to solve the problem correctly:
1. For each test case, iterate over possible values of \( k \).
2. Determine the position within the repeating pattern.
3. Check if the number at that position matches \( x \).

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:

```python
def count_valid_ks(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        cycle_length = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_cycle = (n - 1) % cycle_length
        if position_in_cycle < k - 1:
            if position_in_cycle + 1 == x:
                count += 1
        else:
            if k - (position_in_cycle - (k - 2) - 1) == x:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    t = int(input[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        x = int(input[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(count_valid_ks(n, x))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Code:
1. **count_valid_ks(n, x)**: This function iterates over possible values of \( k \) from 2 to \( n \).
2. **cycle_length**: The length of the repeating pattern is \( 2k - 2 \).
3. **position_in_cycle**: The position within the repeating pattern is determined by \( (n - 1) \% \text{cycle\_length} \).
4. **Check conditions**: Depending on the position within the cycle, check if it matches the number \( x \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The correct solution involves iterating over possible values of \( k \) and checking the conditions based on the settling pattern.
