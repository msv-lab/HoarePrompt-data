The code snippet `yield 1` will produce a generator object that yields the value `1` but does not change the values of the variables `k`, `n`, or `x`. The precondition that `k` is a non-negative integer, and `n` and `x` are integers such that `1 <= x < n <= 10^9` remains valid.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, and a value of 1 has been yielded.**
