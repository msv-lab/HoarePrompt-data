Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not seem to implement the logic required to solve the problem described. The code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `generate`, but neither of them appears to address the problem of finding the number of valid `k` values for given `n` and `x`.

The problem requires determining how many natural numbers `k` fit the constraints such that, in a sequence where the first `k` numbers are `1, 2, 3, ..., k`, the next `k-2` numbers are `k-1, k-2, ..., 2`, and this pattern repeats, the number `x` appears at position `n`.

The provided code seems to be attempting to generate factors of a number `n`, but it does not use these factors to determine the valid `k` values. The code also does not handle the input and output requirements specified in the problem description.

To be correct, the program should:
1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.
2. For each test case, determine the number of valid `k` values that satisfy the condition.
3. Output the result for each test case.

Since the provided code does not perform these steps, it is incorrect.
