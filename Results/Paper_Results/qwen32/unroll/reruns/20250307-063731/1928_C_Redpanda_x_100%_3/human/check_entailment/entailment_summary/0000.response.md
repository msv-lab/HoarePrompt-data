### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that a given position \( n \) in a line results in a specific number \( x \) after the described "first-k-th" settling process. The settling process repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

The provided code attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the position \( n \) and the number \( x \).
3. Using two different calculations to find potential values of \( k \):
   - The first calculation involves the difference \( h = n - x \).
   - The second calculation involves the sum \( h = n + x - 2 \) (only if \( x \neq 1 \)).
4. Both calculations use `func_1` and `generate` to yield potential values of \( k \).
5. Filtering these potential values to ensure they are even and meet the condition \( k / 2 + 1 \geq x \).
6. Combining the results from both calculations and printing the number of unique \( k \) values.

However, there are issues with the provided code:
- The `func_1` and `generate` functions are not correctly implemented to yield the correct factors and combinations.
- The `generate` function relies on global variables `primes` and `factors`, which are not defined within the scope of the function.
- The logic for determining the potential \( k \) values is not correctly implemented based on the problem's requirements.

The main issue is that the code does not correctly implement the logic to find the potential values of \( k \) based on the position \( n \) and the number \( x \). The problem requires understanding the repeating pattern and calculating the valid \( k \) values based on the position within the repeating sequence.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the reasoning above, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
