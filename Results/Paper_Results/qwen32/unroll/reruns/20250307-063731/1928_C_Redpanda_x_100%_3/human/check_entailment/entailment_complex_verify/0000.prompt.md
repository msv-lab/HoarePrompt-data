You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:

            nn //= i

    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:

    primes = list(factors.keys())

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` greater than 1 and yields its prime factors.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is a non-negative integer, n and x are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9.
def generate(k):
    if (k == len(primes)) :
        yield 1

        #State: `factor` has taken on all values from `rest`, `prime_to_i` is 1 (at the end of the last inner loop iteration, but this value is not retained after the loop), and the loop has yielded a series of values based on `factor * prime_to_i` for each inner loop iteration.
    #State: `k` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9. If `k` equals the length of `primes`, a value of 1 has been yielded. Otherwise, `factor` has taken on all values from `rest`, `prime_to_i` is 1 (at the end of the last inner loop iteration, but this value is not retained after the loop), and the loop has yielded a series of values based on `factor * prime_to_i` for each inner loop iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `generate` generates a series of integers based on the input `k` and the global variables `primes` and `factors`. It recursively yields values that are products of primes raised to various powers, as defined by the `factors` dictionary. The final state of the program after it concludes is that all possible combinations of these products have been yielded.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not seem to implement the logic required to solve the problem described. The code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `generate`, but neither of them appears to address the problem of finding the number of valid `k` values for given `n` and `x`.

The problem requires determining how many natural numbers `k` fit the constraints such that, in a sequence where the first `k` numbers are `1, 2, 3, ..., k`, the next `k-2` numbers are `k-1, k-2, ..., 2`, and this pattern repeats, the number `x` appears at position `n`.

The provided code seems to be attempting to generate factors of a number `n`, but it does not use these factors to determine the valid `k` values. The code also does not handle the input and output requirements specified in the problem description.

To be correct, the program should:
1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.
2. For each test case, determine the number of valid `k` values that satisfy the condition.
3. Output the result for each test case.

Since the provided code does not perform these steps, it is incorrect.
