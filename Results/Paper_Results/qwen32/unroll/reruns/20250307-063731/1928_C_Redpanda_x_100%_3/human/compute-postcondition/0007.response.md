Postcondition: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9. If `k` equals the length of `primes`, a value of 1 has been yielded. Otherwise, `factor` has taken on all values from `rest`, `prime_to_i` is 1 (at the end of the last inner loop iteration, but this value is not retained after the loop), and the loop has yielded a series of values based on `factor * prime_to_i` for each inner loop iteration.**
