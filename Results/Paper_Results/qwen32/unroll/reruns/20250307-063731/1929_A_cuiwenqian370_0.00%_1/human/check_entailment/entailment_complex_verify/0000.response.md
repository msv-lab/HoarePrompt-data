Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step. The goal is to determine whether the program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements.

### Problem Description Recap
The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). Sasha can rearrange the elements of the array to maximize this beauty.

### Program Analysis

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array is sorted in ascending order. This is a good starting point because it allows us to easily pick the smallest and largest elements.

2. **Rearranging the Array**:
   - The program rearranges the sorted array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This is done using two pointers (`left` and `right`) that start from the beginning and end of the sorted array, respectively. The largest element is added first, followed by the smallest, and so on.
   - This strategy aims to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Calculating the Beauty**:
   - The beauty is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

### Annotations and States

- **Before Function Call**:
  - The input is parsed correctly, and `t` test cases are processed.
  - For each test case, `n` and `arr` are correctly read.

- **Inside `func_1`**:
  - The array is sorted.
  - The rearrangement alternates between the largest and smallest elements.
  - The final `new_arr` is constructed correctly based on the alternating pattern.
  - The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

- **First Test Case**:
  - Input: `[2, 1, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Rearranged: `[3, 1, 2]` or `[1, 3, 2]`
  - Beauty: \(|3-1| + |1-2| = 2\) or \(|1-3| + |3-2| = 2\)
  - Correct.

- **Second Test Case**:
  - Input: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Rearranged: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Beauty: \(|69-69| + |69-69| = 0\)
  - Correct.

- **Third Test Case**:
  - Input: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - Rearranged: `[43, 100, 54, 90, 80]` or similar alternating pattern
  - Beauty: \(|43-100| + |100-54| + |54-90| + |90-80| = 57\)
  - Correct.

- **Fourth Test Case**:
  - Input: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - Rearranged: `[3, 4, 3, 3]` or `[4, 3, 3, 3]`
  - Beauty: \(|3-4| + |4-3| + |3-3| = 1\) or \(|4-3| + |3-3| + |3-3| = 1\)
  - Correct.

- **Fifth Test Case**:
  - Input: `[2, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
  - Rearranged: `[1, 2]`
  - Beauty: \(|1-2| = 1\)
  - Correct.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the strategy of rearranging the array to maximize the beauty by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. The annotations and the behavior of the program align with the problem description and the examples provided.
