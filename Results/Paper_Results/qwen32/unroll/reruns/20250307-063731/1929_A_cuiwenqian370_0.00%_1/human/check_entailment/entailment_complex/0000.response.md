### Reasoning:

The goal of the problem is to maximize the "beauty" of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array in any way. The provided program aims to achieve this by sorting the array and then rearranging it so that the largest and smallest elements alternate.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted in ascending order. This step ensures that we have easy access to both the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Alternating Largest and Smallest Elements**: The program uses a two-pointer technique to rearrange the sorted array such that the largest remaining element is placed before the smallest remaining element, continuing this pattern until all elements are used. This is intended to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.
3. **Calculating the Beauty**: The program then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in this rearranged array.

The approach is sound because alternating the largest and smallest elements maximizes the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is because the difference between the largest and smallest elements will be the largest possible difference, and placing them consecutively will contribute the most to the total beauty.

### Verification with Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `3`, `2 1 3`
   - After sorting: `1 2 3`
   - After rearranging: `3 1 2`
   - Beauty: `(3 - 1) + (2 - 1) = 2 + 1 = 3` (Note: The correct rearrangement is `3 1 2` or `1 3 2` both give a maximum beauty of 3, but the provided program rearranges it as `3 1 2` which gives a beauty of 3-1 + 2-1 = 2)
   
2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `3`, `69 69 69`
   - After sorting: `69 69 69`
   - After rearranging: `69 69 69`
   - Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0`

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `5`, `100 54 80 43 90`
   - After sorting: `43 54 80 90 100`
   - After rearranging: `100 43 90 54 80`
   - Beauty: `(100 - 43) + (90 - 43) + (80 - 54) = 57 + 47 + 26 = 130` (Note: The correct rearrangement is `100 43 90 54 80` or `43 100 54 90 80` both give a maximum beauty of 130, but the provided program rearranges it as `100 43 90 54 80` which gives a beauty of 100-43 + 90-43 + 80-54 = 57 + 47 + 26 = 130 but the expected output is 57 which is incorrect)

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `4`, `3 4 3 3`
   - After sorting: `3 3 3 4`
   - After rearranging: `4 3 3 3`
   - Beauty: `(4 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1`

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `2`, `2 1`
   - After sorting: `1 2`
   - After rearranging: `2 1`
   - Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty for all test cases. Specifically, in the third test case, the expected output is 57, but the program's output is 130, which indicates an error in the rearrangement or calculation logic.

**Correctness: False**
