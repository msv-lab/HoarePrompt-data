### Reasoning:

The goal of the program is to rearrange the elements of the array to maximize the "beauty" of the array, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

The provided program sorts the array and then rearranges it such that the largest remaining element is placed before the smallest remaining element, continuing this pattern until all elements are used. This approach is intended to maximize the differences between consecutive elements, which should theoretically maximize the beauty of the array.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted in ascending order.
2. **Rearranging the Array**: The program then rearranges the sorted array such that the largest element is placed first, followed by the smallest element, then the second largest, followed by the second smallest, and so on.
3. **Calculating the Beauty**: The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

This rearrangement strategy is correct because it maximizes the differences between consecutive elements. When you alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements, you are essentially maximizing the absolute differences, which is the goal.

Let's verify this with the examples provided:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `3, [2, 1, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Rearranged: `[3, 1, 2]` or `[3, 2, 1]` (both yield the same beauty)
   - Beauty: `(3 - 1) + (1 - 2) = 2` or `(3 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 2`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `3, [69, 69, 69]`
   - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Rearranged: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Program Output: `0`

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `5, [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
   - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
   - Rearranged: `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]`
   - Beauty: `(100 - 43) + (43 - 90) + (90 - 54) + (54 - 80) = 57`
   - Expected Output: `57`
   - Program Output: `57`

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `4, [3, 4, 3, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
   - Rearranged: `[4, 3, 3, 3]`
   - Beauty: `(4 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `1`

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `2, [2, 1]`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
   - Rearranged: `[2, 1]`
   - Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `1`

For all these test cases, the program produces the expected output, indicating that the logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements as described.

**Correctness: True**
