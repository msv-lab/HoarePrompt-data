Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the list `arr`, and a list `arr` of `n` integers. The function returns `max_beauty`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in a new list `new_arr`.**
