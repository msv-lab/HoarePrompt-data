To determine the output state after the loop finishes, we need to understand what the loop does and how it modifies the state.

The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) and calculates the `max_beauty` by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `new_arr` is rearranged such that the largest remaining element is placed before the smallest remaining element, continuing this pattern until all elements are used.
- `left` is `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2` if `n` is even.
- `right` is `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even.
- `max_beauty` is initialized to `0`.

The loop calculates the `max_beauty` by iterating through `new_arr` and summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Let's consider an example to understand this better. Suppose `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. Then `new_arr` would be `[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]` (largest before smallest, and so on).

The loop would then execute as follows:
- `i = 1`: `max_beauty += abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0])` → `max_beauty += abs(1 - 5)` → `max_beauty = 4`
- `i = 2`: `max_beauty += abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1])` → `max_beauty += abs(4 - 1)` → `max_beauty = 7`
- `i = 3`: `max_beauty += abs(new_arr[3] - new_arr[2])` → `max_beauty += abs(2 - 4)` → `max_beauty = 9`
- `i = 4`: `max_beauty += abs(new_arr[4] - new_arr[3])` → `max_beauty += abs(3 - 2)` → `max_beauty = 10`

After the loop finishes, the `max_beauty` is `10`.

Since the loop modifies only `max_beauty`, and the other variables (`new_arr`, `left`, `right`) are not altered by the loop, the output state would be:

Output State: **new_arr is a list that contains the elements of arr rearranged such that the largest remaining element is placed before the smallest remaining element, continuing this pattern until all elements are used; left is n // 2 + 1 if n is odd, or n // 2 if n is even; right is n // 2 - 1 if n is odd, or n // 2 - 1 if n is even; max_beauty is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in new_arr.**
