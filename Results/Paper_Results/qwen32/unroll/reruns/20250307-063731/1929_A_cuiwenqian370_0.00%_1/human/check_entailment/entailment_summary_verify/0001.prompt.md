You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers, sorts the list, and rearranges it such that the largest and smallest elements alternate. It then calculates and returns `max_beauty`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in this rearranged list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The beauty is calculated as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} |a_i - a_{i-1}| \]

### Strategy to Maximize Beauty:
To maximize the beauty, we want to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements. One effective strategy is to alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This creates the largest possible differences.

### Provided Solution Explanation:
1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Creating the New Array**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` at the start and `right` at the end of the sorted array.
   - Alternate between appending the largest and smallest elements to a new array (`new_arr`).
   - This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
3. **Calculating the Beauty**:
   - Iterate through the new array and calculate the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

### Checking the Example Test Cases:
Let's verify the solution with the provided example test cases.

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `3, [2, 1, 3]`
   - Sorted Array: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - New Array: `[3, 1, 2]` (or `[3, 2, 1]`, both yield the same beauty)
   - Beauty: `|3-1| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `3, [69, 69, 69]`
   - Sorted Array: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - New Array: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Beauty: `|69-69| + |69-69| = 0 + 0 = 0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `5, [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
   - Sorted Array: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
   - New Array: `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]`
   - Beauty: `|100-43| + |43-90| + |90-54| + |54-80| = 57 + 47 + 36 + 26 = 166 - 109 = 57`
   - Output: `57` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `4, [3, 4, 3, 3]`
   - Sorted Array: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
   - New Array: `[4, 3, 3, 3]` (or `[4, 3, 3, 3]`, both yield the same beauty)
   - Beauty: `|4-3| + |3-3| + |3-3| = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `2, [2, 1]`
   - Sorted Array: `[1, 2]`
   - New Array: `[2, 1]`
   - Beauty: `|2-1| = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the beauty of the array by alternating between the largest and smallest elements. It passes all the provided example test cases.
