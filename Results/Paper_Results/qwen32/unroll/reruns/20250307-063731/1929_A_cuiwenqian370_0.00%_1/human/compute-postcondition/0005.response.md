Output State: **`new_arr` is a list that contains the elements of `arr` rearranged such that the largest remaining element is placed before the smallest remaining element, continuing this pattern until all elements are used; `left` is `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2` if `n` is even; `right` is `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even (essentially, `left` and `right` have crossed each other).**

In simpler terms, the `new_arr` list will have the elements of the original `arr` list arranged in a specific order where the largest element comes first, followed by the smallest, then the second largest, the second smallest, and so on. The `left` and `right` pointers will have moved past each other, indicating that the loop has completed its execution.
