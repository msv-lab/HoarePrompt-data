You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers, sorts the list, and rearranges it such that the largest and smallest elements alternate. It then calculates and returns `max_beauty`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in this rearranged list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program follows the problem description correctly and should work for every potential case. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is first sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because the goal is to maximize the beauty, which is the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

2. **Rearranging the Array**: The program then rearranges the sorted array in a specific way: it alternates between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This strategy helps to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Calculating the Beauty**: After rearranging the array, the program calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Let's consider the examples given in the problem description:

- **First Test Case**: For the input `[2, 1, 3]`, the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3]`. The rearranged array is `[1, 3, 2]` or `[3, 1, 2]`. Both arrangements yield a beauty of `2`.
- **Second Test Case**: For the input `[69, 69, 69]`, the sorted array is `[69, 69, 69]`. The rearranged array is `[69, 69, 69]`, and the beauty is `0`.
- **Third Test Case**: For the input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, the sorted array is `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`. The rearranged array can be `[43, 100, 54, 90, 80]`, yielding a beauty of `57`.
- **Fourth Test Case**: For the input `[3, 4, 3, 3]`, the sorted array is `[3, 3, 3, 4]`. The rearranged array can be `[3, 4, 3, 3]` or `[4, 3, 3, 3]`, yielding a beauty of `1`.
- **Fifth Test Case**: For the input `[2, 1]`, the sorted array is `[1, 2]`. The rearranged array is `[1, 2]`, yielding a beauty of `1`.

The program handles all these cases correctly. Additionally, the program's logic is sound for any input within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
