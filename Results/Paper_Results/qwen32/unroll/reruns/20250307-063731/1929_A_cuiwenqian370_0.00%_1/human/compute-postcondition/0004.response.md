The only variables in the loop head are `left` and `right`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `right`. If `left` is less than or equal to `right`, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `left` is 0, and `right` is `n - 1`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `right` will be at least 1 (since `n` is at least 2). Therefore, `left` (which is 0) will always be less than or equal to `right` (which is at least 1).

No adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time because the initial conditions already satisfy the loop's condition (`left <= right`).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0; `right` is `n - 1`.**
