The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `left`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0**.
