Output State: **`new_arr` is a list that contains the elements of `arr` rearranged such that the largest remaining element is placed before the smallest remaining element, continuing this pattern until all elements are used; `left` is `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2` if `n` is even; `right` is `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even; `max_beauty` is 0.**

In simpler terms, the list `new_arr` remains rearranged as described, the values of `left` and `right` remain the same as per the initial conditions, and a new variable `max_beauty` is introduced with a value of 0.
