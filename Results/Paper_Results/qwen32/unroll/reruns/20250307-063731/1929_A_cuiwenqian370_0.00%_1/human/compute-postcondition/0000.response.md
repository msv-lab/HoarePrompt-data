The provided Python code snippet sorts the list `arr`. After sorting, the elements of `arr` will be in non-decreasing order. The values of `t`, `n`, and the individual elements of `arr` before sorting are preserved in their constraints but are now ordered within `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
