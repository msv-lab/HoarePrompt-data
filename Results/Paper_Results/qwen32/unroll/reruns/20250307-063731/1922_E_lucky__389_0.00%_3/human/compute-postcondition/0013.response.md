The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly as per the provided function definition. However, based on the context, it is implied that the function will process `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, it will process an integer `X` such that `X` is between 2 and 10^18. The function will return a result for each test case based on the value of `X`.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `X` (2 <= X <= 10^18). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the value of `X`.**
