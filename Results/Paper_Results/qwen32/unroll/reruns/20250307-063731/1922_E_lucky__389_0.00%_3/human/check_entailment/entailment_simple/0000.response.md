### Reasoning:

The provided code is intended to solve the problem of finding an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation of the given code that make it incorrect.

1. **Function Definition and Execution**:
   - The function `func_1()` is supposed to handle each test case, but it is not defined correctly within the given context. The main loop in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block should call `func_1()` with the appropriate arguments, but it currently does not.

2. **Calculation of Subsequence Lengths**:
   - The code attempts to decompose `X - 1` into a sum of powers of 2, which is a common technique for constructing arrays with a specific number of increasing subsequences. However, the way it handles the decomposition and constructs the array is flawed.
   - The logic for appending values to `subseq_lens` and constructing `ansv` does not correctly map to the intended array construction. Specifically, the way `subseq_lens` is used to construct `ansv` does not ensure that the resulting array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

3. **Output**:
   - The output format is incorrect. The code prints the length of the array and then prints the elements of the array, but it does not handle the case where no such array exists (i.e., when `X` cannot be achieved with an array of length at most 200).

### Example Issues:
- For `X = 2`, the correct output should be an array of length 1, such as `[0]`, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element.
- For `X = 5`, the correct output could be an array of length 3, such as `[0, 1, 0]`, which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences.
- For `X = 13`, the correct output could be an array of length 5, such as `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]`, which has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
- For `X = 37`, the correct output could be an array of length 7, such as `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]`, which has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

However, the provided code does not correctly generate these arrays or handle the cases where no such array exists.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the logic and implementation, the provided program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
