To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is unchanged (its value is not specified, but it's not used in the print statement).
- `x` is 0 (its value is not used in the print statement).
- `subseq_lens` is a list containing [3, 2] (its value is not used in the print statement).
- `mx` is 3 (its value is not used in the print statement).
- `ansv` is a list containing [0, 1, 2, 2].

### Print Statement:
```python
print(len(ansv))
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is asking for the length of the list `ansv`. Based on the initial state, `ansv` is explicitly defined as a list with four elements: [0, 1, 2, 2].

The length of a list is the number of elements it contains. Therefore, the length of `ansv` is 4.

### Output:
Output: **4**
