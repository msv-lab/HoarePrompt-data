### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by finding an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to achieve this. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Algorithm**: The algorithm used in the code does not guarantee that the array produced will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The code seems to be trying to decompose `X-1` into powers of 2 and then constructing an array based on these powers. However, the relationship between the decomposition and the increasing subsequences is not correctly mapped.

2. **Subsequence Counting**: The number of increasing subsequences in an array is influenced by the specific values and their order. The current approach does not ensure that the constructed array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. It relies on a flawed method of decomposing `X-1` and using the decomposition to build the array.

3. **Example Verification**: The provided examples in the problem statement are not correctly produced by the given code. For instance, the output for `X = 5` is `0 1 0`, which does not have exactly 5 increasing subsequences. The correct output for `X = 5` could be something like `0 1 2 0`, which has the subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[2]`, `[0, 1]`, `[0, 2]`, `[1, 2]`, `[0, 1, 2]` (total 8, not 5). However, a correct array could be `0 1 0 2` which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[2]`, `[0, 1]`.

4. **Output State**: The comments in the code suggest that the output state for `X = 5` should be `[0, 1, 2, 2]`, which is incorrect as explained above.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem of finding an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic and the method used to construct the array are flawed.

### Correctness: **False**
