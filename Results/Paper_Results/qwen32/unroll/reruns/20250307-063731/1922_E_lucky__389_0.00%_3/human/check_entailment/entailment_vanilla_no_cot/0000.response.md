Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly generate an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences. The approach taken in the program does not guarantee that the generated array will have the correct number of increasing subsequences. The logic for constructing the array based on powers of 2 and appending indices does not align with the problem's requirements.

The problem requires constructing an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, which is a more complex task than what the provided program attempts to do. The program seems to be trying to construct the array based on the binary representation of X, but it does not correctly map this to the number of increasing subsequences in the array.

To solve this problem correctly, one needs to understand the combinatorial properties of increasing subsequences and how to construct an array that satisfies the given condition. The approach typically involves using a combination of numbers in the array to create the desired number of subsequences, which the provided program does not achieve.
