The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `x`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18. The execution of the code will change the value of `x` to the integer input provided, but `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `x` is an input integer.**
