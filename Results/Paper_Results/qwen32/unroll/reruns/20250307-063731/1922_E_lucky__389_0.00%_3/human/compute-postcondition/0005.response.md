Let's analyze the given loop and determine the final state of the variables after the loop has finished executing.

### Initial State:
- `t`: An integer between 1 and 1000 (though `t` is not used in the loop, it remains unchanged).
- `x`: The input integer minus 1.
- `subseq_lens`: An empty list.
- `mx`: 0.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Outer While Loop (`while x != 0`)**: This loop continues as long as `x` is not zero.
2. **Inner While Loop (`while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`)**: This loop finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x + 1`. The variable `i` is incremented until `2 ** (i + 1)` exceeds `x + 1`.
3. **Condition Check (`if i == 0`)**: If `i` is 0, it means `x` is less than 1, and the loop breaks.
4. **Else Block**: If `i` is not 0, the following operations are performed:
   - `subseq_lens.append(i)`: The value of `i` is appended to the list `subseq_lens`.
   - `x -= 2 ** i - 1`: The value of `x` is reduced by `2 ** i - 1`.
   - `mx = max(mx, i)`: The variable `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `i`.

### Loop Execution:
The loop essentially decomposes `x` into a sum of numbers of the form `2^i - 1` (where `i` is a positive integer), and it keeps track of the largest such `i` encountered.

### Output State:
- `t`: Remains unchanged as per the problem statement.
- `x`: Becomes 0 after the loop finishes.
- `subseq_lens`: A list containing the values of `i` for each step of the decomposition.
- `mx`: The maximum value of `i` encountered during the decomposition.

### Example:
Let's consider an example where the input integer is 10, so `x` is 9 initially.
- First iteration: `i` becomes 3 (since `2^4` is 16 which is greater than 10, but `2^3` is 8 which is less than or equal to 10). `x` becomes 9 - (2^3 - 1) = 2. `mx` becomes 3.
- Second iteration: `i` becomes 2 (since `2^3` is 8 which is greater than 3, but `2^2` is 4 which is less than or equal to 3). `x` becomes 2 - (2^2 - 1) = 0. `mx` remains 3.
- The loop terminates since `x` is now 0.

**Output State:** `t` is unchanged, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is [3, 2], and `mx` is 3.

Output State: **t is unchanged, x is 0, subseq_lens is [3, 2], and mx is 3.**

In natural language, the output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the variable `x` is reduced to 0, the list `subseq_lens` contains the sequence of `i` values used in the decomposition, and `mx` holds the maximum `i` value encountered during the process. The variable `t` remains unchanged.
