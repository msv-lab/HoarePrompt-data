Correctness: **False**

Explanation: Upon reviewing the provided program, there are several issues that suggest it does not always produce the correct output as per the problem description.

1. **Function Call Error**: The `func_1()` function is called inside the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, but it is not defined before the call. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Logic for Generating Subsequences**: The logic for generating the array to produce exactly `X` increasing subsequences is flawed. The code attempts to decompose `X-1` into a sum of powers of 2, which is a step towards constructing the array, but it does not correctly map these powers to an array that will yield the exact number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Array Construction**: The constructed array `ansv` does not necessarily ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`. For example, the code may not handle cases where `X` is a large number that cannot be represented by a simple sum of powers of 2 in a way that constructs a valid array.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, when `X` is a large number, the algorithm might not correctly generate an array of length at most 200. Additionally, the program does not check if the generated array indeed has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, which is a critical requirement.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
37
```

**Expected Output:**
```
7
-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
```

The given program might not generate this output correctly, or it might generate an output that does not have exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

Given these points, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all possible inputs within the specified constraints. Therefore, the correctness is False.
