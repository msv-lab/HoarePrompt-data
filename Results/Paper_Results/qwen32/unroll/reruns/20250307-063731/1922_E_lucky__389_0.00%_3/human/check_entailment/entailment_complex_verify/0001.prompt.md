You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.

            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: `t` is unchanged, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is [3, 2], and `mx` is 3.
    #
    #Output State:
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: t is unchanged, x is 0, subseq_lens is [3, 2], mx is 3, ansv is [0, 1, 2, 2]
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 4
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: t is unchanged, x is 0, subseq_lens is [3, 2], mx is 3, ansv is [0, 1, 2, 2]
    print()
    #This is printed: (newline)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `X` from the input, processes it to determine a sequence of subsequence lengths, and outputs the length of this sequence followed by the sequence itself. The sequence is derived based on the binary representation and decomposition of `X-1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it's correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences. The number of increasing subsequences for an array can be influenced by the structure of the array. Specifically, an array of the form [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, ...] can generate a large number of increasing subsequences. The number of increasing subsequences for such an array can be calculated based on the number of 1s and 0s.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to construct an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of what the program does:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `x` to `X - 1` because it considers the empty subsequence as one of the increasing subsequences.
2. **Subsequence Length Calculation**: The program tries to decompose `x` into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1 (i.e., `2^i - 1`). The idea is that each `2^i - 1` corresponds to a certain pattern in the array that contributes to the number of increasing subsequences.
3. **Array Construction**: Based on the calculated subsequence lengths, the program constructs an array `ansv` that is supposed to have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Correctness of Subsequence Counting**: The program decomposes `x` into powers of 2 minus 1, which is a valid approach to generate the required number of increasing subsequences.
2. **Array Construction**: The array `ansv` is constructed based on the subsequence lengths, but the construction logic might not be entirely correct or complete.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases, such as when `X` is small or large.

### Issues in the Program:
The provided program has several issues:
- The array construction logic does not correctly map the subsequence lengths to the desired array.
- The program does not handle all cases correctly, especially when `X` is large or small.
- The program does not ensure that the constructed array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the program, it does not correctly generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
