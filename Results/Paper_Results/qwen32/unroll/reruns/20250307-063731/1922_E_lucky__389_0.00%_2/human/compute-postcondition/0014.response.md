Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the input, computes a sequence based on the powers of 2 that can be subtracted from `X` until `X` becomes zero, and then outputs the length and the elements of this sequence. The sequence is constructed by first including all integers from 0 to the maximum power of 2 used minus one, followed by the powers of 2 used in the sequence, excluding the first one.**
