You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the input, computes a sequence based on the powers of 2 that can be subtracted from `X` until `X` becomes zero, and then outputs the length and the elements of this sequence. The sequence is constructed by first including all integers from 0 to the maximum power of 2 used minus one, followed by the powers of 2 used in the sequence, excluding the first one.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find an array of integers such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. If it's not possible, we should output `-1`. The array can have a length of at most 200, and its elements should be within the range of \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

### Program Analysis:
The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` which handles the logic for finding the array.

#### Inside `func_1()`:
1. Reads the integer `X`.
2. Decrements `X` by 1 (since we are looking for `X - 1` subsequences excluding the empty subsequence).
3. Initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store lengths of increasing subsequences.
4. Initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum length of subsequences found.
5. Enters a while loop that continues until `x` becomes 0.
   - Inside the loop, it finds the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
   - If `i` (the exponent) is not 0, it appends `i` to `subseq_lens`, subtracts `2^i - 1` from `x`, and updates `mx` if `i` is greater than the current `mx`.
6. After the loop, it creates a list `ansv` containing integers from `0` to `mx-1`.
7. It then appends each element from `subseq_lens` (starting from the second element) to `ansv`.
8. Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic for Constructing the Array**: The program constructs the array based on the lengths of increasing subsequences but does not ensure that the array itself has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic for constructing `ansv` does not directly map to creating an array with the required number of increasing subsequences.
2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where it is impossible to construct such an array (e.g., very large `X` values that cannot be represented by a combination of increasing subsequences of a reasonable length).
3. **Output Format**: The program outputs the array elements separated by spaces, which is correct, but it does not handle the case where the array length exceeds 200.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the constructed array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic for constructing the array needs to be re-evaluated to meet the problem requirements.
