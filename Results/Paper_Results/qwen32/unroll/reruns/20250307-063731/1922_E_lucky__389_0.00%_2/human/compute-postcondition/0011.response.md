To determine the output state after the execution of the loop, let's break down the given information and the loop behavior.

### Initial State:
- `x` remains 0.
- `subseq_lens` remains unchanged.
- `mx` remains unchanged.
- `ansv` will now include its original elements (0 to `mx - 1`) followed by the elements of `subseq_lens` starting from the second element.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(len(ansv)):
    print(ansv[i], end=' ')
```

### Explanation:
The loop iterates over each element in the `ansv` list and prints it, separated by a space. The loop does not modify any variables outside its body, and it does not change the `ansv` list itself.

### Output State:
Since the loop only prints the elements of `ansv` and does not modify any variables, the state of `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx` remains unchanged. The `ansv` list also remains unchanged in terms of its values and structure.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` remains 0. `subseq_lens` remains unchanged. `mx` remains unchanged. `ansv` remains unchanged.**
