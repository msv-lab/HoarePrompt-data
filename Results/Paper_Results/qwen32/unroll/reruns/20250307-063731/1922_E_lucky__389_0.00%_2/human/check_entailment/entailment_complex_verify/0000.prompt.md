You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.

            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the powers of 2 used, and `mx` is the maximum value in `subseq_lens`.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: - `x` remains 0.
    #- `subseq_lens` remains unchanged.
    #- `mx` remains unchanged.
    #- `ansv` will now include its original elements (0 to `mx - 1`) followed by the elements of `subseq_lens` starting from the second element.
    #
    #Given the format, the output state is:
    #
    #Output State:
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: mx + len(subseq_lens) - 1 (where mx is the original length of ansv and len(subseq_lens) is the length of the subseq_lens list)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `x` remains 0. `subseq_lens` remains unchanged. `mx` remains unchanged. `ansv` remains unchanged.
    print()
    #This is printed: (newline)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the input, computes a sequence based on the powers of 2 that can be subtracted from `X` until `X` becomes zero, and then outputs the length and the elements of this sequence. The sequence is constructed by first including all integers from 0 to the maximum power of 2 used minus one, followed by the powers of 2 used in the sequence, excluding the first one.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program seems to be attempting to construct an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, but it does not correctly compute or account for all possible increasing subsequences.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

For the input `X = 5`, the program should output an array that has exactly 5 increasing subsequences. One possible correct output for `X = 5` could be:
```
3
0 1 0
```
This array has the following increasing subsequences:
1. []
2. [0]
3. [1]
4. [0, 1]
5. [0, 1, 0]

However, the provided program does not correctly generate such an array. For `X = 5`, the program might output something like:
```
2
0 1
```
This array has only 4 increasing subsequences:
1. []
2. [0]
3. [1]
4. [0, 1]

Thus, the program is not generating the correct array for all values of `X`, and therefore it is incorrect.

To correctly solve this problem, the program would need to accurately compute the number of increasing subsequences for a given array and adjust the array to meet the required number of subsequences. The provided program does not appear to do this correctly for all values of `X`.
