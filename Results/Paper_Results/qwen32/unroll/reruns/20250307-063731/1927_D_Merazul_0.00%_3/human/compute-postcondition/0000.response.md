The provided code snippet is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into multiple integers, and maps them to a tuple of integers. This function is typically used to read multiple integers from a single line of input efficiently.

Given the initial state, the code does not directly affect the values of `n`, `a`, `q`, or the elements of the array `a` or the queries. Instead, it defines a function `R` that can be used later to read input values. Therefore, the output state will reflect this new function definition without changing any of the existing variables.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, it starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array a. This is followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array a. Next, an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5) is given, representing the number of queries. Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, `R` is defined as a lambda function that reads and maps a line of input to a tuple of integers.**
