Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - An integer `n` representing the length of the array.
     - An array `a` of `n` integers.
     - An integer `q` representing the number of queries.
     - `q` queries, each defined by two integers `l` and `r`.
   
2. **Output:**
   - For each query, output two indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` and `l <= i, j <= r`. If no such pair exists, output `-1 -1`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program does not follow the problem requirements at all. Here is the breakdown of the issues:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` correctly.
   - However, it then reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` incorrectly.
     - Instead of reading `n` and then the array `a` of `n` integers, it reads `k` and then two sets `a` and `b` of integers. This is entirely incorrect as per the problem statement.
   - It also reads `q` and the queries incorrectly. Instead of reading `q` and then `q` pairs of `(l, r)`, it reads `k // 2` elements into `b`.

2. **Logic:**
   - The program attempts to perform some kind of set operations and checks, but these operations do not correspond to the problem requirements.
   - The program tries to determine if certain conditions are met using bitwise operations and prints 'Y' or 'N' based on these conditions, which has nothing to do with finding pairs of indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'Y' or 'N' based on some internal checks, which is not the expected output format. The expected output is either two indices `i` and `j` or `-1 -1`.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect as it does not solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
