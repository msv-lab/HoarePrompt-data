Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, it starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`. This is followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array `a`. Next, an integer `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5) is given, representing the number of queries. Each of the next `q` lines contains two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, `R` is defined as a lambda function that reads and maps a line of input to a tuple of integers. `t` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    *_, k = R()
    a = {*R()}
    b = {*R()}
    f = 1
    m = n = k // 2
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        u = i in a
        v = i in b
        f &= u | v
        m -= u & ~v
        n -= ~u & v
    print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
