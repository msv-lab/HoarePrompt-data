### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description in detail to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given an array `a` of `n` integers and `q` queries.
- Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r` (1-based indexing).
- For each query, we need to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `l <= i <= r`, `l <= j <= r`, and `a[i] != a[j]`.
- If such a pair does not exist, we should output `-1 -1`.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code does not align with the problem description in several ways:

1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
   (t,) = R()
   while t:
       t -= 1
       (*_, k) = R()
       a = {*R()}
       b = {*R()}
   ```
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` correctly.
   - However, the line `(*_, k) = R()` is incorrect for reading the array length `n` and the array `a`.
   - The code reads `a` and `b` as sets, which is not required by the problem. The problem requires processing the array and queries, not sets.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - The code does not read the queries at all. It only processes some sets `a` and `b` which are not defined in the problem.
   - The logic inside the loop (`for i in range(1, k + 1):`) is completely unrelated to the problem. It seems to be checking for the presence of numbers in sets `a` and `b`, which is not what the problem requires.

3. **Output:**
   - The output statement `print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])` is not aligned with the problem's requirement to output pairs of indices or `-1 -1`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not follow the problem description at all. It does not read the queries, does not find pairs of indices in the array that meet the criteria, and does not produce the correct output format.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
