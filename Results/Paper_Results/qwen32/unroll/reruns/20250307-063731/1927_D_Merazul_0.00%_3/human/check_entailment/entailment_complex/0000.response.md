Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The program seems to be checking some condition related to the presence of numbers in two sets, but it does not address the problem of finding two different elements within the specified range of each query.

Here are the key issues with the provided code:
1. The program reads the input but does not process the queries correctly.
2. It uses sets to read the array elements and queries, which loses the order and the multiple occurrences of elements.
3. The logic inside the loop does not match the problem statement. It seems to be checking if certain numbers are present in the sets, but it does not find two different elements within the specified range as required by the problem.
4. The output is 'YES' or 'NO', which is not what the problem expects. The problem requires outputting two indices or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

Given the problem requirements, a correct approach would be to iterate over each query, check the subarray from `l` to `r`, and find two different elements. If found, print their indices; otherwise, print `-1 -1`.

Correctness: **False**
