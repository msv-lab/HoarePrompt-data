Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description. The problem requires finding two indices `i` and `j` within the given range `[l, r]` such that `a_i != a_j` for each query. The program, however, seems to be checking for something entirely different and does not even process the queries as described. It appears to be checking if certain numbers are present in two sets `a` and `b`, which are not defined according to the problem description. The program also does not handle the input and output requirements correctly as specified.

Here is a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then enters a loop to process each test case. However, it does not correctly process the array `a` or the queries.
2. The line `(*_, k) = R()` seems to be incorrectly attempting to read the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself. The correct way to read the array would be `n = next(R())` followed by `a = list(R())`.
3. The program then reads `a` and `b` as sets, which does not align with the problem description. The problem does not require sets; it requires processing the array and queries as specified.
4. The logic inside the loop does not match the problem requirements. It seems to be checking for the presence of numbers in sets `a` and `b` and does not find pairs of indices in the array `a` that meet the criteria.
5. The output of the program is not formatted according to the problem description. It should output pairs of indices or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists, but the program outputs something entirely different.

Given these issues, the program is clearly incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
