You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, it starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array a. This is followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array a. Next, an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5) is given, representing the number of queries. Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
We are given an array `a` of `n` integers and `q` queries. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r`, and for each query, we need to find two indices `i` and `j` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a[i] != a[j]`. If no such pair exists, we should output `-1 -1`.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program does not seem to correctly implement the solution to the problem. Here is a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the array `a`, the number of queries `q`, and then the queries themselves.
   
2. **Error in Logic:**
   - The program uses a set `a` to store the elements of the array, which means it loses the original order and duplicates are removed. This is incorrect because we need to consider the elements in the specific range `[l, r]` for each query.
   - The program then reads `k` (which is `q` in the problem statement) and tries to process it in a way that doesn't align with the problem requirements. It uses two sets `a` and `b` and performs operations that do not correspond to finding pairs of different elements within the specified range.
   - The program does not correctly process each query to find the required indices `i` and `j` within the specified range `[l, r]`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'YNEOS' based on some conditions that do not correspond to the problem's requirements. It does not output the correct indices `i` and `j` or `-1 -1` when no such pair exists.

#### Correct Approach:
- For each query, we need to examine the elements within the range `[l, r]` and find two different elements.
- This can be done by iterating through the elements in the range and checking for at least two distinct values.
- If we find two distinct values, we can output their indices. If not, we output `-1 -1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It misinterprets the input and uses logic that does not align with the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
