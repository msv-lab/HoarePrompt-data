Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers which are the elements of the array. Then, it receives an integer `q` representing the number of queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r` representing the boundaries of the query. The function processes these queries and returns the sum of the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` for each query.**
