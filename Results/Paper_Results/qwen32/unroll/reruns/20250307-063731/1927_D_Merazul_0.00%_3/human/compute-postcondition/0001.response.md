The given code snippet reads a single integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The variables `n`, `a`, `q`, and the queries `l` and `r` are not yet defined or modified in this snippet. The function `R` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input and maps it to a tuple of integers, but it is not used in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, it starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`. This is followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array `a`. Next, an integer `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5) is given, representing the number of queries. Each of the next `q` lines contains two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, `R` is defined as a lambda function that reads and maps a line of input to a tuple of integers. `t` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input.**
