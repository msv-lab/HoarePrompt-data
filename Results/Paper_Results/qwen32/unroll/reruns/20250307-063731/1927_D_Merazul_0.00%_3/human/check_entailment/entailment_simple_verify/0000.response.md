### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**:
   - The line `(*_, k) = R()` is attempting to read the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself, which is incorrect. The correct way to read the array would be `n = next(R())` followed by `a = list(R())`.
   - The program reads `a` and `b` as sets, which does not align with the problem description. The problem requires processing the array and queries as specified, not working with sets.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic inside the loop does not match the problem requirements. It seems to be checking for the presence of numbers in sets `a` and `b` and does not find pairs of indices in the array `a` that meet the criteria.
   - The program does not process the queries at all. It does not even use the `l` and `r` values provided in the queries to check for pairs of indices within the specified range.

3. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The output of the program is not formatted according to the problem description. It should output pairs of indices or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists, but the program outputs something entirely different (`'Y'` or `'NO'` strings).

Given these issues, the program is clearly incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
