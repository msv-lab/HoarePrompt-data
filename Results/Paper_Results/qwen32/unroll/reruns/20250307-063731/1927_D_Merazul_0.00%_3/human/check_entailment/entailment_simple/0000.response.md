### Reasoning:

The provided code is intended to solve a problem where, for each query, we need to find two different elements within a specified subarray of an array. However, the code provided does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Input Parsing:**
   - The code uses `*_, k = R()`, which is not correctly parsing the input. The variable `k` is supposed to be the number of elements in the array `a`, but this line does not correctly assign `k` to the length of the array. Instead, it appears to be trying to assign the last value of the input line to `k`, which is incorrect.
   - The array `a` is supposed to be a list of integers, but the code incorrectly converts it to a set using `a = {*R()}`. This loses the order of elements and does not allow for the correct indexing required by the queries.
   - The next line `b = {*R()}` is also incorrect. The variable `b` is not defined in the problem description and seems to be an attempt to read the number of queries, but it's not used correctly. The number of queries should be read directly, not as a set.

2. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The code uses a loop that iterates from 1 to `k`, but `k` is not correctly defined. Additionally, the logic inside the loop (`f &= u | v`, `m -= u & ~v`, `n -= ~u & v`) does not correspond to finding two different elements in the subarray. These operations appear to be related to some other problem, possibly checking if certain numbers are present in two sets, but they do not solve the problem at hand.
   - The final print statement `print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])` is also incorrect. It seems to be trying to print 'Y' or 'NO' based on some condition, but this is not relevant to the problem of finding two different elements in a subarray.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Read the number of test cases.
- For each test case, read the array `a` and the number of queries `q`.
- For each query, check the subarray `a[l-1:r]` (since the problem specifies 1-based indexing) to find two different elements.
- If such elements exist, print their indices. If not, print `-1 -1`.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the code is:

**Correctness: False**
