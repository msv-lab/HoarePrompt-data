Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly maximize the product of the two numbers `x` and `y`. The logic in the `func_1` function attempts to swap digits based on a fixed condition related to the midpoint of the string, which does not guarantee the maximum product.

Let's consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
1
123
321
```

**Expected Output:**
To maximize the product, we should aim to make both numbers as large as possible. The optimal solution would be to swap the digits to get:
```
321
321
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program's logic will result in:
```
321
123
```

This is not optimal because `321 * 123 < 321 * 321`.

The program's logic of swapping the first half of the digits to be the maximum and the second half to be the minimum does not always lead to the maximum product. A more optimal approach would involve sorting the digits of both numbers and then greedily assigning the largest available digits to maximize the product.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all cases optimally.
