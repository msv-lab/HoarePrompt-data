You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program aims to maximize the product of two integers, `x` and `y`, by swapping corresponding digits between them. The strategy implemented in the program is not optimal for maximizing the product. Let's break down the logic and see why it might not work correctly:

1. The program reads the input values for `x` and `y` as strings and converts them into lists of characters.
2. It then iterates over the indices of these lists.
3. For the first half of the digits (up to the middle index), it swaps the digits to make the larger digit in each pair belong to `x` and the smaller digit to `y`.
4. For the second half of the digits, it again swaps the digits but this time to make the smaller digit in each pair belong to `x` and the larger digit to `y`.
5. Finally, it prints the modified `x` and `y`.

However, this strategy does not guarantee that the product of `x` and `y` will be maximized. The optimal strategy involves comparing corresponding digits and making swaps that maximize the product, which is a more complex task than simply swapping based on the position in the number.

For example, consider the test case:
```
x = 3516
y = 3982
```
The program will output:
```
3912
3586
```
But a better solution would be:
```
3986
3512
```
This is because the product `3986 * 3512` is greater than `3912 * 3586`.

The provided program does not implement the correct logic to always achieve the maximum product, so it is incorrect.
