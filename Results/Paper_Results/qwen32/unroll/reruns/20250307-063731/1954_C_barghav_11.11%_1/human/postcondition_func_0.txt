The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `y` of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. It rearranges the digits such that in the first half of the numbers, the larger digit from each position is placed in `x` and the smaller in `y`, and in the second half, the smaller digit from each position is placed in `x` and the larger in `y`. It then prints the rearranged `x` and `y` on separate lines.
