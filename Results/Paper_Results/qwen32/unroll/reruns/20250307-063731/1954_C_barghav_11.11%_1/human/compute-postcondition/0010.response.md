Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive), `x` (an integer between 1 and 10^100 inclusive consisting only of digits from 1 to 9), and `y` (an integer between 1 and 10^100 inclusive consisting only of digits from 1 to 9). Both `x` and `y` are of the same length. The function returns a value based on the comparison or some operation involving `x` and `y` for each of the `t` test cases.**
