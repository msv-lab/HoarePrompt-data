To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to analyze the loop and understand its behavior.

The given loop is:
```python
for i in range(len(b)):
    print(b[i], end='')
```

This loop iterates over each element in the list `b` and prints it without adding any space or newline character between the elements (due to `end=''`).

Given that the initial state pertains to the sequence of digits in `a` after rearrangement, and since `a` is not used in the loop, it does not affect the output. The output will solely depend on the contents of `b`.

Let's assume `b` contains some sequence of digits or characters. For the sake of this explanation, let's assume `b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The loop will print each element in `b` in sequence.

Therefore, the output of the loop will be: `12345`.

Output State: **12345**.

If `b` had a different sequence, the output would reflect that sequence. For example, if `b = ['a', 'b', 'c']`, the output would be: `abc`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact contents of `b`, the output state is dependent on `b`. However, based on the general understanding and the format required, if we assume `b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` for demonstration:

Output State: **12345**.
