You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case includes:
     - Two integers `n` and `k`.
     - An array `a` of length `2n` where each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, two lines:
     - The first line contains `2k` integers forming a subset `l` of the first `n` elements of `a`.
     - The second line contains `2k` integers forming a subset `r` of the last `n` elements of `a`.
     - The bitwise XOR of elements in `l` should equal the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

3. **Constraints:**
   - `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`
   - `2 ≤ n ≤ 50000`
   - `1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋`
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `50000`.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the program step by step to see if it meets the requirements:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes `l` and `r` as arrays of length `n` filled with zeros.
   - `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are initialized to `0`.
   - `res` is initialized as an empty list.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of each number in the first `n` elements of `a` and stores it in `l`.
   - Similarly, it counts the occurrences of each number in the last `n` elements of `a` and stores it in `r`.

3. **Building Subset `l`:**
   - The program then iterates over the first `n` elements of `a`:
     - If an element appears exactly twice in the first `n` elements, it adds the element twice to the output for `l` and increments `ul` by `2`.
     - If `ul` reaches `2k`, it breaks out of the loop.

4. **Building Subset `r`:**
   - If `ul` is less than `2k`, the program continues to iterate over the first `n` elements of `a`:
     - If an element appears exactly once in the first `n` elements, it adds the element to the output for `l` and appends it to the `res` list.
     - If `re` reaches `k`, it breaks out of the loop.
   - The program then prints the elements in `res` for the second line of output.

5. **Ensuring Equal XOR:**
   - The program checks if `ul` is not equal to `ur`:
     - If so, it iterates over the last `n` elements of `a`:
       - If an element appears exactly twice in the last `n` elements, it adds the element twice to the output for `r` and increments `ur` by `2`.
       - If `ul` equals `ur`, it breaks out of the loop.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Subset Construction:**
   - The program does not correctly ensure that `l` and `r` are subsets of the appropriate halves of `a`.
   - The program only checks for elements that appear exactly twice or once in the first `n` elements, which does not guarantee that the elements added to `r` are from the last `n` elements.

2. **XOR Condition:**
   - The program does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.
   - The logic for ensuring equal XOR is flawed and does not account for all possible pairs of subsets.

3. **Output:**
   - The program does not correctly format the output for each test case.
   - The program does not handle the case where `ul` is not equal to `ur` correctly, leading to incomplete or incorrect output.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to ensure that `l` and `r` are subsets of the appropriate halves of `a` and does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
