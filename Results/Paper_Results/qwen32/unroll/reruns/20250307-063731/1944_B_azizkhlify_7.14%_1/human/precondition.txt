t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50,000, and an integer k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The second element of each tuple is a list a of 2n integers, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 50,000.
