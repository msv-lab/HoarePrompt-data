For each test case, the function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It prints pairs of integers based on the value of k. Specifically, it first prints pairs of integers that appear twice in the first half of the list until it has printed k pairs. If fewer than k pairs are printed from the first half, it then prints single occurrences of integers from the first half until it has printed a total of 2k integers. Finally, it prints pairs of integers that appear twice in the second half of the list until the number of printed pairs from the first and second halves are equal.
