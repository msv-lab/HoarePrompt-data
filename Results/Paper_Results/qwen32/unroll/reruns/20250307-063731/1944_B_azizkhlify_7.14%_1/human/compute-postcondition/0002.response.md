Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and an integer `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.**
