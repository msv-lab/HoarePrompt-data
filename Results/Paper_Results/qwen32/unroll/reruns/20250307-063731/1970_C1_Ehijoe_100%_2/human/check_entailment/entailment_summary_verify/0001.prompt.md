You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

- Function Summary: 
The function determines the winner of a game played on a tree with exactly two leaves. Given the number of nodes `n`, a list of edges representing the tree, and a starting node `u_1`, it calculates the path between the two leaves and checks the distance from the starting node to each leaf. If either distance is odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins. The function prints the name of the winner.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a tree with exactly two leaves, which can be treated as a linear structure (array) for this specific case. The game is played in rounds where a stone is placed on a node, and players take turns moving the stone to an adjacent inactive node until no moves are left. The player who cannot make a move loses. The goal is to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

### Key Observations

1. **Tree Structure**: The tree has exactly two leaves, making it a linear sequence of nodes.
2. **Game Dynamics**: The game is essentially a turn-based game on a line where the stone moves from one node to an adjacent one.
3. **Winning Strategy**: The player who starts on an odd-indexed position (considering the stone's starting position as 0-based) will win if the number of moves available is odd. Conversely, if the number of moves is even, the second player will win.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the program step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` are read.
   - The edges of the tree are read and stored in a dictionary `nodes` where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors.
   
2. **Identifying Leaves**:
   - The leaves of the tree are identified by finding nodes with only one neighbor.

3. **Constructing the Linear Structure**:
   - The tree is traversed from one leaf to the other to construct a linear representation of the tree in the `tree` list.

4. **Determining Moves**:
   - The starting position of the stone is read.
   - The index of the starting position in the `tree` list is found.
   - The number of moves available to the player is calculated as `idx` (distance from the start to the first leaf) and `n - idx - 1` (distance from the start to the second leaf).
   
5. **Deciding the Winner**:
   - If either `idx` or `n - idx - 1` is odd, Ron wins.
   - If both are even, Hermione wins.

### Correctness of the Program

The logic in the program correctly identifies the linear structure of the tree and calculates the number of moves available from the starting position. The decision to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of moves is correct. The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
