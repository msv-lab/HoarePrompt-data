The function determines the winner of a game played on a tree with exactly two leaves. Given the number of nodes `n`, a list of edges representing the tree, and a starting node `u_1`, it calculates the path between the two leaves and checks the distance from the starting node to each leaf. If either distance is odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins. The function prints the name of the winner.
