Postcondition: **`tree` is a list containing the path from `s` to `e` followed by `e`, `prev` is `e`, `curr` is `e`, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, and `moves` is a list `[idx, n - idx - 1]`. At least one of the elements in `moves` is odd, or all elements in `moves` are even numbers.**
