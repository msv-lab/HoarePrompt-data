The code snippet `idx = tree.index(start)` searches for the index of the value `start` in the list `tree`. This operation does not change the values of `tree`, `prev`, `curr`, or `start`. It only assigns the index of `start` in `tree` to the variable `idx`.

Output State: **`tree` is a list containing the path from `s` to `e` followed by `e`, `prev` is `e`, `curr` is `e`, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.**
