`start` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `tree`, `prev`, and `curr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tree` is a list containing the path from `s` to `e` followed by `e`, `prev` is `e`, `curr` is `e`, `start` is an input integer**.
