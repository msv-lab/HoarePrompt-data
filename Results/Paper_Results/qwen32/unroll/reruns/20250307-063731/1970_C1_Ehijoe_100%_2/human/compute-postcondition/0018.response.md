The code snippet assigns a list to the variable `moves`. The list contains two elements: `idx` and `n - idx - 1`. The other variables (`tree`, `prev`, `curr`, `start`, and `idx`) are not modified by this code snippet.

Given that `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, and `n` is the length of `tree`, the output state will include the new value of `moves`.

Output State: **`tree` is a list containing the path from `s` to `e` followed by `e`, `prev` is `e`, `curr` is `e`, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list `[idx, n - idx - 1]`.**
