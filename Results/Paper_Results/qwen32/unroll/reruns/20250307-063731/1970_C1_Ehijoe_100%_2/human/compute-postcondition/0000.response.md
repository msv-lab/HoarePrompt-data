The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `t`. Given the initial state, `n` is already defined as an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `t` is defined as an integer such that t = 1. The code snippet does not affect the tree or its properties, nor does it change the starting node for the round. It simply reassigns the values of `n` and `t` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1) where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, representing the starting node for the single round.**
