The code appends `e` to the list `tree`. Therefore, the list `tree` now contains the original path from `s` to `e` plus an additional `e` at the end. The variables `prev` and `curr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tree` is a list containing the path from `s` to `e` followed by `e`, `prev` is `e`, `curr` is `e`**.
