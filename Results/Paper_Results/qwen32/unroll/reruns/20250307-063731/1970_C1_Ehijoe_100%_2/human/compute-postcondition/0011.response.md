The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `s`, which is the first leaf node of the tree. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1) where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, representing the starting node for the single round. `edges` is an empty list. `empty` is True. `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and the value is a list of adjacent nodes forming the tree. `ends` is a list containing the two leaf nodes of the tree. `s` is the first leaf node, `e` is the second leaf node. `tree` is a list containing the first leaf node `s`. `prev` is the first leaf node `s`.**
