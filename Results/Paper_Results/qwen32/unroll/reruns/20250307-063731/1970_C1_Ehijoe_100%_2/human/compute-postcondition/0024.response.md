Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, an integer `t` which is always 1, a list of `n-1` edges representing the connections between nodes in the tree, and a single integer `u_1` representing the starting node for a round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. The function returns the result of a single round starting from node `u_1`.**
