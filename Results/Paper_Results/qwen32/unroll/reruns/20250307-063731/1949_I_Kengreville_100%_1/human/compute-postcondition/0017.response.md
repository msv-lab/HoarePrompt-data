Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` `True` values, `coef` is a list of `n` integers (values depend on `dfs` execution), `tot` is an integer (value depends on `dfs` execution), `bipartite` is a boolean (value depends on `dfs` execution), and `ok` is a boolean. If `ok` is `True`, it indicates that at least one DFS finds a bipartite graph with `tot` not equal to zero. If `ok` is `False`, it indicates that no DFS finds a bipartite graph with `tot` not equal to zero.**
