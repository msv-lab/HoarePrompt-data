The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 because `range(n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. The initial value of `i` is not something we need to set manually before the loop starts, as it will be automatically set to 0 by the `range` function in the first iteration.

Given the information, the only thing that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the value of `n`. It must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of `n` `None` values, `y` is a list of `n` `None` values, `r` is a list of `n` `None` values, `visited` is a list of `n` `False` values, `coef` is a list of `n` `None` values**
