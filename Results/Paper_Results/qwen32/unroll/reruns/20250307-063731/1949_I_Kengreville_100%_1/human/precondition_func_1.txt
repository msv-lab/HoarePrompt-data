i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. The variables x, y, and r are lists of length n, where x[i] and y[i] are the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and r[i] is the positive integer radius of the i-th disk. The variable visited is a list of boolean values of length n indicating whether each disk has been visited. The variable coef is a list of integers of length n used to assign coefficients for bipartite checking. The variable tot is an integer used to accumulate the total of coefficients. The variable bipartite is a boolean used to check if the graph formed by the disks is bipartite.
