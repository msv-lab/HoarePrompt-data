The code snippet `y = [None] * n` reassigns `y` to be a new list with `n` elements, all of which are `None`. The previous list of integers `y` is overwritten by this new list.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of `n` `None` values, `y` is a list of `n` `None` values, and `r` is a list of integers where each element satisfies 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9.**
