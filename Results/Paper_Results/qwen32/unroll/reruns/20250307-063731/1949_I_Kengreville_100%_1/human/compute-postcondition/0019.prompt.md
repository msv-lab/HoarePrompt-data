You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x and y are lists of integers where each element satisfies -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9, and r is a list of integers where each element satisfies 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` `False` values, `coef` is a list of `n` `None` values.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` `True` values, `coef` is a list of `n` integers (values depend on `dfs` execution), `tot` is an integer (value depends on `dfs` execution), `bipartite` is a boolean (value depends on `dfs` execution), `ok` is a boolean (True if at least one DFS finds a bipartite graph with `tot` not equal to zero).
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` `True` values, `coef` is a list of `n` integers (values depend on `dfs` execution), `tot` is an integer (value depends on `dfs` execution), `bipartite` is a boolean (value depends on `dfs` execution), and `ok` is a boolean. If `ok` is `True`, it indicates that at least one DFS finds a bipartite graph with `tot` not equal to zero. If `ok` is `False`, it indicates that no DFS finds a bipartite graph with `tot` not equal to zero.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 1000), `x` (a list of integers where each element is between -10^9 and 10^9), `y` (a list of integers where each element is between -10^9 and 10^9), and `r` (a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9). The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value or logic is not provided in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
