The code snippet assigns `False` to the variable `ok`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` `False` values, `coef` is a list of `n` `None` values, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.**
