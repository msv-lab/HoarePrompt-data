The function reads an integer `n` and three lists `x`, `y`, and `r` of length `n` from the input. It then determines if there exists at least one connected component in the graph represented by these lists that is bipartite and has a non-zero total weight (where weights are derived from the `r` list). If such a component exists, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
