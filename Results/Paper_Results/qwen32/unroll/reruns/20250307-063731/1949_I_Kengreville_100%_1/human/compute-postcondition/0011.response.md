The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range it iterates over, which is `n`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is the value of `n`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
