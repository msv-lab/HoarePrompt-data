The code snippet `x = [None] * n` reassigns the list `x` to be a new list containing `n` elements, each of which is `None`. The values of `n`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of `n` `None` values, `y` is a list of integers where each element satisfies -10^9 <= y[i] <= 10^9, and `r` is a list of integers where each element satisfies 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9.**
