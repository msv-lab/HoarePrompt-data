The code snippet `r = [None] * n` assigns `r` to be a list of `n` `None` values. This changes the previous value of `r`, which was a list of integers where each element satisfies `1 <= r[i] <= 10^9`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of `n` `None` values, `y` is a list of `n` `None` values, and `r` is a list of `n` `None` values.**
