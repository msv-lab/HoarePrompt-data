The given initial state describes several variables and their properties, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply `print('YES')`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It directly prints the string 'YES'.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Print Statement**: The print statement is `print('YES')`.
2. **Determine the Output**: The string 'YES' is explicitly provided in the print statement and does not depend on any variable values or computations within the code snippet.

Based on the provided information and the code snippet, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
