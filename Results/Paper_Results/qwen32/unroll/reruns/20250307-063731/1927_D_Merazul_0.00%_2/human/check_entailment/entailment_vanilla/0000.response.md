### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to process multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an array `a` and a series of queries. Each query asks if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` within a specified range `[l, r]` such that the elements at these indices are different.

The provided code, however, does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` correctly.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` correctly.
   - However, it then reads the number of queries `q` and the queries themselves incorrectly. The line `(*_, k) = R()` is not reading the number of queries as intended. Instead, it seems to be trying to read the entire line as a single integer `k`, which is incorrect.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - The code attempts to process the queries using sets `a` and `b`. However, the logic is not aligned with the problem requirements.
   - The code uses bitwise operations and set membership checks to determine something, but it does not correctly identify pairs of indices `i` and `j` within the specified range `[l, r]` where `a_i != a_j`.
   - The output `'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]` is not meaningful in the context of the problem. It seems to be attempting to output 'YES' or 'NO', but the problem requires outputting two indices or `-1 -1`.

3. **Output:**
   - The code does not output the required indices `i` and `j` for each query. Instead, it outputs 'YES' or 'NO' based on some incorrect logic.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. It incorrectly reads the input, processes the queries, and outputs the results.

### Correctness: **False**
