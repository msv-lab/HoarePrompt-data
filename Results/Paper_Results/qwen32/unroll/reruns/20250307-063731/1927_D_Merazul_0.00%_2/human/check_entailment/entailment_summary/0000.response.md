Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem requires finding two different indices `i` and `j` within a given range `[l, r]` of the array `a` such that `a[i] != a[j]`. For each query, the program should either output two such indices or indicate that no such pair exists.

However, the provided code does not implement this logic correctly. Instead, it appears to be attempting to determine if certain elements are present in two sets `a` and `b`, and then outputs 'YES' or 'NO' based on some conditions involving the presence or absence of elements in these sets. This is not aligned with the problem requirements.

The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the array `a` and the number of queries `q`. It then reads the queries but does not process them correctly. The logic involving sets `a` and `b` and the variables `m` and `n` does not correspond to the problem's requirements.

The correct approach would involve iterating over each query, checking the elements within the specified range `[l, r]`, and finding a pair of different elements. If such a pair is found, the indices should be printed; otherwise, `-1 -1` should be printed.

Given the mismatch between the provided code and the problem description, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
