Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem described. The code seems to be an attempt to process multiple test cases, but the logic inside the loop does not align with the problem requirements. Specifically:

1. **Input Parsing**: The code is attempting to read inputs but incorrectly. The line `*_, k = R()` is trying to unpack values into `k` but does not correctly parse the array or the number of queries.
2. **Data Structures**: The code uses sets `a` and `b` to store elements of the array and queries, respectively, which is not aligned with the problem requirements. The problem requires checking specific ranges for each query, not just the presence of elements in the entire array.
3. **Logic**: The logic inside the loop is trying to determine something about the presence of elements in sets `a` and `b`, but it does not correctly address the problem of finding two different elements within the specified range for each query.
4. **Output**: The output logic is incorrect. The code is trying to print 'YES' or 'NO', but the problem requires printing the indices `i` and `j` of two different elements within the range or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect for the problem described.

Correctness: **False**
