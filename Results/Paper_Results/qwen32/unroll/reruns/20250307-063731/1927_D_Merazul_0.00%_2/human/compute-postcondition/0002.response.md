In the given `while` loop, the loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `t` is truthy. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered truthy, whereas zero is considered falsy. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be a non-zero integer.

State right before the while loop: `t` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input, representing the number of test cases.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. 

State: **`t` is greater than 0**
