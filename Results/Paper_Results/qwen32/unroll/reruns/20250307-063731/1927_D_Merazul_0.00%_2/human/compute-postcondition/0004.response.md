Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers which are the elements of the array. Then, it includes an integer `q` representing the number of queries, followed by `q` pairs of integers `l` and `r` representing the boundaries of each query. For each query, the function returns the result based on the elements of the array within the specified range `[l, r]`.**
