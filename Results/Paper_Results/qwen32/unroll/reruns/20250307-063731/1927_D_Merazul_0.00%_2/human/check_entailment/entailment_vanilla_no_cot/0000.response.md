Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program seems to be attempting to solve a different problem or is incorrectly implemented for the given problem.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input in a way that does not match the problem description. For example, it reads `(*_, k) = R()` which does not correctly parse the number of elements `n` in the array and instead seems to be trying to read the number of queries `q` incorrectly.

2. **Data Structures**: The program uses sets `a` and `b` which are not aligned with the problem requirements. It seems to be trying to use sets to find elements but does not correctly handle the array slices defined by `l` and `r` in each query.

3. **Logic**: The logic in the program does not correctly implement the required functionality. It seems to be attempting to use some form of bit manipulation and set operations to determine the existence of different elements within a range, but this approach is not appropriate for the problem.

4. **Output**: The program outputs 'YNEOS' which is not the expected output format. The problem requires outputting two indices `i` and `j` or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        q = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            l -= 1
            r -= 1
            
            found = False
            for i in range(l, r):
                for j in range(i + 1, r + 1):
                    if a[i] != a[j]:
                        results.append(f"{i + 1} {j + 1}")
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            
            if not found:
                results.append("-1 -1")
    
    print("\n".join(results))

func()
```

This corrected version reads the input correctly, processes each test case and each query, and outputs the correct indices or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.
