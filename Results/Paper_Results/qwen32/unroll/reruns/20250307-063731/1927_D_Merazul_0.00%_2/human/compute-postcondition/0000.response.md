Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array a. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) which are the elements of the array a. The following line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of queries. The next q lines each contain two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of each query. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and splits it into a map of integers.**

In simple terms: The input conditions remain the same, with multiple test cases each containing an array and queries. The lambda function `R` is defined to read and split the input into integers.
