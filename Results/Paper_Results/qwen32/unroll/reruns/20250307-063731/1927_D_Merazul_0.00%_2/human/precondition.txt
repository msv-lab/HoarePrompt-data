t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple (n, a, q, queries) where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and queries is a list of q tuples where each tuple (l, r) satisfies 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
