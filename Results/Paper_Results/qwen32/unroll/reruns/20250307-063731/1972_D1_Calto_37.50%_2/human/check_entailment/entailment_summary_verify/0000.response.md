Let's carefully analyze the problem description and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Provided Code Analysis
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.

### Function `func_2` Analysis
The provided code for `func_2` does not seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

- The function iterates over `b` from 1 to `m-1`.
- For each `b`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
- It updates the count `cnt` by adding `x // y + (i > 1)`.
- If `cnt` is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

This logic does not match the problem requirements. The function should iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Verification with Test Cases
Let's verify the provided code with the example test cases given in the problem description.

#### Test Case 1: \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)
- The only pair is \((1, 1)\).
- \(a + b = 2\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\).
- Since 2 is a multiple of 1, the pair \((1, 1)\) should be counted.
- The provided code returns 1, which is correct for this case.

#### Test Case 2: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)
- Valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
- The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to count these pairs.
- The provided code does not return 3 as expected.

### Conclusion
The logic inside `func_2` does not correctly implement the required condition for counting valid pairs \((a, b)\). The provided code does not properly check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each pair \((a, b)\).

### Final Evaluation
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic for all potential cases.

Final: **False**
