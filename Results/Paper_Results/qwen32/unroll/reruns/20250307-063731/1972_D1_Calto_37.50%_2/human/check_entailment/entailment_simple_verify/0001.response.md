### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the provided program to understand why.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.

However, the implementation of `func_2` is incorrect. Here's why:

- The function initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
- It iterates through `i` from 1 to `m-1`.
- For each `i`, it calculates `x` and `y` and updates `cnt` based on these calculations.
- If `cnt` is 0 after the loop, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

The logic in `func_2` does not match the problem's requirement of checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided annotations also do not reflect the correct logic for solving the problem. The annotations suggest that `cnt` is calculated based on a series involving \(n\) and \(i\), but this does not align with the problem's requirement.

#### Correct Implementation:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible values of `a` and `b` and check the given condition:
1. Iterate through all `a` from 1 to `n`.
2. For each `a`, iterate through all `b` from 1 to `m`.
3. For each pair \((a, b)\), calculate \(\gcd(a, b)\).
4. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
5. Count the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.

Since the provided program does not follow this logic, it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final:
Final: **False**
