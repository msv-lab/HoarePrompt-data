Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

The task is to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The provided program has two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) for given `n` and `m`.

Let's review the logic of `func_2`:
- The function iterates over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m-1`.
- For each `b`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
- It then updates the count `cnt` by adding `x // y + (i > 1)`.
- Finally, if `cnt` is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

This logic does not seem to correctly implement the required condition for counting valid pairs (a, b). The logic inside `func_2` does not properly check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for each pair (a, b).

Let's consider a simple test case to verify:
For `n = 1` and `m = 1`, the only pair is (1, 1). Here, `a + b = 2` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`. Since 2 is a multiple of 1, the pair (1, 1) should be counted. The provided program correctly returns 1 for this case.

However, let's consider another test case:
For `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). Here:
- (1, 1): `a + b = 2` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`. 2 is a multiple of 1.
- (2, 1): `a + b = 3` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`. 3 is a multiple of 1.
- (2, 2): `a + b = 4` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 2 * 2 = 4`. 4 is a multiple of 4.

The provided program should return 3 for this case. However, the logic inside `func_2` does not correctly calculate this.

Thus, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
