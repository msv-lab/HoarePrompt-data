### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the provided code and its logic:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - This function is not directly used in `func_2`, so its correctness is not in question here.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - The function initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates over `i` from 1 to `m-1`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
   - It then updates `cnt` by adding `x // y + (i > 1)`.
   - Finally, if `cnt` is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

### Analysis of `func_2(n, m)`:

The logic in `func_2(n, m)` does not directly implement the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it calculates a value based on a series involving `n` and `i`, which does not correspond to the problem's requirements.

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. The logic in the function `func_2` seems to be incorrect and does not match the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program is incorrect based on the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
