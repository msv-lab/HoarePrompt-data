The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `m` is greater than 1 because the `range(1, m)` function generates numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `m`. If `m` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.

Given that `n` and `m` are positive integers and `cnt` is 0, the state of `n` does not affect the execution of the loop. We only need to ensure that `m` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head, so we do not need to set it before the loop starts.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `cnt` is 0**
