Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_2` is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions, but the logic implemented in `func_2` does not match the problem's requirements. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, but it is not used in the `func_2` function.

Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic in `func_2` is not based on the problem's requirements. The problem requires counting pairs (a, b) such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The provided function does not check this condition.

2. **Incorrect Iteration**: The loop in `func_2` iterates from `1` to `m-1`, which is incorrect for the problem. The problem requires iterating over all possible values of `a` from `1` to `n` and `b` from `1` to `m`.

3. **Incorrect Counting**: The counting logic inside the loop is not related to the problem's condition. The program calculates `x` and `y` and then increments `cnt` based on these values, which does not reflect the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) within the given ranges and check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is satisfied. Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:

```python
import math

def count_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    t = int(input[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        m = int(input[index + 1])
        results.append(count_pairs(n, m))
        index += 2
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program correctly counts the number of valid pairs (a, b) for each test case by iterating over all possible pairs and checking the required condition.
