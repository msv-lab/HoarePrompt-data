### Reasoning

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. However, the implementation in `func_2` does not correctly reflect the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to find pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, this function is not used in the provided `func_2`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The logic inside `func_2` does not correctly implement the required condition for counting valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The function iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\) and calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`. It then updates the count `cnt` by adding `x // y + (i > 1)`. This logic does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each pair \((a, b)\).

4. **Verification with Test Cases**:
   - For `n = 1` and `m = 1`, the only pair is \((1, 1)\). The program correctly returns 1.
   - For `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\). The program does not correctly return 3.

5. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations provided describe the state of the program at key points but do not reflect the correct logic needed to solve the problem. The annotations state that `cnt` is the sum of a series involving `n` and `m`, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is correct in stating that the program does not correctly implement the required logic for all potential cases. The logic inside `func_2` does not properly check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each pair \((a, b)\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
