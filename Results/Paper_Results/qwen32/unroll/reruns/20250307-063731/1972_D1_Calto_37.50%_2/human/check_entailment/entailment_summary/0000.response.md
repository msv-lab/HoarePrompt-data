Reasoning:
The provided code and its functions do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the implementation in `func_2` does not align with this logic.

Let's break down why the given code is incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two input integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs (a, b). The function calculates a value `cnt` based on a series involving `n` and `m`, which does not correspond to the problem's requirement. The provided output hints for `func_2` do not match the problem's description either. The function does not use the GCD in any way, nor does it check the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds. This can be done using nested loops and the GCD function, but the provided `func_2` does not do this.

Given the mismatch between the problem's requirements and the provided code, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
