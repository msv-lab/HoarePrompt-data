### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program has two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) for given `n` and `m`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
- It iterates through `i` from 1 to `m-1`.
- For each `i`, it calculates `x` as `n - (i * i - i)` and `y` as `i * i`.
- It updates `cnt` by adding `x // y + (i > 1)`.
- If `cnt` is 0 after the loop, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary states that `func_2` calculates `cnt` as the sum of a series involving `n` and `m`. If `cnt` is 0, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The provided `func_2` does not seem to follow the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:
- The problem requires checking for each pair \((a, b)\) whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The provided `func_2` does not perform this check at all. Instead, it performs some arithmetic operations that do not align with the problem's requirements.

### Correct Implementation:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate through all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n`.
2. For each `a`, iterate through all `b` from 1 to `m`.
3. For each pair \((a, b)\), calculate \(\gcd(a, b)\).
4. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
5. Count the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
