### Reasoning:

The given problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

Let's analyze the provided code to see if it correctly implements this logic.

#### Function `func_1(a, b)`:
This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This part of the code is correct and matches the expected behavior.

#### Function `func_2(n, m)`:
This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`. However, the implementation does not seem to match the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Logic Mismatch**: The provided function `func_2` does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it calculates a value `cnt` based on a series involving `n` and `m`. This series does not correspond to the logic required by the problem.

2. **Series Calculation**: The series \(\sum_{i=2}^{m-1} \left( \frac{n}{i^2} + \frac{1}{i} \right)\) does not inherently relate to the problem of counting pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The function returns `1` if `cnt` is `0`. This does not align with the problem's requirement to count valid pairs.

4. **Overall Implementation**: The overall implementation does not seem to address the problem of counting pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
