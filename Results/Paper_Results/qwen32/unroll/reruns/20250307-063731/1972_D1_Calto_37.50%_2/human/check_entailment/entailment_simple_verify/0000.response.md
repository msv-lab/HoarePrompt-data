### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, this function is not used anywhere in the provided program, making it redundant.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The provided implementation iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\) and calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, then updates the count `cnt` by adding `x // y + (i > 1)`. This logic does not align with the required condition.
   - The annotations provided in the annotated version do not correctly describe the intended logic of the program. The annotations suggest a mathematical series that does not correspond to the problem's requirement.

3. **Verification with Test Cases**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program works for the test case \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\), returning 1, which is correct.
   - However, for the test case \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\), the program does not correctly identify all valid pairs \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\), and hence returns an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem description. The annotations do not provide a correct explanation of the program's intended behavior, and the logic inside `func_2` is flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
