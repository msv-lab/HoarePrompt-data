You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:

    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is the GCD of the initial values of a and b, and b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns a, which is the greatest common divisor of the initial values of a and b, where b is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two input positive integers `a` and `b`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: cnt is the sum of n and the series \(\sum_{i=2}^{m-1} \left( \frac{n}{i^2} + \frac{1}{i} \right)\).
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: cnt is the sum of n and the series \(\sum_{i=2}^{m-1} \left( \frac{n}{i^2} + \frac{1}{i} \right)\), and cnt is not equal to 0.
    return cnt
    #The program returns `cnt` which is the sum of `n` and the series \(\sum_{i=2}^{m-1} \left( \frac{n}{i^2} + \frac{1}{i} \right)\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `m` where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6. It calculates a value `cnt` as the sum of a series involving `n` and `m`. If `cnt` is 0, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns `cnt`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

The task is to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The provided program has two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) for given `n` and `m`.

Let's review the logic of `func_2`:
- The function iterates over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m-1`.
- For each `b`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
- It then updates the count `cnt` by adding `x // y + (i > 1)`.
- Finally, if `cnt` is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

This logic does not seem to correctly implement the required condition for counting valid pairs (a, b). The logic inside `func_2` does not properly check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for each pair (a, b).

Let's consider a simple test case to verify:
For `n = 1` and `m = 1`, the only pair is (1, 1). Here, `a + b = 2` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`. Since 2 is a multiple of 1, the pair (1, 1) should be counted. The provided program correctly returns 1 for this case.

However, let's consider another test case:
For `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). Here:
- (1, 1): `a + b = 2` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`. 2 is a multiple of 1.
- (2, 1): `a + b = 3` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`. 3 is a multiple of 1.
- (2, 2): `a + b = 4` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 2 * 2 = 4`. 4 is a multiple of 4.

The provided program should return 3 for this case. However, the logic inside `func_2` does not correctly calculate this.

Thus, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
