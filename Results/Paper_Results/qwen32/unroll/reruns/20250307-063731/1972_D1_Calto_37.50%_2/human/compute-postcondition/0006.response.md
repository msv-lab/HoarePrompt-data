Output State: **The program returns `cnt` which is the sum of `n` and the series \(\sum_{i=2}^{m-1} \left( \frac{n}{i^2} + \frac{1}{i} \right)\)**

This means that the value returned by the program is `cnt`, which has already been calculated as the sum of `n` and the specified series from the initial state.
