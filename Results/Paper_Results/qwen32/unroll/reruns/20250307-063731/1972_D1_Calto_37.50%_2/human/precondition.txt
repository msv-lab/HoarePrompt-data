n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function is called multiple times with different values of n and m for each test case, where the total number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the sum of all n and m values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^6.
