You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to take two integers, `n` and `k`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= k <= 10^9`. However, based on the function definition provided, it seems there might be a discrepancy as the function is defined to take only one argument `n`. The correct function definition should include `k` as well. Assuming the correct function definition is `def func_1(n, k):`, the precondition would be: `n` and `k` are integers such that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= k <= 10^9`. Additionally, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State: `n` and `k` are integers such that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= k <= 10^9`. Additionally, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`. `n` is not equal to 0.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: `n` is 0, `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `n`.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns 0



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to create a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` such that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers is maximized.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - If `n == 1`, the only possible sequence is `[k]` because there is only one number.
   - If `n > 1`, it uses a helper function `func_1` to determine the highest bit position in `k`.
   - It constructs the sequence as follows:
     - It sets the first element to `2**counter - 1`, where `counter` is the bit position returned by `func_1(k)`. This number will have all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position in `k`.
     - The second element is set to `k - (2**counter - 1)`.
     - The remaining `n-2` elements are set to 0.

3. **Helper Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the position of the highest bit set in `n`.
   - It does this by right-shifting `n` until it becomes zero, counting the number of shifts.

### Correctness Analysis
- **Single Element Case (`n == 1`)**:
  - The program correctly outputs `[k]` because there is only one number in the sequence.
  
- **Multiple Elements Case (`n > 1`)**:
  - The program attempts to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
  - By setting the first element to `2**counter - 1`, it ensures that the first `counter` bits are all set to 1.
  - The second element is set to `k - (2**counter - 1)`, ensuring that the sum of the sequence is `k`.
  - The remaining elements are set to 0, which does not affect the bitwise OR operation.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the program with the given examples:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `1 5`
   - Output: `5`
   - Correct because there is only one element, and it sums to 5.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `2 3`
   - Output: `1 2`
   - Correct because `1 | 2 = 3` in binary is `11`, which has 2 ones.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `2 5`
   - Output: `5 0`
   - Correct because `5 | 0 = 5` in binary is `101`, which has 2 ones.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `6 51`
   - Output: `3 1 1 32 2 12`
   - Correct because `3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 51` in binary is `110011`, which has 4 ones.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and provides a valid sequence for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
