### Reasoning:
The given program is intended to solve the problem by constructing a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

However, there are several issues with the provided program:

1. **Function `func_1` Misuse:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to take only one argument `n`, but it is being called with `k` as its argument. This is incorrect as per the problem statement and the function's intended purpose.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return the highest bit position of `k` (i.e., the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`), but it is currently defined to take `n` as an argument and does not use `k` at all.

2. **Logic Error in Constructing the Sequence:**
   - The program attempts to construct the sequence by setting the first element to `2**counter - 1` and the second element to `k - arr[-1]`, where `counter` is the result of `func_1(k)`. However, this logic is flawed because `func_1` is not correctly defined to compute the highest bit position of `k`.
   - Even if `func_1` were correctly defined, the logic does not ensure that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s. The approach should consider distributing the bits of `k` across the sequence to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR result.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where `k` is a power of 2 correctly. For example, if `k` is a power of 2, the sequence should ideally contain `k` and the rest zeros, but the current logic may not achieve this.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
