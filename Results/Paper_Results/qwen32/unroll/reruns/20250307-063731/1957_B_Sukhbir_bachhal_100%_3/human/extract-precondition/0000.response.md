Precondition: **The function `func_1` is intended to take two integers, `n` and `k`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= k <= 10^9`. However, based on the function definition provided, it seems there might be a discrepancy as the function is defined to take only one argument `n`. The correct function definition should include `k` as well. Assuming the correct function definition is `def func_1(n, k):`, the precondition would be: `n` and `k` are integers such that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= k <= 10^9`. Additionally, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.**
