You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns -1 if `n` is 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` and returns this count minus one.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Let's analyze why this is the case:

The function `func_1` calculates the number of bits required to represent `k` in binary. The program then creates a sequence where one element is `2**counter - 1` (which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`), and another element is `k - (2**counter - 1)`. The rest of the elements are set to 0.

This approach does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. For example, consider the test case:

**Input:**
```
1
2 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 4
```
or
```
4 1
```
Both of these outputs have `1 | 4 = 5` which in binary is `101` and has 2 ones. Another valid output could be:
```
3 2
```
Here, `3 | 2 = 3` which in binary is `11` and has 2 ones. But the program might output:
```
3 2
```
which is correct in terms of sum but not necessarily optimal in terms of maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

However, a more problematic case is:
**Input:**
```
1
3 7
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2 4
```
Here, `1 | 2 | 4 = 7` which in binary is `111` and has 3 ones. The program might output:
```
7 0 0
```
which is correct in terms of sum but not optimal in terms of maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

The program should be designed to distribute the sum `k` among the `n` numbers in such a way that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation. The current approach does not guarantee this.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
