Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Let's analyze why this is the case:

The function `func_1` calculates the number of bits required to represent `k` in binary. The program then creates a sequence where one element is `2**counter - 1` (which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`), and another element is `k - (2**counter - 1)`. The rest of the elements are set to 0.

This approach does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. For example, consider the test case:

**Input:**
```
1
2 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 4
```
or
```
4 1
```
Both of these outputs have `1 | 4 = 5` which in binary is `101` and has 2 ones. Another valid output could be:
```
3 2
```
Here, `3 | 2 = 3` which in binary is `11` and has 2 ones. But the program might output:
```
3 2
```
which is correct in terms of sum but not necessarily optimal in terms of maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

However, a more problematic case is:
**Input:**
```
1
3 7
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2 4
```
Here, `1 | 2 | 4 = 7` which in binary is `111` and has 3 ones. The program might output:
```
7 0 0
```
which is correct in terms of sum but not optimal in terms of maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

The program should be designed to distribute the sum `k` among the `n` numbers in such a way that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation. The current approach does not guarantee this.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
