The function `highest_set_bit` is defined to take a single integer `n`. However, based on the problem description, the main function to solve the problem should take two integers `n` and `k` for each test case. Therefore, the correct function definition should be something like `def solve(n, k):` where `n` is the number of non-negative integers and `k` is their sum. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
