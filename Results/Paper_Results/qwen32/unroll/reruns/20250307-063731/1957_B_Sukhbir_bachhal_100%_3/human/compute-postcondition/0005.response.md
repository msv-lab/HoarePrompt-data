The given loop continuously right-shifts the value of `n` by 1 bit until `n` becomes 0. Each right shift operation effectively divides `n` by 2, and `position` is incremented by 1 for each shift. The loop terminates when `n` becomes 0, which happens after `position` has counted the number of bits required to represent the original value of `n` in binary form, excluding the leading zeros.

Therefore, after the loop finishes, `position` will hold the value equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `n`, which is also equivalent to the ceiling of the base-2 logarithm of `n` plus one.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `n`.**

In simpler terms, `n` will be reduced to 0, and `position` will indicate how many times `n` was divided by 2 until it reached 0.
