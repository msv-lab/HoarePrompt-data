#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to take two integers, `n` and `k`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= k <= 10^9`. However, based on the function definition provided, it seems there might be a discrepancy as the function is defined to take only one argument `n`. The correct function definition should include `k` as well. Assuming the correct function definition is `def func_1(n, k):`, the precondition would be: `n` and `k` are integers such that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= k <= 10^9`. Additionally, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State: `n` and `k` are integers such that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= k <= 10^9`. Additionally, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`. `n` is not equal to 0.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: `n` is 0, `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `n`.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns -1 if `n` is 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` and returns this count minus one.
