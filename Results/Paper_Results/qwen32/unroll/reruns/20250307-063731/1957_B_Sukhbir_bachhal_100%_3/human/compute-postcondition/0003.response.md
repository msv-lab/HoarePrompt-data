The code snippet provided initializes a variable `position` to 0. No other variables are modified or affected by this line of code. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers within certain ranges, and these conditions remain unchanged after the execution of the provided line of code.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= k <= 10^9`. Additionally, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`. `n` is not equal to 0; `position` is 0.**
