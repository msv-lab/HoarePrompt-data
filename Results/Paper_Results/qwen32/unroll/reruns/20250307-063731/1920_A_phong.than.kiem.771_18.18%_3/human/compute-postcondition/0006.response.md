The given code snippet only initializes the variable `count_num` to 0. It does not modify the values of `start`, `end`, `num`, `t`, or `v`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1`, `end` is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2`, `num` is a list of all `v` where `t == 3`, `t` and `v` are the values from the last iteration, `count_num` is 0.**
