To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `start`, `end`, `num`, `t`, and `v` based on the input values provided during each iteration.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `start` is initialized to -1.
   - `end` is initialized to 1000000000.0.
   - `num` is initialized to an empty list `[]`.
   - `t` and `v` are not initialized in the provided code snippet but are read from input during each iteration.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each iteration, `t` and `v` are read from input.
   - If `t == 1`, `start` is updated to `v` if `v` is greater than the current `start`.
   - If `t == 2`, `end` is updated to `v` if `v` is less than the current `end`.
   - If `t == 3`, `v` is appended to the list `num`.

3. **Final State:**
   - `start` will hold the maximum value of `v` encountered where `t == 1`.
   - `end` will hold the minimum value of `v` encountered where `t == 2`.
   - `num` will contain all values of `v` encountered where `t == 3`.
   - `t` and `v` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state and the loop's behavior, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1`, `end` is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2`, `num` is a list of all `v` where `t == 3`, `t` and `v` are the values from the last iteration.**
