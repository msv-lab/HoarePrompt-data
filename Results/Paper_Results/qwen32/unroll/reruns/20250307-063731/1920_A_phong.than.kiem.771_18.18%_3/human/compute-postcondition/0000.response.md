The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Given that `n` was initially defined as an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100`, the new value of `n` will be whatever integer is provided by the user input, but it is still constrained by the initial condition that it must be between 2 and 100 inclusive. The values of the other variables (`start`, `end`, `num`, `t`, and `v`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 (as per user input), `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is a list that will store integers, `t` is an integer that can be 1, 2, or 3, and `v` is an integer such that 1 <= v <= 10^9.**
