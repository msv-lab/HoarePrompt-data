The function reads a series of integer pairs, updating the maximum value (`start`) and minimum value (`end`) based on certain conditions, and collects a list of integers. It then calculates the number of integers within the range `[start, end]` that are not in the collected list and returns this count if it is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0.
