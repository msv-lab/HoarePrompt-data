### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program to ensure it meets the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It is supposed to read the number of test cases `t` from the input. However, the function's behavior is controlled by the `isOne` parameter, which is not provided in the code snippet. For the purpose of this task, we can assume that `isOne` is `False` so that it reads the input value.
   - The function is correctly set up to read an integer from the input when `isOne` is `False`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads a line of input and splits it into a list of substrings or characters, optionally converting them to integers.
   - It is not used in the given code snippet, but it is correctly described and would be useful if needed.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function concatenates elements of a list into a string with a specified separator.
   - It is not used in the given code snippet, but it is correctly described.

4. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function finds all starting indices of a substring within a string.
   - It is not used in the given code snippet, but it is correctly described.

5. **Function `func_5`:**
   - This function finds all indices of an element within a list.
   - It is not used in the given code snippet, but it is correctly described.

6. **Function `func_6`:**
   - This function searches for a sublist in a 2D list where the element at a specified index matches a given value.
   - It is not used in the given code snippet, but it is correctly described.

7. **Function `func_7`:**
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of constraints `n` and then iterates through each constraint.
   - For constraints of type `1`, it updates `start` to the maximum value.
   - For constraints of type `2`, it updates `end` to the minimum value.
   - For constraints of type `3`, it collects the values in the list `num`.
   - After processing all constraints, it calculates the number of integers `k` that are within the range `[start, end]` and not in the list `num`.
   - It correctly handles the case where `start > end` by returning `0`.
   - It correctly calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the count of integers in `num` from the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]`.

### Conclusion:

The code correctly processes each test case and calculates the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. The functions are correctly described and the logic within `func_7` is appropriate for solving the problem.

**Correctness: True**
