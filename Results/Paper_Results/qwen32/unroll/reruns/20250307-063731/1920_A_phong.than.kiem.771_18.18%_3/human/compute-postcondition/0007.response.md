The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the list `num`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `num`. If the list `num` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The value of `i` is determined by the elements in `num`, so we need to ensure that `num` has at least one element.

Given the state before the loop starts, the value of `num` is a list of all `v` where `t == 3`. For the loop to execute, `num` must contain at least one element. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `v`, and `count_num` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `num` has at least one element.

State: **`start` is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1`, `end` is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2`, `num` is a list of all `v` where `t == 3` and must have at least one element, `t` and `v` are the values from the last iteration, `count_num` is 0**
