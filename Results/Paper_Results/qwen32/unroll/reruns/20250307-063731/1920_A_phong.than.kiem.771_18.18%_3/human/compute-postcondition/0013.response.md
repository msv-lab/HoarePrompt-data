Functionality: **The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It returns 0 if a certain condition is met (Case_1). Otherwise, it returns the difference between the total number of integers from `start` to `end` inclusive and the count of integers from `num` within that range, provided this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0 (Case_2).**
