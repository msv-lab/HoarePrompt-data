The function reads a line of input and processes it based on the `space` and `to_int` parameters. If `space` is True, it splits the line into substrings separated by spaces; if False, it splits the line into individual characters. If `to_int` is True, it converts each substring or character to an integer and returns a list of these integers. If `to_int` is False, it returns the list of substrings or characters without conversion.
