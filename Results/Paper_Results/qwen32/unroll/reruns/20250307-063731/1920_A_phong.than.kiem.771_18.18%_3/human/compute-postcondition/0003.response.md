The code snippet provided resets the `num` list to an empty list. The values of the other variables (`n`, `start`, `end`, `t`, and `v`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is [], `t` is an integer that can be 1, 2, or 3, and `v` is an integer such that 1 <= v <= 10^9.**
