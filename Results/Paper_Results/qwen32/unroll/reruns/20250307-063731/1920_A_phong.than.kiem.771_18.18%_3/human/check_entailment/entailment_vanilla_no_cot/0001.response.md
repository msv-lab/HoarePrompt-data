Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing**:
    - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
    - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
    - It then reads `n` constraints, each described by a type `a` (1, 2, or 3) and a value `x`.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
    - The program initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1,000,000,000 (which is the maximum possible value for `x`).
    - It iterates through the constraints:
        - If the constraint type `a` is 1, it updates `start` to be the maximum of its current value and `x`.
        - If the constraint type `a` is 2, it updates `end` to be the minimum of its current value and `x`.
        - If the constraint type `a` is 3, it adds `x` to the list `num`.

3. **Counting Invalid Values**:
    - The program then counts how many values in `num` lie within the range `[start, end]` and stores this count in `count_num`.

4. **Calculating Valid k Values**:
    - If `start` is greater than `end`, it means there are no valid `k` values, so it returns 0.
    - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values as `end - start + 1 - count_num`. If this value is negative, it returns 0.

### Evaluation of the Program:

- **Initialization**: The initial values of `start` and `end` are set correctly to cover the full possible range of `x`.
- **Range Calculation**: The program correctly updates `start` and `end` based on constraints of types 1 and 2.
- **Exclusion of Invalid Values**: The program correctly identifies and excludes values from `num` that lie within the range `[start, end]`.
- **Final Calculation**: The final calculation of valid `k` values is correct, ensuring that no invalid values are counted and that the result is non-negative.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints. It handles all edge cases, including when there are no valid `k` values.

**Correctness: True**
