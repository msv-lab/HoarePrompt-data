### Reasoning:
The program is composed of multiple functions, but the core logic for solving the problem is encapsulated in `func_7`. This function processes each test case by reading constraints and determining the valid range for `k` based on the given constraints. It then calculates the number of integers within this range that do not violate any `k != x` constraints.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how `func_7` works:
1. **Initialization**: It initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1,000,000,000 (the maximum possible value for `x`).
2. **Reading Constraints**:
   - For each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `start` to be the maximum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `end` to be the minimum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to a list `num`.
3. **Counting Invalid Values**: It iterates through the list `num` and counts how many of these values lie within the range `[start, end]`.
4. **Calculating Valid Range**:
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it means there are no valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints, so it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]` and subtracts the count of invalid values from this total. If this result is non-negative, it returns this value; otherwise, it returns 0.

The other functions (`func_1` to `func_6`) are not directly involved in solving the problem as described. They seem to be utility functions that could be used in other contexts but do not contribute to the solution of this specific problem.

### Correctness:
The logic implemented in `func_7` correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. The function correctly updates `start` and `end` based on the constraints of type 1 and 2, and it accurately counts and subtracts the invalid values from the total range.

Thus, the program is correct as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
