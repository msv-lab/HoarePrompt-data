Postcondition: **start is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1`, end is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2`, num is a list of all `v` where `t == 3`, t and v are the values from the last iteration, count_num is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`. The current value of `start` is greater than the current value of `end`.**
