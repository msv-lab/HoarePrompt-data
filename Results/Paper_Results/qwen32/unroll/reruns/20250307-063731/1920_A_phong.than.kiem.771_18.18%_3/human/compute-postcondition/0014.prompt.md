You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, start and end are integers where start is initialized to -1 and end is initialized to 1000000000, num is a list that will store integers. t is an integer that can be 1, 2, or 3, and v is an integer such that 1 <= v <= 10^9.
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: `start` is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1`, `end` is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2`, `num` is a list of all `v` where `t == 3`, `t` and `v` are the values from the last iteration.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: start is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1`, end is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2`, num is a list of all `v` where `t == 3`, t and v are the values from the last iteration, count_num is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`.
    if (start > end) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: start is the maximum value of `v` where `t == 1`, end is the minimum value of `v` where `t == 2`, num is a list of all `v` where `t == 3`, t and v are the values from the last iteration, count_num is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`, and start is less than or equal to end
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #The program returns the difference between the total number of integers from `start` to `end` inclusive and the count of integers from `num` within that range if the difference is non-negative, otherwise it returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It returns 0 if a certain condition is met (Case_1). Otherwise, it returns the difference between the total number of integers from `start` to `end` inclusive and the count of integers from `num` within that range, provided this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0 (Case_2).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the difference between the total number of integers from `start` to `end` inclusive and the count of integers from `num` within that range if the difference is non-negative, otherwise it returns 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
