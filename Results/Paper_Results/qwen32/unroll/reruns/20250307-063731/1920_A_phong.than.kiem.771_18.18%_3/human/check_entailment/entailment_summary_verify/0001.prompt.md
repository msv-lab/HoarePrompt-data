You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 7 : The function reads a series of integer pairs, updating the maximum value (`start`) and minimum value (`end`) based on certain conditions, and collects a list of integers. It then calculates the number of integers within the range `[start, end]` that are not in the collected list and returns this count if it is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine the number of integers k that satisfy a set of constraints.
- There are three types of constraints:
  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x.
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x.
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x.
- The program is guaranteed to have at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, ensuring a finite solution.
- No two constraints are the same.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints and then each constraint.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - It initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1,000,000,000.
   - It iterates through each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (k must be >= x), it updates `start` to the maximum of its current value and x.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (k must be <= x), it updates `end` to the minimum of its current value and x.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (k must not be equal to x), it adds x to the list `num`.

3. **Counting Valid k Values**:
   - It counts how many numbers in `num` fall within the range [start, end].
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0 (no valid k).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of integers in the range [start, end] and subtracts the count of numbers in `num` that fall within this range.

### Correctness Check:
- **Handling Type 1 and Type 2 Constraints**:
  - The program correctly updates `start` and `end` based on type 1 and type 2 constraints.
  - If `start` ends up being greater than `end`, it correctly returns 0 because no integer can satisfy both constraints simultaneously.

- **Handling Type 3 Constraints**:
  - The program correctly counts the numbers in `num` that fall within the range [start, end].
  - It subtracts this count from the total number of integers in the range [start, end] to get the final result.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where there are no valid integers (e.g., when `start` > `end`).
  - It also handles cases where there are no numbers in `num` within the range [start, end].
  - The program ensures that the answer is finite and non-negative.

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
