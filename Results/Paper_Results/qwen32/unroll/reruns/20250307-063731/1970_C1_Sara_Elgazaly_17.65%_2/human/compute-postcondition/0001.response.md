The code snippet provided initializes a `defaultdict` with the key `list` as its default factory. This means that `lst` will be a dictionary where each key will default to an empty list if it does not exist. 

The initial state includes several variables (`n`, `t`, the tree edges, the starting nodes, `x`, and `y`), but the code snippet only impacts the `lst` variable.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` remains an integer between 2 and 200,000, `t` remains 1, the tree structure and its properties remain unchanged, the starting node for the round remains the same, and `x` and `y` retain their values. The new variable `lst` is initialized as a `defaultdict` where each key defaults to an empty list.
