Output State: **The loop will terminate when all nodes connected to the starting node have been visited and their neighbors have been processed. The final value of `x` will be a node that has no unvisited neighbors, and `s` will be `False` if the number of iterations is even, or `True` if the number of iterations is odd.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is toggled using the `not` operator. If `s` was `True`, it becomes `False`, and if `s` was `False`, it becomes `True`. The conditions for the loop termination and the final value of `x` remain unchanged.
