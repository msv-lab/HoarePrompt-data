The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This operation does not affect the initial conditions of `n`, `t`, the tree structure, or the starting node for each round. The only changes are to the variables `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input.**
