The provided code snippet only defines a `TypeVar` named `T` and does not modify any of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `v`, `p`). Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `v`, and `p` remain unchanged. The `TypeVar` `T` is a generic type variable used in type hinting and does not affect the runtime state of the variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000; `v` is a list of integers of size `n` such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9; `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
