You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])

def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num / 10)
    return a



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `num` between 1 and 200,000 inclusive and returns the sum of its digits.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` to 0. These will be used to store cumulative sums of the digit sums from 1 to 200,000.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation**: The program defines a function `func_1(num)` that calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `num`. This function works correctly by repeatedly taking the remainder of `num` when divided by 10 (to get the last digit), adding it to `a`, and then removing the last digit from `num` by integer division by 10.

3. **Pre-computation**: The program then pre-computes the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to 200,000 and stores these cumulative sums in the list `A`. This is done by iterating from 1 to 200,000, calculating the digit sum for each number using `func_1`, adding this digit sum to `sum`, and appending the current value of `sum` to `A`.

4. **Handling Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the value of `n`, and then prints the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to `n` by accessing `A[n - 1]`.

5. **Efficiency**: Pre-computing the cumulative sums up to 200,000 ensures that each test case can be handled in constant time, which is crucial given the constraint of 0.5 seconds per test case and the possibility of up to 10,000 test cases.

6. **Output**: For each test case, the program outputs the correct cumulative sum of the digit sums up to `n` by using the pre-computed list `A`.

Given the above steps, the program correctly calculates the required sum of the digit sums for each test case within the given constraints.
