To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition `num != 0` in the `while` loop. The loop will execute if `num` is not equal to 0.

Given:
- `num` is an integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is 0.

Since `num` is already constrained to be between 1 and 2 · 10^5, it is guaranteed that `num` is not equal to 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `num` to satisfy the loop condition.

The variable `a` is not part of the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state right before the loop can remain the same for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is 0**
