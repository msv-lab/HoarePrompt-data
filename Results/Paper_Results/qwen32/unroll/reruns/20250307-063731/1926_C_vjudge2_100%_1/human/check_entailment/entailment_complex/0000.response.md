### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by precomputing the sum of the digit sums for numbers from 1 to 200,000 and storing these cumulative sums in an array `A`. For each test case, it simply retrieves the cumulative sum up to the given `n` from this precomputed array. 

Let's break down the correctness of the program:

1. **Function `func_1(num)`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `num`. It iterates through each digit of `num`, adds it to `a`, and then removes the last digit from `num` by integer division by 10. This process continues until `num` is reduced to 0.
   - The function returns the sum of the digits, which is correct.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program precomputes the cumulative sum of the digit sums for numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores these cumulative sums in the array `A`.
   - For each number `i` from 1 to 200,000, it calculates the sum of its digits using `func_1(i)` and adds it to the cumulative sum `sum`, which is then stored in `A[i-1]`.
   - This precomputation is done outside of the test cases, ensuring that each test case can be handled in constant time by simply accessing the precomputed cumulative sum.

3. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and prints the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to `n`, which is stored in `A[n-1]`.
   - This approach ensures that the program can handle up to 10^4 test cases efficiently, as each test case is processed in constant time.

Given the constraints (with `t` up to 10^4 and `n` up to 2 * 10^5), the precomputation step is done only once and takes O(2 * 10^5) time, which is acceptable. Each test case is then handled in O(1) time.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it precomputes the necessary values efficiently and handles each test case in constant time.

Correctness: **True**
