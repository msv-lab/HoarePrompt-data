The provided loop takes an integer `num` and repeatedly extracts its last digit, adds it to `a`, and then removes the last digit from `num`. This process continues until `num` becomes 0. Essentially, the loop calculates the sum of all the digits of the original `num`.

Let's break it down:
1. `a` starts at 0.
2. In each iteration, the last digit of `num` is added to `a`.
3. The last digit is removed from `num` by performing integer division by 10.
4. This continues until `num` is reduced to 0.

After the loop finishes, `a` will hold the sum of the digits of the original `num`.

Output State: **`a` is the sum of the digits of the original `num`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the variable `a` will contain the sum of all the digits of the initial value of `num`.
