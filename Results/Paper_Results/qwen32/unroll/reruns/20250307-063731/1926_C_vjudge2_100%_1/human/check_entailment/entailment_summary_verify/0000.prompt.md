You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])

def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num / 10)
    return a



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `num` between 1 and 200,000 inclusive and returns the sum of its digits.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the sum of the digits for numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores the cumulative sums in an array `A`. It then uses this precomputed array to answer each test case by simply indexing into `A`. While this approach works for the given constraints, there is a logical error in the code that makes it incorrect for some cases.

The main issue is that the program does not correctly handle the input `n` when `n` is greater than 200,000. The problem description specifies that `n` can be up to `2 * 10^5` (which is 200,000), so the program should handle this correctly. However, the code does not account for any `n` greater than 200,000, which is theoretically possible according to the problem description.

Although the problem description includes a constraint that `n` will not exceed 200,000, the program should still be robust enough to handle the maximum possible value of `n` as specified. Since the program does not handle values of `n` greater than 200,000, it is not fully correct according to the problem description.

To make the program fully correct, it should include a check or a mechanism to handle cases where `n` is up to 200,000, even though the problem description specifies that `n` will not exceed this value. However, since the program does not handle this correctly, it is considered incorrect.
