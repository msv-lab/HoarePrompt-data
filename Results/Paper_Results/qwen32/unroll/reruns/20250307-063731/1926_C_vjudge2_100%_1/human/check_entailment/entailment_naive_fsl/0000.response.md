Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the sum of the digits for numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores the cumulative sums in an array `A`. It then uses this precomputed array to answer each test case by simply indexing into `A`. While this approach works for the given constraints, there is a logical error in the code that makes it incorrect for some cases.

The main issue is that the program does not correctly handle the input `n` when `n` is greater than 200,000. The problem description specifies that `n` can be up to `2 * 10^5` (which is 200,000), so the program should handle this correctly. However, the code does not account for any `n` greater than 200,000, which is theoretically possible according to the problem description.

Although the problem description includes a constraint that `n` will not exceed 200,000, the program should still be robust enough to handle the maximum possible value of `n` as specified. Since the program does not handle values of `n` greater than 200,000, it is not fully correct according to the problem description.

To make the program fully correct, it should include a check or a mechanism to handle cases where `n` is up to 200,000, even though the problem description specifies that `n` will not exceed this value. However, since the program does not handle this correctly, it is considered incorrect.
