### Reasoning:
The given program is designed to solve the problem by precomputing the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) and storing the cumulative sum in an array `A`. Then, for each test case, it simply retrieves the precomputed cumulative sum corresponding to the input number `n`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Precomputation**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` set to 0.
   - It then iterates over all integers from 1 to 200,000.
   - For each integer `i`, it computes the sum of its digits using the `func_1` function.
   - It adds this sum to the cumulative `sum` and appends the cumulative `sum` to the list `A`.

2. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
   - It then prints the cumulative sum stored in `A` at the index `n-1`, which corresponds to the sum of the sums of the digits from 1 to `n`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an integer `num` and computes the sum of its digits.
   - It does this by repeatedly taking the last digit of `num` (using `num % 10`), adding it to `a`, and then removing the last digit from `num` (using integer division `num = int(num / 10)`).

The program is logically correct in terms of its approach. It precomputes all necessary values and efficiently handles each test case by simply accessing the precomputed results. Given the constraints, this approach ensures that each test case is processed in constant time \(O(1)\), making the overall time complexity \(O(t)\), which is efficient given the problem constraints.
