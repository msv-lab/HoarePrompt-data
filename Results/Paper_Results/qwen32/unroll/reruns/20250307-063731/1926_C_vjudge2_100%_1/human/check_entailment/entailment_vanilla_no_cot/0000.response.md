Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error. The main issue is that the program precomputes the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to 200,000 and stores these sums in the list `A`. However, the program then uses these cumulative sums directly as the result for each test case, which is incorrect. The program should instead compute the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n` for each individual test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def digit_sum(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = num // 10  # Use integer division
    return a

for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total_sum += digit_sum(i)
    print(total_sum)
```

In this corrected version, for each test case, the program calculates the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n` and prints the result. This ensures that the program correctly handles each test case independently.
