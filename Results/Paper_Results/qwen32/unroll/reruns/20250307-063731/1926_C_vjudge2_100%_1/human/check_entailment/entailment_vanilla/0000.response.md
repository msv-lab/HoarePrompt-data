Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains an integer `t` (number of test cases).
   - Each of the next `t` lines contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5).

2. **Output:**
   - For each `n`, output the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`.

3. **Example:**
   - For `n = 12`, the numbers 1 through 12 are transformed to their digit sums: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3`. The sum of these numbers is `51`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Precomputation:**
   - The program precomputes the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores these cumulative sums in the list `A`.
   - For each integer `i` from 1 to 200,000, it calculates the sum of its digits using the `func_1` function and adds this to a running total `sum`.
   - This running total is then appended to the list `A`.

2. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, the program reads an integer `n` and prints the cumulative sum stored at index `n-1` in the list `A`.

3. **Digit Sum Calculation (`func_1` function):**
   - The `func_1` function correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `num` by repeatedly extracting the last digit (`num % 10`), adding it to the running total `a`, and then removing the last digit (`num = int(num / 10)`).

### Correctness Check:
- **Precomputation Validity:**
  - The precomputation step ensures that for any `n` up to 200,000, the program can quickly retrieve the sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to `n` by accessing the precomputed list `A`.
  - This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it avoids recalculating the digit sums for each test case.

- **Handling Large Inputs:**
  - The program handles up to 10^4 test cases, each with `n` up to 2·10^5. Given the precomputation, each test case is processed in constant time O(1) by simply accessing an element in the list `A`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the smallest possible input (`n = 1`) and the largest possible input (`n = 200,000`).

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality. It efficiently precomputes the necessary values and handles each test case within the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
