Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for generating an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Here are a few issues and counterexamples:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Subsequences**: The program attempts to construct the array by appending lengths of increasing subsequences derived from the binary representation of `X`. However, it does not correctly account for the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed by combining different subsequences.

2. **Handling of Small Values of X**: The program correctly handles the case when `X` is 2 by returning an array of length 1 with a single element. However, for other small values of `X`, the program might not generate the correct array.

3. **Handling of Large Values of X**: The program does not correctly handle large values of `X` (up to \(10^{18}\)). The approach of using binary representation and appending lengths of subsequences does not guarantee that the total number of increasing subsequences will be exactly `X`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where `X` is not a power of 2 or a sum of distinct powers of 2. For example, if `X` is 7, the program might not generate an array that has exactly 7 increasing subsequences.

5. **Output Format**: The program does not handle the output format correctly for all cases. For example, if `X` is 1, the program should return `-1` as it is impossible to have an array with exactly 1 increasing subsequence (since an empty subsequence is also considered increasing).

Let's consider a specific counterexample:
- **Input**: `X = 7`
- **Expected Output**: An array with exactly 7 increasing subsequences. One possible output is `3 2 3`, which has the following increasing subsequences: `[], [3], [2], [3], [3, 2], [3, 3], [3, 2, 3]`.
- **Actual Output**: The program might not generate this array or any other array with exactly 7 increasing subsequences.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect for various cases, and thus the correctness is `False`.
