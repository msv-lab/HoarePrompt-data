You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #State: To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the behavior of the given code.
    #
    #The loop continues as long as `x` is not equal to 0. Inside the loop, it finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x`, subtracts this power of 2 from `x`, and appends the exponent of this power of 2 (which is `i-1` after the inner loop) to `subseq_lens`. It also updates `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the exponent `i-1`.
    #
    #Let's break it down step by step:
    #
    #1. **Initialization**: `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and `x` is the integer read from the input, not equal to 2.
    #2. **Outer Loop**: The loop runs as long as `x` is not 0.
    #3. **Inner Loop**: For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop calculates the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x` by incrementing `i` until `2 ** i` exceeds `x`. The value of `i-1` is then the exponent of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x`.
    #4. **Appending to List**: The exponent `i-1` is appended to `subseq_lens`.
    #5. **Subtracting**: The largest power of 2 (i.e., `2 ** (i-1)`) is subtracted from `x`.
    #6. **Updating Maximum**: `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i-1`.
    #7. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `x` becomes 0.
    #
    #After the loop finishes, `x` will be 0, `subseq_lens` will contain the exponents of the powers of 2 that were subtracted from the original `x` in descending order, and `mx` will be the maximum of these exponents.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the exponents of the powers of 2 that summed up to the original `x`, and `mx` is the maximum of these exponents.**
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop, `x` will be 0, `subseq_lens` will have a list of the exponents of the binary representation of the original `x` in descending order, and `mx` will be the highest exponent in this list.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: - `x` remains 0.
    #  - `subseq_lens` remains the same (empty or [0]).
    #  - `mx` remains the same (undefined or 0).
    #  - `ansv` remains an empty list.
    #
    #Output State:
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 0
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for generating an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Here are a few issues and counterexamples:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Subsequences**: The program attempts to construct the array by appending lengths of increasing subsequences derived from the binary representation of `X`. However, it does not correctly account for the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed by combining different subsequences.

2. **Handling of Small Values of X**: The program correctly handles the case when `X` is 2 by returning an array of length 1 with a single element. However, for other small values of `X`, the program might not generate the correct array.

3. **Handling of Large Values of X**: The program does not correctly handle large values of `X` (up to \(10^{18}\)). The approach of using binary representation and appending lengths of subsequences does not guarantee that the total number of increasing subsequences will be exactly `X`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where `X` is not a power of 2 or a sum of distinct powers of 2. For example, if `X` is 7, the program might not generate an array that has exactly 7 increasing subsequences.

5. **Output Format**: The program does not handle the output format correctly for all cases. For example, if `X` is 1, the program should return `-1` as it is impossible to have an array with exactly 1 increasing subsequence (since an empty subsequence is also considered increasing).

Let's consider a specific counterexample:
- **Input**: `X = 7`
- **Expected Output**: An array with exactly 7 increasing subsequences. One possible output is `3 2 3`, which has the following increasing subsequences: `[], [3], [2], [3], [3, 2], [3, 3], [3, 2, 3]`.
- **Actual Output**: The program might not generate this array or any other array with exactly 7 increasing subsequences.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect for various cases, and thus the correctness is `False`.
