Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

# Annotated Program:

MOD = 1000000007

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program returns nothing (None)
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is the integer read from the input and is not equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0.
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the behavior of the given code.
    #
    #The loop continues as long as `x` is not equal to 0. Inside the loop, it finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x`, subtracts this power of 2 from `x`, and appends the exponent of this power of 2 (which is `i-1` after the inner loop) to `subseq_lens`. It also updates `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the exponent `i-1`.
    #
    #Let's break it down step by step:
    #
    #1. **Initialization**: `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and `x` is the integer read from the input, not equal to 2.
    #2. **Outer Loop**: The loop runs as long as `x` is not 0.
    #3. **Inner Loop**: For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop calculates the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x` by incrementing `i` until `2 ** i` exceeds `x`. The value of `i-1` is then the exponent of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x`.
    #4. **Appending to List**: The exponent `i-1` is appended to `subseq_lens`.
    #5. **Subtracting**: The largest power of 2 (i.e., `2 ** (i-1)`) is subtracted from `x`.
    #6. **Updating Maximum**: `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i-1`.
    #7. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `x` becomes 0.
    #
    #After the loop finishes, `x` will be 0, `subseq_lens` will contain the exponents of the powers of 2 that were subtracted from the original `x` in descending order, and `mx` will be the maximum of these exponents.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the exponents of the powers of 2 that summed up to the original `x`, and `mx` is the maximum of these exponents.**
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop, `x` will be 0, `subseq_lens` will have a list of the exponents of the binary representation of the original `x` in descending order, and `mx` will be the highest exponent in this list.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: - `x` remains 0.
    #  - `subseq_lens` remains the same (empty or [0]).
    #  - `mx` remains the same (undefined or 0).
    #  - `ansv` remains an empty list.
    #
    #Output State:
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 0
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: x remains 0. subseq_lens remains the same (empty or [0]). mx remains the same (undefined or 0). ansv remains an empty list.
    print()
    #This is printed: (newline)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `x` from the input. If `x` is 2, it prints 1 followed by 0. Otherwise, it calculates the exponents of the largest powers of 2 that sum up to `x`, constructs a list from these exponents, and prints the length of this list followed by the exponents themselves. The function returns nothing.
