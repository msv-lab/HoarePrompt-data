### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to find an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The logic in the program seems flawed for several reasons:

1. **Handling of the Input \( X \):**
   - The program correctly identifies the case where \( X = 2 \) and outputs an array `[0]` which indeed has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`.
   - For other values of \( X \), the program attempts to decompose \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2 and then constructs an array based on these exponents. However, the construction of the array from these exponents is incorrect.

2. **Constructing the Array:**
   - The program constructs the array `ansv` by first appending elements from `range(mx)` and then appending elements from `subseq_lens` starting from the second element. This approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - Specifically, the logic for constructing the array does not ensure that the resulting array will have the correct number of increasing subsequences. The array constructed may not be valid for the given \( X \).

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv`. However, the array `ansv` is not correctly constructed to meet the problem's requirements.
   - For example, for \( X = 5 \), the program should output an array that has exactly 5 increasing subsequences. The provided program does not achieve this.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for values of \( X \) other than 2. The logic for constructing the array from the exponents of the powers of 2 is flawed and does not ensure that the resulting array will have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.

### Correctness:
**False**
