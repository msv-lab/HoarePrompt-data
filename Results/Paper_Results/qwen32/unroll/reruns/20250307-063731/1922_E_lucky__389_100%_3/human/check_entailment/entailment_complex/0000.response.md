Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. The task is to find an array of integers such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences. The given code seems to be attempting to find a binary representation of X, but it does not construct an array that meets the problem's requirements.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Binary Representation Misuse**: The code attempts to decompose X into powers of 2, which is related to the binary representation of X. However, the binary representation of X does not directly translate into the required array of integers with exactly X increasing subsequences.

2. **Array Construction**: The code constructs an array `ansv` based on the exponents of the powers of 2 that sum up to X. This array does not necessarily have exactly X increasing subsequences. For example, for X = 5, the binary representation is 101, which corresponds to the powers of 2 as 4 and 1 (or exponents 2 and 0). However, the array constructed from these exponents does not guarantee exactly 5 increasing subsequences.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For X = 2, the output is correct: `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.
   - For X = 5, the binary representation is 101, which corresponds to exponents 2 and 0. The constructed array `[0, 0]` does not have exactly 5 increasing subsequences. It has 4: `[]`, `[0]`, `[0]`, and `[0, 0]`.
   - For X = 13, the binary representation is 1101, which corresponds to exponents 3, 2, and 0. The constructed array `[0, 0, 0]` does not have exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
   - For X = 37, the binary representation is 100101, which corresponds to exponents 5, 2, and 0. The constructed array `[0, 0, 0]` does not have exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

4. **Correct Approach**: To construct an array with exactly X increasing subsequences, a different strategy is needed. One possible approach is to use a combination of repeated elements and distinct elements to form the required number of subsequences. For example, using a sequence like `[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, ...]` can help in generating the required number of subsequences.

Given the issues with the current implementation, the program is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
