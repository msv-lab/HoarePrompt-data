You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program returns nothing (None)
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is the integer read from the input and is not equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0.
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the behavior of the given code.
    #
    #The loop continues as long as `x` is not equal to 0. Inside the loop, it finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x`, subtracts this power of 2 from `x`, and appends the exponent of this power of 2 (which is `i-1` after the inner loop) to `subseq_lens`. It also updates `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the exponent `i-1`.
    #
    #Let's break it down step by step:
    #
    #1. **Initialization**: `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and `x` is the integer read from the input, not equal to 2.
    #2. **Outer Loop**: The loop runs as long as `x` is not 0.
    #3. **Inner Loop**: For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop calculates the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x` by incrementing `i` until `2 ** i` exceeds `x`. The value of `i-1` is then the exponent of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x`.
    #4. **Appending to List**: The exponent `i-1` is appended to `subseq_lens`.
    #5. **Subtracting**: The largest power of 2 (i.e., `2 ** (i-1)`) is subtracted from `x`.
    #6. **Updating Maximum**: `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i-1`.
    #7. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `x` becomes 0.
    #
    #After the loop finishes, `x` will be 0, `subseq_lens` will contain the exponents of the powers of 2 that were subtracted from the original `x` in descending order, and `mx` will be the maximum of these exponents.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` contains the exponents of the powers of 2 that summed up to the original `x`, and `mx` is the maximum of these exponents.**
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop, `x` will be 0, `subseq_lens` will have a list of the exponents of the binary representation of the original `x` in descending order, and `mx` will be the highest exponent in this list.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: - `x` remains 0.
    #  - `subseq_lens` remains the same (empty or [0]).
    #  - `mx` remains the same (undefined or 0).
    #  - `ansv` remains an empty list.
    #
    #Output State:
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 0
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: x remains 0. subseq_lens remains the same (empty or [0]). mx remains the same (undefined or 0). ansv remains an empty list.
    print()
    #This is printed: (newline)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing (None).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing (None)
