The code snippet `x = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `x`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18. After the execution of the code, the value of `x` will be the integer read from the input, and the values of `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `x` is the integer read from the input.**
