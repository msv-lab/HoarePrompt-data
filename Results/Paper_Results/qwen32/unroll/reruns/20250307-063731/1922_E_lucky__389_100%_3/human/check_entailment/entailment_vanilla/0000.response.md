Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to generate an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The key points are:

1. An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array that are strictly increasing and in the same order as they appear in the array.
2. The array length should be at most 200.
3. If it's impossible to create such an array, we should output `-1`.
4. For each test case, we need to handle an integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18).

### Program Analysis

The program attempts to solve the problem by using binary representation of `X` to determine the lengths of increasing subsequences. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `X`.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `X` is 2, the program outputs an array of length 1 with a single element `0`. This is correct because the array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.

3. **Binary Representation**:
   - For `X > 2`, the program tries to represent `X` as a sum of powers of 2.
   - It iteratively finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `X` and subtracts it from `X`.
   - The exponents of these powers of 2 are stored in the list `subseq_lens`.

4. **Array Construction**:
   - The program constructs an array `ansv` where the first `mx` elements are `[0, 1, 2, ..., mx-1]`.
   - It then appends the remaining elements from `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

### Issues

The main issue with the program is the logic for constructing the array to ensure it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The program's approach of using binary representation and appending exponents does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

### Correctness

The program does not correctly solve the problem for all values of `X`. For example, consider `X = 5`. The binary representation of 5 is `101`, which corresponds to `2^2 + 2^0`. The program would generate an array like `[0, 1, 2]`, which has 8 increasing subsequences, not 5.

### Conclusion

Given the issues with the program's logic, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
