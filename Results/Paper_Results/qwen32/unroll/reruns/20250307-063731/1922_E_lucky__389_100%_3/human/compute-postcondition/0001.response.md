The code snippet initializes an empty list named `subseq_lens`. The values of `t` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the output state is that `t` is still an integer between 1 and 1000, `x` is still the integer read from the input, and `subseq_lens` is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is the integer read from the input, `subseq_lens` is an empty list.**
