Functionality: **The function reads an integer `x` from the input. If `x` is 2, it prints 1 followed by 0. Otherwise, it calculates the exponents of the largest powers of 2 that sum up to `x`, constructs a list from these exponents, and prints the length of this list followed by the exponents themselves. The function returns nothing.**
