You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if x == 2:
        print(1)
        print(0)
        return
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `x` from the input. If `x` is 2, it prints 1 followed by 0. Otherwise, it calculates the exponents of the largest powers of 2 that sum up to `x`, constructs a list from these exponents, and prints the length of this list followed by the exponents themselves. The function returns nothing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to generate an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The key points are:

1. An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array that are strictly increasing and in the same order as they appear in the array.
2. The array length should be at most 200.
3. If it's impossible to create such an array, we should output `-1`.
4. For each test case, we need to handle an integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18).

### Program Analysis

The program attempts to solve the problem by using binary representation of `X` to determine the lengths of increasing subsequences. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `X`.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `X` is 2, the program outputs an array of length 1 with a single element `0`. This is correct because the array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.

3. **Binary Representation**:
   - For `X > 2`, the program tries to represent `X` as a sum of powers of 2.
   - It iteratively finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `X` and subtracts it from `X`.
   - The exponents of these powers of 2 are stored in the list `subseq_lens`.

4. **Array Construction**:
   - The program constructs an array `ansv` where the first `mx` elements are `[0, 1, 2, ..., mx-1]`.
   - It then appends the remaining elements from `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

### Issues

The main issue with the program is the logic for constructing the array to ensure it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The program's approach of using binary representation and appending exponents does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

### Correctness

The program does not correctly solve the problem for all values of `X`. For example, consider `X = 5`. The binary representation of 5 is `101`, which corresponds to `2^2 + 2^0`. The program would generate an array like `[0, 1, 2]`, which has 8 increasing subsequences, not 5.

### Conclusion

Given the issues with the program's logic, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
