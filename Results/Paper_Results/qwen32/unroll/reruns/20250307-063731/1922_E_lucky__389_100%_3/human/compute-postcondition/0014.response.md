Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `x` is 0.
- `subseq_lens` is either empty or [0].
- `mx` is either undefined or 0.
- `ansv` is an empty list.

The print statement is:
```python
print(len(ansv))
```

Since `ansv` is described as an empty list, the length of `ansv` is 0.

Thus, the print statement will output the length of `ansv`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
