The given code snippet is:

```python
print(1)
```

The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `x` is the integer read from the input and its value is 2.
- `subseq_lens` is an empty list.
- `mx` is 0.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **1**
