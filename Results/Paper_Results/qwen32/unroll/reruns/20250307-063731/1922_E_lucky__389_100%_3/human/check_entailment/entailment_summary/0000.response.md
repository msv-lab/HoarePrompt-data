### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to construct an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The approach taken by the program is to decompose `X` into a sum of powers of 2. This is based on the observation that the number of increasing subsequences in a binary tree (or a sequence of distinct elements where each element can either be included or not included in a subsequence) is a power of 2.

However, the program does not correctly implement the logic to construct the required array. Here are the key issues:

1. **Binary Representation**: The program correctly identifies the binary representation of `X` by decomposing it into powers of 2. This part is correct.

2. **Array Construction**: The program constructs an array based on the exponents of the powers of 2, but this does not guarantee that the array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The sequence of exponents does not directly translate to an array with the desired properties.

3. **Handling of `X == 2`**: The program correctly handles the case where `X == 2` by printing an array of length 1 with a single element 0. This is because the only increasing subsequences are the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element itself.

4. **General Case**: For `X > 2`, the program constructs an array that does not necessarily have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The array constructed is simply a sequence of exponents, which does not guarantee the required properties.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all values of `X`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
