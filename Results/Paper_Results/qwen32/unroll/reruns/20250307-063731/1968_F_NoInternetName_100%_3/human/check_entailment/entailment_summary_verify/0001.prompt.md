You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict
#Function 1:
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())

#Function 2:
def func_2(arr, predicate):
    (l, r) = (0, len(arr))
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if predicate(arr[mid]):
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if predicate(arr[l]):
        return l
    return None

#Function 3:

    return func_2(arr, predicate)

#Function 4:
def func_4(arr, predicate):
    result = func_2(arr, predicate)
    if result is not None:
        return result + 1
    return None

    (n, q) = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))

    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
    for i in range(q):
        (l, r) = func_1(int)
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
        if upper > lower:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function processes a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if there exists a subarray within the specified range that has a cumulative XOR of zero. It prints "Yes" if such a subarray exists and "No" otherwise. The original list and query parameters remain unchanged throughout the process.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Understanding:
We need to determine if a given subarray can be divided into more than one segment such that the bitwise XOR of each segment is the same.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function reads a line of input and maps each element to a given type (in this case, integers). It's used to read `n`, `q`, the array `a`, and each query.
2. **Functions `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`**: These functions are binary search helpers. `func_2` and `func_3` are essentially the same and perform a binary search to find the largest index satisfying a predicate. `func_4` is similar but returns the index plus one if found.
3. **Function `func_5`**: This is the main function that processes each test case.
    - It reads `n` and `q`.
    - It reads the array `a`.
    - It computes the prefix XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
    - It maintains a dictionary `inds` where `inds[xor_val]` is a list of indices where the prefix XOR is `xor_val`.
    - For each query `(l, r)`, it checks if the subarray `a[l-1:r]` is interesting.
        - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, the subarray is interesting because the XOR of the entire subarray is zero, which can be trivially split into any number of parts with XOR zero.
        - Otherwise, it uses the `inds` dictionary to find the largest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the smallest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
        - If `upper > lower`, it means there is a valid split point where the XOR of the segments is the same, and the subarray is interesting.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting. It uses the prefix XOR array and binary search to efficiently find valid split points. The use of the `inds` dictionary allows quick lookups of indices with specific XOR values, which is crucial given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the example test cases.

Correctness: **True**
