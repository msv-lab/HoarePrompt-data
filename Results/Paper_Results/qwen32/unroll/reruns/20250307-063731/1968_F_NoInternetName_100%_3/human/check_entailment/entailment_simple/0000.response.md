### Reasoning:

The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of an array and a series of queries. The goal is to determine if a specified subarray can be split into two or more parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Cumulative XOR (`x` array)**:
   - The program calculates a cumulative XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the `i-1`th element.
   - This helps in quickly calculating the XOR of any subarray `a[l:r+1]` as `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.

2. **Index Mapping (`inds` dictionary)**:
   - A dictionary `inds` maps each unique cumulative XOR value to a list of indices where this value occurs in `x`.
   - This allows for efficient lookups of indices where a particular cumulative XOR value is achieved.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the cumulative XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` is zero (`x[r] ^ x[l-1] == 0`). If true, the subarray can be trivially split into two parts with equal XOR.
   - If the cumulative XOR is not zero, the program uses binary search (`func_2` and `func_4`) to find indices in `inds` that can potentially form valid splits.
   - Specifically, it looks for an index `lower` where the cumulative XOR up to that point matches `x[r]` and is before `l`, and an index `upper` where the cumulative XOR up to that point matches `x[l-1]` and is at or after `r`.
   - If such indices exist and `upper > lower`, it implies that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR.

4. **Binary Search Functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`)**:
   - These functions perform binary search to find the largest index satisfying a given predicate.
   - `func_2` finds the largest index such that the predicate is true.
   - `func_3` and `func_4` are wrappers around `func_2` with slight modifications to handle specific cases.

### Analysis:

- The program efficiently calculates cumulative XOR values and uses a dictionary for quick lookups.
- The binary search functions are correctly implemented to find the required indices.
- The logic for handling queries is sound, checking both the trivial case (zero cumulative XOR) and the more complex case using binary search.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the program and its logic, it appears to correctly determine whether a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values for each query. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
