Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if there exists a subarray within the specified range that has a cumulative XOR of zero. It prints "Yes" if such a subarray exists and "No" otherwise. The original list and query parameters remain unchanged throughout the process.**
