Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

# Annotated Functions:
from collections import defaultdict

if __name__ == '__main__':
    (t,) = func_1(int)
    for _ in range(t):
        func_5()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cast is a callable function that can convert strings to a desired type, such as int or float.
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())
    #The program returns an iterator that applies the function `cast` to each element of the list created by splitting the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a callable `cast` as an argument and returns an iterator that applies the `cast` function to each element of a list created by splitting an input string.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and predicate is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean value. The function `func_2` is used to find the largest index `l` in the range `[0, len(arr))` such that `predicate(arr[l])` is True.
def func_2(arr, predicate):
    l, r = 0, len(arr)
    while l + 1 < r:

    #State: `l` is the largest index such that `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`, and `r` is the smallest index such that `predicate(arr[r])` is `False`. Additionally, `predicate(arr[l])` is `False`.
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`. It returns the largest index `l` in the list such that `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`. If no such index exists, it returns `None`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and predicate is a function that takes a list as an argument.
def func_3(arr, predicate):
    return func_2(arr, predicate)
    #The program returns the result of func_2(arr, predicate), where arr is a list of integers and predicate is a function that takes a list as an argument.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a function `predicate` that takes a list as an argument. It returns the result of applying `predicate` to `arr`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and predicate is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean value.
def func_4(arr, predicate):
    result = func_2(arr, predicate)
    if (result is not None) :
        return result + 1
        #The program returns the integer value of `result` plus 1

    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`. It returns the integer value of `result` plus 1 if `result` is not `None`; otherwise, it returns `None`.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array, q is a positive integer representing the number of queries, a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 2^30 - 1, l and r are integers representing the start and end indices of the subarray for each query such that 1 <= l < r <= n.

    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
        
    #State: `n` and `q` are unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `l` and `r` are unchanged, `x` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR up to that point, `inds` is a `defaultdict` mapping each unique XOR result to a list of indices in `x`.

        l, r = func_1(int)
        
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:

            continue
        
        lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
        
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
        
        if upper > lower:

    #State: `n` and `q` are unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `l` and `r` are unchanged, `x` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR up to that point, `inds` is a `defaultdict` mapping each unique XOR result to a list of indices in `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if there exists a subarray within the specified range that has a cumulative XOR of zero. It prints "Yes" if such a subarray exists and "No" otherwise. The original list and query parameters remain unchanged throughout the process.
