The provided code snippet `n, q = func_1(int)` suggests that `n` and `q` are being assigned values returned by the function `func_1` which takes an integer as an argument. However, there is no further information about the function `func_1` or what it returns. Given the initial state and the code snippet, we can assume that `n` and `q` will be updated to the values returned by `func_1`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact new values for `n` and `q`. However, we can infer that `n` and `q` will be integers based on the assignment.

The other variables `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and 2^30 - 1, `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of the subarray for each query such that 1 <= l < r <= n.**
