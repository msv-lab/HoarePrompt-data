The code snippet provided initializes a `defaultdict` named `inds` with a list as its default factory. This means that `inds` is a dictionary where each key will have a default value of an empty list if the key does not exist.

Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `x` remain unchanged as the code snippet does not modify them. The only new variable introduced is `inds`, which is initialized as a `defaultdict(list)`.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of the subarray for each query such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is a list containing a single element `0`, `inds` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of `list`.**
