Let's walk through the loop and understand how the variables change with each iteration.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` and `q` are integers.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of a subarray.
- `x` is a list initialized with a single element `0`.
- `inds` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of `list` and `inds[0]` is a list containing a single element `0`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a`:
1. `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)`: This line appends a new element to the list `x`. The new element is the result of the XOR operation between the last element in `x` and the current element `i` from `a`.
2. `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)`: This line updates the `defaultdict` `inds`. It appends the index of the newly added element in `x` to the list associated with the key `x[-1]` in `inds`.

### Output State:
After the loop completes:
- `x` will have `n + 1` elements. The first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are the cumulative XOR results.
- `inds` will map each unique XOR result to a list of indices where that result appears in `x`.

### Formatted Output:
Output State: **`n` and `q` are unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `l` and `r` are unchanged, `x` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR up to that point, `inds` is a `defaultdict` mapping each unique XOR result to a list of indices in `x`.**
