### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a subarray can be split into two or more parts where the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. The provided Python program addresses this problem by using a combination of prefix XOR and binary search.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - `func_1` reads integers from the input and converts them to the desired type. This is used to read the number of test cases, the size of the array, the number of queries, the array itself, and the queries.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - `func_5` calculates the prefix XOR for the array. The prefix XOR at index `i` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1`. This helps in quickly calculating the XOR of any subarray.

3. **Index Mapping**:
   - `func_5` uses a dictionary `inds` to map each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this value occurs. This helps in finding indices of subarrays that have the same XOR value.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` is zero. If it is, the subarray is interesting.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is not zero, the program uses binary search (implemented in `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`) to find if there exists a subarray within the given range that can be split into parts with equal XOR.

5. **Binary Search**:
   - `func_2` performs a binary search to find the largest index in a list such that a given predicate is true.
   - `func_3` and `func_4` are utility functions that use `func_2` to find the appropriate indices for the subarray split.

### Evaluation:

- The program correctly calculates the prefix XOR for the array.
- It uses a dictionary to map prefix XOR values to their indices, which is efficient for lookups.
- The binary search functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) are used appropriately to find the indices that satisfy the conditions for the subarray to be interesting.
- The logic for checking the subarray's XOR and determining if it can be split into parts with equal XOR is correct.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality to determine if a subarray is interesting.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
