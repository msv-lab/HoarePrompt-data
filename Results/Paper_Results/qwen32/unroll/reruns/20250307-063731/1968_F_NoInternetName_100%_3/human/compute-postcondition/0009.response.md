Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, and `r`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array. `q` is a positive integer representing the number of queries. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and 2^30 - 1. For each query, `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of the subarray, with the condition that 1 <= l < r <= n. The function performs `q` queries on the array `a` and returns the result of each query, which is not specified in detail here.**
