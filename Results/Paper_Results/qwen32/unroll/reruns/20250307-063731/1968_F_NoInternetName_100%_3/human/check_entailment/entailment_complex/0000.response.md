### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given functions and their roles in solving the problem:

1. **func_1(cast)**:
   - This function reads a line of input and converts each element to the type specified by `cast`. It is used to read the number of test cases, the size of the array and number of queries, and the array elements and query ranges.

2. **func_2(arr, predicate)**:
   - This function performs a binary search on the list `arr` to find the largest index `l` such that `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`. It is a generic binary search utility that can be used to find specific indices based on a condition.

3. **func_3(arr, predicate)**:
   - This function simply calls `func_2(arr, predicate)`. It is redundant and can be removed without affecting the program's functionality.

4. **func_4(arr, predicate)**:
   - This function also calls `func_2(arr, predicate)` and then adds 1 to the result if the result is not `None`. This is used to find the smallest index greater than a given value that satisfies a predicate.

5. **func_5()**:
   - This function handles the core logic of solving the problem for each test case.
   - It reads the array and computes a list `x` where `x[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - It uses a dictionary `inds` to map each cumulative XOR value to a list of indices where this XOR value occurs.
   - For each query, it checks if the subarray from `l` to `r` can be split into parts with equal XOR by checking if there exists an index `lower` before `l` and an index `upper` after `r` such that the cumulative XORs at these indices are the same.

### Verification:
- The core idea is to use cumulative XOR values and their indices to determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR.
- The use of binary search (`func_2` and `func_4`) ensures that the solution is efficient.
- The logic in `func_5` correctly implements the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions together correctly implement the solution to the problem. The program reads the input, computes necessary cumulative XOR values, and efficiently checks each query using binary search.

**Correctness: True**
