The code snippet `inds[0].append(0)` appends the integer `0` to the list that is the value for the key `0` in the `defaultdict` `inds`. Since `inds` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of `list`, if the key `0` does not already exist, it will be created with an empty list as its value before the `0` is appended.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of the subarray for each query such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is a list containing a single element `0`, `inds` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of `list` and `inds[0]` is a list containing a single element `0`.**
In natural language: The value for the key `0` in the `defaultdict` `inds` is now a list containing a single element `0`. All other variables retain their initial values.
