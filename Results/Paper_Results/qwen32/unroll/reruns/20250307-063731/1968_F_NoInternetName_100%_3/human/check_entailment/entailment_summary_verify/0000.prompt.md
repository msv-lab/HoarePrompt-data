You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function processes a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if there exists a subarray within the specified range that has a cumulative XOR of zero. It prints "Yes" if such a subarray exists and "No" otherwise. The original list and query parameters remain unchanged throughout the process.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program is designed to determine if a subarray can be split into more than one part such that the bitwise XOR of all parts is equal. 

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and processes `q` queries.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - It also maintains a dictionary `inds` that maps each prefix XOR value to the list of indices at which that value occurs.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program checks if the subarray `a[l-1:r]` can be split into more than one part with equal XOR.
   - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it means the entire subarray `a[l-1:r]` has a XOR of 0, which can trivially be split into any number of parts with XOR 0.
   - Otherwise, it looks for a prefix XOR value `x[r]` that appears before `l` and a prefix XOR value `x[l-1]` that appears at or after `r`. If such indices exist, it means the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR.

### Correctness Check

Let's check if the program handles all edge cases and meets the problem description:

1. **Trivial Split (XOR = 0):**
   - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, the subarray `a[l-1:r]` has a XOR of 0, which can be split trivially.
   - The program correctly handles this case.

2. **Non-trivial Split:**
   - The program uses the prefix XOR values and their indices to find potential splits.
   - It checks if there exists a prefix XOR value `x[r]` that appears before `l` and a prefix XOR value `x[l-1]` that appears at or after `r`.
   - This is a valid approach to determine if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `l == 1` and `r == n` correctly.
   - It also handles cases where the subarray cannot be split into parts with equal XOR.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly handle all the described cases and edge cases. The logic used is sound and the implementation follows the problem description accurately.

**Correctness: True**

The program correctly determines whether a subarray can be split into more than one part such that the bitwise XOR of all parts is equal for all potential cases.
