The code snippet provided is `a = list(func_1(int))`. This line of code suggests that `func_1` is a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns a list of integers. The returned list is then assigned to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state, `a` was already a list of `n` integers. The function `func_1` is called with an integer argument, and its return value (a list) is assigned to `a`, overwriting the previous value of `a`.

Since the function `func_1` and the integer argument passed to it are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the specific new value of `a`. However, we know that `a` is now the list returned by `func_1`.

The other variables (`n`, `q`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of the subarray for each query such that 1 <= l < r <= n.**
