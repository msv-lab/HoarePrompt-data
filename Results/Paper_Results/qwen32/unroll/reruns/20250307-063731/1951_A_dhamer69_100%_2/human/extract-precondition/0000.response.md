It seems there is a mismatch between the provided problem description and the function definition. The problem description talks about a function named `generate_files_for_html_in_range` with parameters `start` and `end`, but the function definition provided is `def func():`. Assuming the function definition should match the problem description, here is the precondition:

Problem description: The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` is designed to generate specific files for HTML files found within subfolders of the current directory, where the subfolder names are digits within a specified range.

Function definition (assumed correct based on problem description):
```
def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):
```

Precondition: **start and end are integers such that start <= end.**
