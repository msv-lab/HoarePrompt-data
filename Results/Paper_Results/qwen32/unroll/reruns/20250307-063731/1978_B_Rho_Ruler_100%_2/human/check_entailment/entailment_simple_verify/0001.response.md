### Reasoning:
The original assessment provides a detailed and accurate breakdown of the logic and reasoning behind the provided program. Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the program based on the problem description, the program code, and the annotations.

#### Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`:
- **Purpose**: Calculate the profit for a given `k`.
- **Calculation**:
  - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the promotional price is calculated using the formula `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`. This formula correctly computes the sum of the arithmetic series `b + (b-1) + ... + (b-k+1)`.
  - The profit from selling the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price is `(n - k) * a`.
  - The function returns the sum of these two profits.
- **Annotation**: The annotation confirms that the function returns \( k \times b - k \times \left( \frac{k - 1}{2} \right) + (n - k) \times a \), which matches the intended logic.

#### Function `func_2(n, a, b)`:
- **Purpose**: Determine the maximum profit by iterating over possible values of `k` from `0` to `min(n, b)`.
- **Binary Search**:
  - The function initializes `low` to `0` and `high` to `min(n, b)`.
  - It performs a binary search to find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
  - The profit at the middle point (`mid`) and the profit at the next point (`mid + 1`) are compared.
  - The search narrows down the range based on the comparison, ensuring that the maximum profit is found efficiently.
- **Annotation**: The annotation confirms that the binary search correctly identifies the optimal `k` and that `max_profit` is the maximum achievable profit.

#### Binary Search Justification:
- **Unimodal Function**: The profit function is unimodal, meaning it increases up to a point and then decreases. This property makes binary search an efficient method to find the maximum profit.
- **Time Complexity**: The binary search reduces the time complexity to \(O(\log(\min(n, b)))\) per test case, which is efficient for the given constraints.

#### Edge Cases:
- **k = 0**: All buns are sold at the usual price `a`. This is correctly handled by the function.
- **k = min(n, b)**: All buns are sold at the promotional price. This is also correctly handled by the function.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately describes the logic and reasoning behind the program. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling the buns using the promotional strategy. The use of binary search ensures that the solution is efficient even for large inputs.

Final: **True**
