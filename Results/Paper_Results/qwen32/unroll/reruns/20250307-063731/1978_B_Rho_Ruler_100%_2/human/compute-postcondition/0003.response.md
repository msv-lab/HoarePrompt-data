To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and its impact on the variables. The loop uses a binary search approach to find the maximum profit by adjusting the number of buns sold at the modified price (`mid`).

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `low` starts at 0.
   - `high` starts at `min(n, b)`.
   - `max_profit` starts at 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - `mid` is calculated as the integer division of `(low + high) // 2`.
   - `profit_mid` is calculated using the function `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`.
   - `profit_next` is calculated using the function `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
   - `max_profit` is updated to be the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.
   - If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.

### Outcome:
The loop effectively finds the maximum profit by testing different values of `mid` (number of buns sold at the modified price) and adjusting the search range based on whether the next possible profit is higher or not. The loop terminates when `low` exceeds `high`, meaning the optimal `mid` value has been found.

### Final Output State:
- `low` will be greater than `high` after the loop terminates.
- `high` will be the optimal number of buns sold at the modified price.
- `max_profit` will hold the maximum profit achievable.

### Output State:
Output State: **low is greater than high, high is the optimal number of buns sold at the modified price, max_profit is the maximum achievable profit.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `low` will be one more than `high`, `high` will represent the best number of buns to sell at the modified price to maximize profit, and `max_profit` will be the highest profit that can be achieved under these conditions.
