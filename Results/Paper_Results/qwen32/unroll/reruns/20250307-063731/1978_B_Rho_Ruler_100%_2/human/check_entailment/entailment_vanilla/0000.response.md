### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling `n` buns with a promotional pricing strategy. The strategy involves selling the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1` and the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price `a`.

#### Step-by-step Breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns with the promotional price is calculated as `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`. This formula comes from the sum of an arithmetic series: `b + (b-1) + ... + (b-k+1)`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The function returns the total profit for a given `k`.

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function determines the maximum profit by iterating over possible values of `k` from `0` to `min(n, b)`.
   - It uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - The binary search compares the profit of the middle point (`mid`) with the profit of the next point (`mid + 1`).
   - If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater than the profit at `mid`, it means the maximum profit is likely to be on the right side, so `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the maximum profit is likely on the left side, so `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
   - The maximum profit found during the search is returned.

3. **Binary Search Justification**:
   - The profit function defined by `func_1` is unimodal for a given `n`, `a`, and `b`. This means it first increases and then decreases as `k` increases.
   - A binary search is efficient for finding the maximum point in a unimodal function, reducing the time complexity to `O(log(min(n, b)))` per test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where `k = 0` (all buns sold at the usual price).
   - It also handles cases where `k = min(n, b)` (all buns sold at the promotional price).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling the buns using the promotional strategy. The use of binary search ensures that the solution is efficient even for large inputs.

Correctness: **True**
