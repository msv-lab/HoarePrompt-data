### Reasoning:
Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version.

#### Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`:
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the total profit for a given number of buns sold at the modified price `k`.
- **Formula**: The function uses the formula `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
  - `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2` computes the sum of the arithmetic series representing the promotional prices of the first `k` buns.
  - `(n - k) * a` computes the profit from selling the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price `a`.
- **Correctness**: The formula is correct and accurately computes the profit for any given `k`.

#### Function `func_2(n, a, b)`:
- **Purpose**: This function determines the maximum profit by finding the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price.
- **Binary Search**: The function uses binary search to efficiently find the maximum profit.
  - **Initialization**: `low` is set to 0 and `high` is set to `min(n, b)`.
  - **Loop**: The loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
  - **Mid Calculation**: `mid` is calculated as the integer division of `(low + high) // 2`.
  - **Profit Comparison**: The profit for `mid` and `mid + 1` is compared.
    - If `profit_next > profit_mid`, it indicates that the maximum profit is likely to be on the right side, so `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
    - Otherwise, the maximum profit is likely on the left side, so `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
  - **Termination**: The loop terminates when `low` exceeds `high`, and `max_profit` holds the maximum profit found.

#### Binary Search Justification:
- **Unimodal Function**: The profit function defined by `func_1` is unimodal, meaning it first increases and then decreases as `k` increases.
- **Efficiency**: Binary search is efficient for finding the maximum point in a unimodal function, reducing the time complexity to `O(log(min(n, b)))` per test case.

#### Edge Cases:
- **k = 0**: All buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
- **k = min(n, b)**: All buns are sold at the promotional price.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after key operations.
- They accurately describe the logic and the flow of the program.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling the buns using the promotional strategy. The use of binary search ensures that the solution is efficient even for large inputs. The annotations accurately describe the program's behavior and reasoning.

Final: **True**
