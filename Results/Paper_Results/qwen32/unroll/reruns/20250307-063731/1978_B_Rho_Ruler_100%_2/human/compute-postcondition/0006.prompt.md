You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of buns, a is a non-negative integer representing the usual price of a bun, and b is a non-negative integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
def func_2(n, a, b):
    low, high = 0, min(n, b)
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State: low is greater than high, high is the optimal number of buns sold at the modified price, max_profit is the maximum achievable profit.
    return max_profit
    #The program returns max_profit, which is the maximum achievable profit.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of buns), `a` (the usual price of a bun), and `b` (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). It calculates and returns `max_profit`, which is the maximum achievable profit by strategically pricing the buns.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns max_profit, which is the maximum achievable profit.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
