You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The purpose of these functions is to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules.

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**: This function calculates the profit for a given `k` (the number of buns sold at the modified price). The formula used is:
   - `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`: This part calculates the total revenue from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price. The price for the `i-th` bun is `(b - i + 1)`. The sum of the first `k` terms of this sequence is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
   - `(n - k) * a`: This part calculates the total revenue from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**: This function uses a binary search approach to find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit. The search range for `k` is from `0` to `min(n, b)`. The binary search helps in efficiently finding the optimal `k` value.

### Verification:
- The binary search in `func_2` ensures that we check the profit for all possible values of `k` efficiently.
- The profit calculation in `func_1` correctly reflects the promotion rules: the first `k` buns are sold at decreasing prices starting from `b` down to `(b - k + 1)`, and the remaining buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
- The program handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description, including when `k` is `0` or `n`, and when `b` is less than `n`.

### Testing with the provided examples:
- For the input `4 4 5`, the function correctly calculates the maximum profit as `17`.
- For the input `5 5 9`, the function correctly calculates the maximum profit as `35`.
- For the input `10 10 5`, the function correctly calculates the maximum profit as `100`.
- For the input `5 5 11`, the function correctly calculates the maximum profit as `45`.
- For the input `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`, the function correctly calculates the maximum profit as `1000000000000000000`.
- For the input `1000000000 1000000000 1`, the function correctly calculates the maximum profit as `1000000000000000000`.
- For the input `1000 1 1000`, the function correctly calculates the maximum profit as `500500`.

Since the program correctly handles all the provided examples and adheres to the problem description for every potential case, it is correct.
