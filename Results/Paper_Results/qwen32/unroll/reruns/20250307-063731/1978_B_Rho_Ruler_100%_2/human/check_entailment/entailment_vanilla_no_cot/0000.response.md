To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented in `func_2` correctly finds the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the promotion rules.

### Analysis:

1. **Binary Search Approach**:
    - The program uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k`, the number of buns sold at the modified price.
    - The search range is between `0` and `min(n, b)` because `k` cannot exceed the number of buns `n` or the maximum possible modified price `b`.

2. **Profit Calculation**:
    - The profit for a given `k` is calculated in `func_1`:
      - `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2` calculates the total revenue from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price.
      - `(n - k) * a` calculates the total revenue from selling the remaining buns at the usual price.
    - The total profit is the sum of these two components.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
    - The binary search iteratively narrows down the range of `k` to find the maximum profit.
    - At each step, it compares the profit for `mid` and `mid + 1`:
      - If `profit_next > profit_mid`, it means increasing `k` increases the profit, so the search continues in the higher half.
      - Otherwise, the search continues in the lower half.
    - The maximum profit found during the search is returned.

### Correctness Verification:

- The binary search logic is sound and correctly narrows down the optimal `k` by comparing the profit for consecutive values.
- The profit calculation in `func_1` accurately reflects the problem's rules.

### Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **First Test Case**:
    - Input: `4 4 5`
    - Expected Output: `17`
    - The program should choose `k = 1` and calculate the profit as `5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17`.

2. **Second Test Case**:
    - Input: `5 5 9`
    - Expected Output: `35`
    - The program should choose `k = 5` and calculate the profit as `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35`.

3. **Third Test Case**:
    - Input: `10 10 5`
    - Expected Output: `100`
    - The program should choose `k = 0` and calculate the profit as `10 * 10 = 100`.

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
    - Input: `5 5 11`
    - Expected Output: `45`
    - The program should choose `k = 5` and calculate the profit as `11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45`.

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
    - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
    - Expected Output: `1000000000000000000`
    - The program should choose `k = 1000000000` and calculate the profit as `1000000000 * 1000000000 - 1000000000 * 999999999 // 2 + 0 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.

6. **Sixth Test Case**:
    - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
    - Expected Output: `1000000000000000000`
    - The program should choose `k = 0` and calculate the profit as `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.

7. **Seventh Test Case**:
    - Input: `1000 1 1000`
    - Expected Output: `500500`
    - The program should choose `k = 1000` and calculate the profit as `1000 + 999 + 998 + ... + 1 = 500500`.

The program correctly handles all the test cases, so it is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
