### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules. The key is to find the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price, which maximizes the total profit.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the profit for a given `k`. It computes the profit based on the formula:
  \[
  \text{profit} = k \times b - k \times \left(\frac{k - 1}{2}\right) + (n - k) \times a
  \]
  - `k * b` represents the total revenue from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price.
  - `k * (k - 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, representing the total discount applied to the first `k` buns.
  - `(n - k) * a` represents the revenue from selling the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price `a`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function finds the maximum profit by iterating over possible values of `k` within the range `[0, min(n, b)]`. It uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
- **Binary Search**: The function performs a binary search on the possible values of `k`. It calculates the profit at the midpoint (`mid`) and compares it with the profit at the next midpoint (`mid + 1`). Based on this comparison, it adjusts the search range (`low` and `high`) to converge on the optimal `k`.

#### Correctness:
- **Formula Accuracy**: The formula used in `func_1` correctly calculates the profit for a given `k` based on the problem's rules.
- **Binary Search Efficiency**: The binary search in `func_2` efficiently narrows down the optimal `k` within the range `[0, min(n, b)]`, ensuring that the maximum profit is found.
- **Edge Cases**: The functions handle edge cases, such as when `k = 0` (selling all buns at the usual price) and when `k = min(n, b)` (selling all buns at the modified price).

### Conclusion:
Given the correct implementation of the profit calculation and the efficient search for the optimal `k`, the program correctly solves the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
