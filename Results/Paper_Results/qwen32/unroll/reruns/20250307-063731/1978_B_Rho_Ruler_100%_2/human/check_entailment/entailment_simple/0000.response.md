### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns, with the option to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price that decreases by 1 coin for each subsequent bun, and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price.

**Key Points:**

1. **Profit Calculation:**
   - For a given `k`, the profit can be calculated using the formula provided in `func_1`:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]
     - The first term `k * b` represents the revenue from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price.
     - The second term `- k * (k - 1) // 2` adjusts the revenue to account for the decreasing price of each subsequent bun.
     - The third term `(n - k) * a` represents the revenue from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

2. **Binary Search for Optimal `k`:**
   - The function `func_2` uses a binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`, as `k` cannot exceed `n` or `b`.
   - For each midpoint `mid` in the search range, it calculates the profit for `mid` and `mid + 1` buns sold at the modified price.
   - It updates `max_profit` with the maximum profit found so far.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it narrows the search range to the right half (`low = mid + 1`); otherwise, it narrows it to the left half (`high = mid - 1`).
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, at which point `high` represents the optimal `k`, and `max_profit` is the maximum achievable profit.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The algorithm handles cases where `k = 0` (selling all buns at the usual price) and `k = min(n, b)` (selling as many buns as possible at the modified price).
   - It efficiently computes the profit using the provided formula and binary search, ensuring that it works within the constraints (up to \(10^9\) for `n`, `a`, and `b`).

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling the buns under the given promotion rules. The use of binary search ensures that the program runs efficiently even for large input values.

**Correctness: **True**
