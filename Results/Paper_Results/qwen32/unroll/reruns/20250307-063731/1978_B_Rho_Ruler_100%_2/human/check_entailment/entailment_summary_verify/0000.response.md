### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct based on the provided problem description, code, and function summaries. Here is the detailed reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - The function calculates the profit for a given `k` (the number of buns sold at the modified price).
   - The formula `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2` correctly computes the total revenue from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price. This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `(b - k + 1)`.
   - The formula `(n - k) * a` correctly computes the total revenue from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`.
   - This function adheres to the problem description and correctly computes the profit for any given `k`.

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - The search range for `k` is from `0` to `min(n, b)`, which is appropriate because `k` cannot exceed the number of buns or the modified price sequence.
   - The binary search efficiently narrows down the optimal `k` by comparing the profit at `mid` and `mid + 1`.
   - The function correctly updates `low` and `high` based on the comparison of profits, ensuring that the maximum profit is found.

### Verification:
- The binary search used in `func_2` ensures that the function efficiently finds the optimal `k` value.
- The profit calculation in `func_1` correctly reflects the promotion rules.
- The program handles all edge cases, such as when `k` is `0` or `n`, and when `b` is less than `n`.

### Testing with the provided examples:
- The function correctly calculates the maximum profit for all provided examples, as verified in the original assessment.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
