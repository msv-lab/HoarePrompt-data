The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `low` and the value `min(n, b)` to the variable `high`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Since `high` is set to the minimum of `n` and `b`, we need to consider the possible values of `n` and `b`:

- If `n <= b`, then `high` will be equal to `n`.
- If `n > b`, then `high` will be equal to `b`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a non-negative integer representing the usual price of a bun, `b` is a non-negative integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, `low` is 0, `high` is min(n, b)**.
