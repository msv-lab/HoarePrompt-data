You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling `n` buns with a promotional pricing strategy. The strategy involves selling the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1` and the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price `a`.

#### Step-by-step Breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns with the promotional price is calculated as `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`. This formula comes from the sum of an arithmetic series: `b + (b-1) + ... + (b-k+1)`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The function returns the total profit for a given `k`.

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function determines the maximum profit by iterating over possible values of `k` from `0` to `min(n, b)`.
   - It uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - The binary search compares the profit of the middle point (`mid`) with the profit of the next point (`mid + 1`).
   - If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater than the profit at `mid`, it means the maximum profit is likely to be on the right side, so `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the maximum profit is likely on the left side, so `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
   - The maximum profit found during the search is returned.

3. **Binary Search Justification**:
   - The profit function defined by `func_1` is unimodal for a given `n`, `a`, and `b`. This means it first increases and then decreases as `k` increases.
   - A binary search is efficient for finding the maximum point in a unimodal function, reducing the time complexity to `O(log(min(n, b)))` per test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where `k = 0` (all buns sold at the usual price).
   - It also handles cases where `k = min(n, b)` (all buns sold at the promotional price).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling the buns using the promotional strategy. The use of binary search ensures that the solution is efficient even for large inputs.
