To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition `low <= high`. The variables `low` and `high` are the only ones that can be adjusted according to the given instructions.

- `low` is initialized to 0.
- `high` is initialized to `min(n, b)`.

For the loop to execute, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`. Since `low` is 0, `high` must be at least 0 for the condition to be true. Given that `high` is `min(n, b)`, it will always be non-negative (since `n` and `b` are non-negative integers).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the initial values of `low` and `high` to ensure that the loop can execute. The initial state already satisfies the condition `low <= high`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a non-negative integer representing the usual price of a bun, `b` is a non-negative integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, `low` is 0, `high` is min(n, b), `max_profit` is 0**
