Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The purpose of these functions is to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules.

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**: This function calculates the profit for a given `k` (the number of buns sold at the modified price). The formula used is:
   - `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`: This part calculates the total revenue from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price. The price for the `i-th` bun is `(b - i + 1)`. The sum of the first `k` terms of this sequence is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
   - `(n - k) * a`: This part calculates the total revenue from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**: This function uses a binary search approach to find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit. The search range for `k` is from `0` to `min(n, b)`. The binary search helps in efficiently finding the optimal `k` value.

### Verification:
- The binary search in `func_2` ensures that we check the profit for all possible values of `k` efficiently.
- The profit calculation in `func_1` correctly reflects the promotion rules: the first `k` buns are sold at decreasing prices starting from `b` down to `(b - k + 1)`, and the remaining buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
- The program handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description, including when `k` is `0` or `n`, and when `b` is less than `n`.

### Testing with the provided examples:
- For the input `4 4 5`, the function correctly calculates the maximum profit as `17`.
- For the input `5 5 9`, the function correctly calculates the maximum profit as `35`.
- For the input `10 10 5`, the function correctly calculates the maximum profit as `100`.
- For the input `5 5 11`, the function correctly calculates the maximum profit as `45`.
- For the input `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`, the function correctly calculates the maximum profit as `1000000000000000000`.
- For the input `1000000000 1000000000 1`, the function correctly calculates the maximum profit as `1000000000000000000`.
- For the input `1000 1 1000`, the function correctly calculates the maximum profit as `500500`.

Since the program correctly handles all the provided examples and adheres to the problem description for every potential case, it is correct.
