### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selling all `n` buns, where the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price.

#### Breakdown of the Functions:

1. **`func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the total profit for a given `k` (number of buns sold at the modified price).
   - The formula used is: \( k \times b - k \times \left( \frac{k - 1}{2} \right) + (n - k) \times a \).
   - This formula correctly computes the total profit by summing the profit from the first `k` buns (which follow the modified price pattern) and the remaining `n-k` buns (which are sold at the usual price `a`).

2. **`func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function performs a binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`, as `k` cannot exceed the number of buns `n` or the value `b`.
   - It iteratively calculates the profit for the middle point `mid` and the next point `mid + 1` using `func_1`.
   - It updates `max_profit` with the maximum of the current `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.
   - It adjusts the search range based on the comparison of `profit_next` and `profit_mid`, ensuring that the search converges to the optimal `k`.
   - Finally, it returns `max_profit`, which is the maximum achievable profit.

### Verification with Test Cases:

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `n = 4, a = 4, b = 5`
   - Calculation: `func_2(4, 4, 5)` will determine the optimal `k` and calculate the maximum profit.
   - Expected Output: `17`
   - The program correctly calculates this as `5 (first bun) + 4 (second bun) + 4 (third bun) + 4 (fourth bun) = 17`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `n = 5, a = 5, b = 9`
   - Calculation: `func_2(5, 5, 9)` will determine the optimal `k` and calculate the maximum profit.
   - Expected Output: `35`
   - The program correctly calculates this as `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `n = 10, a = 10, b = 5`
   - Calculation: `func_2(10, 10, 5)` will determine the optimal `k` and calculate the maximum profit.
   - Expected Output: `100`
   - The program correctly calculates this as `10 * 10 = 100` (since `k = 0` is optimal).

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `n = 5, a = 5, b = 11`
   - Calculation: `func_2(5, 5, 11)` will determine the optimal `k` and calculate the maximum profit.
   - Expected Output: `45`
   - The program correctly calculates this as `11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45`.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000`
   - Calculation: `func_2(1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)` will determine the optimal `k` and calculate the maximum profit.
   - Expected Output: `1000000000000000000`
   - The program correctly calculates this as `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000` (since `k = 0` is optimal).

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1`
   - Calculation: `func_2(1000000000, 1000000000, 1)` will determine the optimal `k` and calculate the maximum profit.
   - Expected Output: `1000000000000000000`
   - The program correctly calculates this as `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000` (since `k = 0` is optimal).

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000`
   - Calculation: `func_2(1000, 1, 1000)` will determine the optimal `k` and calculate the maximum profit.
   - Expected Output: `500500`
   - The program correctly calculates this as `1000 + 999 + ... + 1 + 1 + 1 + ... + 1 = 500500`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selling the buns according to the given promotion rules. The binary search in `func_2` ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently, and `func_1` accurately computes the profit for any given `k`.

**Correctness: True**
