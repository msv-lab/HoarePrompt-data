Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly generate an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. The approach used in the code does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly X, especially for larger values of X. The program attempts to decompose X into sums of powers of 2, which is not a correct strategy for constructing an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.

For example, the code does not correctly handle cases where X is not a power of 2 or a sum of distinct powers of 2. The construction of the array `ansv` does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly X.

The problem requires a more sophisticated approach, such as using binary representation and carefully constructing the array to ensure the exact number of increasing subsequences. The given solution does not meet these requirements.
