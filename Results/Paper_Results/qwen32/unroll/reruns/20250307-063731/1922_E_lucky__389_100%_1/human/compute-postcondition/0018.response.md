Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `x` from the input. If `x` is 2, it prints `1` followed by `0` and returns. Otherwise, it calculates the exponents of distinct powers of 2 that sum up to `x`, constructs a list `ansv` based on these exponents, and prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv`. The function returns nothing (None).**
