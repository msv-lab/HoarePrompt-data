Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. If no such array exists, the program should output `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to solve the problem by decomposing the input `X` into powers of 2. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of its logic:

1. **Base Case Handling**: If `X` is 2, the program outputs an array of length 1 with a single element `0`. This is correct because the only increasing subsequences of `[0]` are the empty subsequence and `[0]` itself, totaling 2 subsequences.

2. **Decomposition into Powers of 2**: For other values of `X`, the program decomposes `X` into a sum of distinct powers of 2. This is done by finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `X` and subtracting it from `X`, repeating this process until `X` becomes 0.

3. **Array Construction**: The program constructs an array `ansv` based on the exponents of the powers of 2 used in the decomposition. It then prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv`.

### Function Summary Recap:
The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the input. If `X` is 2, it prints `1` followed by `0` and returns. Otherwise, it calculates the exponents of distinct powers of 2 that sum up to `X`, constructs a list `ansv` based on these exponents, and prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv`.

### Original Assessment Recap:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect, citing issues with the calculation of subsequence lengths, handling of edge cases, and array construction.

### Evaluation:
Let's revisit the original assessment with the provided function summary and the problem description:

1. **Calculation of Subsequence Lengths**: The program decomposes `X` into powers of 2, which is a valid approach for certain configurations of increasing subsequences. Specifically, for arrays where each element can either be included or not included in a subsequence independently, the number of subsequences is a sum of powers of 2.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle cases where `X` cannot be decomposed into a valid array configuration. However, the problem does not provide a clear criterion for when no such array exists, and the program's approach is valid for many cases.

3. **Array Construction**: The constructed array `ansv` is based on the exponents of the powers of 2. This approach can work for certain values of `X`, but it may not work for all values, especially larger ones that require more complex array configurations.

### Specific Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the test case `X = 13`:

- **Decomposition**: `13 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0`.
- **Exponents**: The exponents are `3, 2, 0`.
- **Array Construction**: The program constructs the array `ansv` as `[0, 1, 2, 3, 2]` (since it appends the exponents in a specific manner).

However, this array does not necessarily have exactly 13 increasing subsequences. The expected output for `X = 13` is `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]`, which indeed has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The program's approach is not universally correct for all values of `X`. The decomposition into powers of 2 and the subsequent array construction do not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all possible values of `X`.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
