Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an input integer; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `mx` has been assigned the value 0. All other variables (`t`, `X`, `x`, and `subseq_lens`) retain their initial values.
