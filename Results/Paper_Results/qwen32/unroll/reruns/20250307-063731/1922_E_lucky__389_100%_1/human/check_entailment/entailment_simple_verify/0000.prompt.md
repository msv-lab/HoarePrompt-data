You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for generating an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. Specifically, the approach used in the function `func_1` is flawed for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Subsequence Lengths**: The program attempts to decompose the input X into powers of 2, which is not a correct strategy for generating the required number of increasing subsequences. The number of increasing subsequences for a given array is not directly related to powers of 2, except in very specific and limited cases.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, when X is a large number that cannot be decomposed into a valid array configuration, the program should return `-1`. However, the current implementation does not correctly identify such cases.

3. **Array Construction**: The constructed array `ansv` does not guarantee that it will have exactly X increasing subsequences. The logic for appending elements to `ansv` is flawed and does not ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.

To illustrate, let's consider a specific test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
13
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
2 2 3 4 2
```

**Actual Output of the Given Program:**
```
5
0 1 2 3 2
```

The actual output does not have exactly 13 increasing subsequences. The program needs a more robust and correct approach to generate the array that meets the requirement of having exactly X increasing subsequences.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
