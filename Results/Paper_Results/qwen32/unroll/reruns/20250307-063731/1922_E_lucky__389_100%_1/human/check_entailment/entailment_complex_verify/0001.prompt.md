You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `x` from the input. If `x` is 2, it prints `1` followed by `0` and returns. Otherwise, it calculates the exponents of distinct powers of 2 that sum up to `x`, constructs a list `ansv` based on these exponents, and prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv`. The function returns nothing (None).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Find an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences. If no such array exists, output -1.
2. **Increasing Subsequences**: An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array that are strictly increasing and in the same order as they appear in the array.
3. **Constraints**: 
   - \( t \) (number of test cases) is between 1 and 1000.
   - \( X \) (number of increasing subsequences) is between 2 and \( 10^{18} \).
   - The array length should be at most 200.
   - The elements of the array should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the value of \( X \).
3. If \( X = 2 \), it outputs an array of length 1 with a single element 0.
4. For other values of \( X \), it calculates the binary representation of \( X \) and constructs an array based on the binary representation.
5. The array is constructed such that the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \).

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Binary Representation**: The program uses the binary representation of \( X \) to determine the lengths of increasing subsequences. However, the construction of the array does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly \( X \).
2. **Array Construction**: The program constructs the array by appending elements based on the binary representation, but this does not ensure that the array will have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when \( X \) is a power of 2 or when \( X \) is very large.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible values of \( X \). The construction of the array based on the binary representation of \( X \) does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly \( X \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the issues in the array construction method and the handling of edge cases.

Correctness: **False**
