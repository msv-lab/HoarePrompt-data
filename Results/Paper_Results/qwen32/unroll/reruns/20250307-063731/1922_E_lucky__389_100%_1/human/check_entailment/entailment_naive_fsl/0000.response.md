Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for generating an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. Specifically, the approach used in the function `func_1` is flawed for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Subsequence Lengths**: The program attempts to decompose the input X into powers of 2, which is not a correct strategy for generating the required number of increasing subsequences. The number of increasing subsequences for a given array is not directly related to powers of 2, except in very specific and limited cases.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, when X is a large number that cannot be decomposed into a valid array configuration, the program should return `-1`. However, the current implementation does not correctly identify such cases.

3. **Array Construction**: The constructed array `ansv` does not guarantee that it will have exactly X increasing subsequences. The logic for appending elements to `ansv` is flawed and does not ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.

To illustrate, let's consider a specific test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
13
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
2 2 3 4 2
```

**Actual Output of the Given Program:**
```
5
0 1 2 3 2
```

The actual output does not have exactly 13 increasing subsequences. The program needs a more robust and correct approach to generate the array that meets the requirement of having exactly X increasing subsequences.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
