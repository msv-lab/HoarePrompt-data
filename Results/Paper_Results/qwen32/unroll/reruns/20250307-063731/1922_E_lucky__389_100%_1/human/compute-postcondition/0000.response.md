The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `x`. The initial state includes `t` as an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer within the range 2 to \(10^{18}\). The variable `x` is assigned the value of the input, which is an integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an input integer.**
