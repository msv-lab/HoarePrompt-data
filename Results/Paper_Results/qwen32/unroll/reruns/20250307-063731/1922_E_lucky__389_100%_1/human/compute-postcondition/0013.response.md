Based on the initial state provided, we have the following variable definitions:
- `x` is set to 0.
- `subseq_lens` is an empty list `[]`.
- `mx` is set to 0.
- `ansv` is an empty list `[]`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(len(ansv))
```

Here, `len(ansv)` calculates the length of the list `ansv`. Since `ansv` is explicitly stated to be an empty list `[]`, the length of `ansv` is 0.

Therefore, the print statement will output the integer value 0.

Output: **0**
