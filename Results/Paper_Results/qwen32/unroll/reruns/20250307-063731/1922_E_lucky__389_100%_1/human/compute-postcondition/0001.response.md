The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `subseq_lens`. This action does not affect the values of `t` or `x`, nor does it modify the test cases or their respective `X` values. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the `subseq_lens` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an input integer; `subseq_lens` is an empty list.**
