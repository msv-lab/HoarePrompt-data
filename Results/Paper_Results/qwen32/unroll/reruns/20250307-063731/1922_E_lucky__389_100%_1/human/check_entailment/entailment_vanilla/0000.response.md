Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Find an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences. If no such array exists, output -1.
2. **Increasing Subsequences**: An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array that are strictly increasing and in the same order as they appear in the array.
3. **Constraints**: 
   - \( t \) (number of test cases) is between 1 and 1000.
   - \( X \) (number of increasing subsequences) is between 2 and \( 10^{18} \).
   - The array length should be at most 200.
   - The elements of the array should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the value of \( X \).
3. If \( X = 2 \), it outputs an array of length 1 with a single element 0.
4. For other values of \( X \), it calculates the binary representation of \( X \) and constructs an array based on the binary representation.
5. The array is constructed such that the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \).

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Binary Representation**: The program uses the binary representation of \( X \) to determine the lengths of increasing subsequences. However, the construction of the array does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly \( X \).
2. **Array Construction**: The program constructs the array by appending elements based on the binary representation, but this does not ensure that the array will have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when \( X \) is a power of 2 or when \( X \) is very large.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible values of \( X \). The construction of the array based on the binary representation of \( X \) does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly \( X \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the issues in the array construction method and the handling of edge cases.

Correctness: **False**
