### Reasoning:

The program's objective is to construct an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The approach taken by the program is based on the observation that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be constructed using binary representation of `X`.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Base Case for `X = 2`**:
   - When `X` is 2, the only increasing subsequences possible are the empty subsequence and the subsequence consisting of a single element. Therefore, the array `[0]` is a valid answer.

2. **General Case for `X > 2`**:
   - The program decomposes `X` into a sum of distinct powers of 2. This is because each power of 2 corresponds to a unique combination of increasing subsequences.
   - For example, if `X = 13`, its binary representation is `1101`, which corresponds to the sum `2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13`. This means we need subsequences of lengths corresponding to the exponents of these powers of 2.
   - The program then constructs an array where the number of distinct increasing subsequences matches `X`. The array is constructed such that the number of subsequences of a certain length corresponds to the exponents of 2 that sum up to `X`.

3. **Array Construction**:
   - The array is constructed by appending elements in such a way that it generates the required number of increasing subsequences. For example, the array `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` for `X = 5` generates exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[2]`, `[2]`, `[2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 4]`.
   - The program ensures that the array length is at most 200 and all elements are within the range `[-10^9, 10^9]`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `X` is 2 separately, ensuring the output is correct for the smallest possible `X` greater than 1.
   - The program correctly handles larger values of `X` by decomposing them into sums of distinct powers of 2 and constructing the corresponding array.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences by leveraging the binary representation of `X`. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the output meets the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: True**
