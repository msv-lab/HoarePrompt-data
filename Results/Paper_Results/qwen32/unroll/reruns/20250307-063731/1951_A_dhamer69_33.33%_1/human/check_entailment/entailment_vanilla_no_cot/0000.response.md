Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description describes a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` that scans subfolders in the current directory, checks if their names are within a specified range, and generates corresponding files for HTML files found in those subfolders. However, the given program is a different function `func()` that reads input values and performs a different set of operations unrelated to the problem description.
