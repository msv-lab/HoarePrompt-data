To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition specified in the loop head, which is `t > 0`. The variables `start` and `end` are not part of the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Given the condition `t > 0`, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer. Since `t` is an input integer, we can adjust its value to ensure that the loop condition is satisfied.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop condition is `t > 0`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. Since `t` is an input integer, we can adjust its value to any positive integer.

To make sure the loop executes at least once, we can set `t` to a positive integer, such as 1.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` must be greater than 0**.

For clarity and to meet the requirement of providing a specific value, we can set `t` to 1:

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is 1**.
