The `print(1)` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the variables `low`, `high`, `st`, `arr`, or `k`. The statement simply prints the integer `1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
- The initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print(1)` statement is a direct instruction to output the number `1`.

Therefore, the output is simply the number `1`.

Output: **1**
