To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to analyze how the loop modifies the variables `low`, `high`, and `st` based on the initial conditions and the loop's logic.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`.
- `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`.
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
- `low` is initialized to 0.
- `high` is initialized to `n - 1`.
- `st` is initialized to an empty set.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop continues as long as `low + 1 < high`. In each iteration:
1. `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
2. `mid` is added to the set `st`.
3. If `arr[mid] > k`, `high` is updated to `mid`.
4. Otherwise, `low` is updated to `mid`.

### Loop Termination:
The loop terminates when `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. At this point, `low` and `high` will be consecutive indices.

### Final Output State:
- `low` and `high` will be two consecutive indices such that `arr[low] <= k < arr[high]` (if `k` is not exactly equal to `arr[low]` or `arr[high]`), or `low` will point to the first occurrence of `k` if `k` is found in `arr`.
- `st` will contain all the `mid` values that were calculated during the iterations of the loop.

### Natural Language Explanation:
The loop performs a binary search-like operation to narrow down the range between `low` and `high` where the value `k` might be located or just above/below. The set `st` keeps track of all the midpoints considered during this process. Once the loop terminates, `low` and `high` will be consecutive indices, and `st` will contain all the midpoints that were used to reach this state.

### Output State:
Output State: **`low` and `high` are consecutive indices, and `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop iterations.**
