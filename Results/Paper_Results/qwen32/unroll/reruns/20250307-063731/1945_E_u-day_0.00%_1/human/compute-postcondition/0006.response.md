The code snippet creates an empty set named `st`. None of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is an empty set.**
