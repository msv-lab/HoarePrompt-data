To determine the output of the `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and understand the context of the variables `low` and `pos`.

### Initial State Recap:
1. **`low` and `high` are consecutive indices**: This means that `high` is `low + 1` or `low - 1`.
2. **`st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop iterations**: This suggests that `st` is a list of midpoints used in some kind of loop, likely a binary search loop.
3. **`arr[low]` is not equal to `k`**: This indicates that the element at index `low` in the array `arr` does not match the value `k`.

### Variables:
- **`low`**: An index in the array `arr`.
- **`high`**: An index in the array `arr`, consecutive to `low`.
- **`pos`**: Not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the print statement.

### Analysis:
Given that `low` and `high` are consecutive indices, and without additional information about `pos`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```

### Output Description:
- **`low + 1`**: Since `low` is an index, `low + 1` will be the next index in the array `arr` after `low`.
- **`pos + 1`**: The variable `pos` is not defined in the initial state, so we can only describe it as `pos + 1`, where `pos` is some index or position used in the context of the loop.

Since `pos` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know it is an index or position used during the loop iterations.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the values of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, where `low` is an index in the array `arr` and `pos` is an index or position used in the context of the loop.

Output: **low + 1, pos + 1 (where low is an index in the array `arr` and pos is an index or position used in the context of the loop)**
