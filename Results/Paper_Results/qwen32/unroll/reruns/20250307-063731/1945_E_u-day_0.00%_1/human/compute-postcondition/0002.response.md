The code snippet simply initializes a variable `pos` with the value `-1`. None of the other variables (`n`, `k`, and `arr`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of `n`, `k`, and `arr`, and `pos` is now `-1`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, with `n` being a positive integer and `k` being a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n; `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1.**
