The code assigns the result of `func_2()` to the variable `arr`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are the outputs of `func_1()` and not affected by `func_2()`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, with `n` being a positive integer and `k` being a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n; `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`.**
