The code snippet assigns the values `0` and `n - 1` to the variables `low` and `high` respectively. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The variable `pos` retains its value as the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`.**
