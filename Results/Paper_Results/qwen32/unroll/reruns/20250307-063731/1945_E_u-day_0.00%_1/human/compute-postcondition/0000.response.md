The code snippet assigns the values returned by the function `func_1()` to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n. 

After executing the code, the values of `n` and `k` will be the values returned by `func_1()`. The precondition that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n is still valid, but the specific values of `n` and `k` will be those returned by `func_1()`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, with `n` being a positive integer and `k` being a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n.**
