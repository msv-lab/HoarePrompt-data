You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. The function `func_1` is expected to read input from standard input, split it by spaces, and return the resulting values as integers.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers obtained by splitting the input string by spaces.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_2` does not take any parameters. It relies on the output of another function `func_1`, which is expected to return a list.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns the list that `func_1` returns

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n.

            pos = i
        
    #State: `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.

            low = mid
        
    #State: `low` and `high` are consecutive indices, and `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop iterations.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: low + 1, pos + 1 (where low is an index in the array `arr` and pos is an index or position used in the context of the loop)
    #State: `low` and `high` are consecutive indices, and `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop iterations. If `arr[low]` equals `k`, then `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found using a binary search algorithm.
2. We can perform at most 2 swaps on the permutation to make the binary search successful.
3. The binary search algorithm is described, and the goal is to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - `func_1()` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers.
   - `func_2()` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers (same as `func_1()`).
   - `func_3()` reads the number of elements `n` and the target number `x`, and then reads the permutation `arr`.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The program iterates through the permutation `arr` to find the index `pos` of the element `x`.

3. **Binary Search Simulation:**
   - The program initializes `low` and `high` pointers and performs a binary search simulation.
   - It keeps track of the `mid` values in a set `st`.
   - If the element at `low` is equal to `x`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` indicating one swap is needed and suggests swapping the elements at positions `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Binary Search:**
   - The binary search simulation in the program does not correctly simulate the binary search algorithm. It does not ensure that the array is sorted or that the binary search will find the correct element.
   - The program simply checks if the element at `low` is equal to `x` after the simulation, which is not a valid approach to ensure the binary search will find `x`.

2. **Incorrect Swap Suggestion:**
   - The program suggests swapping the elements at positions `low + 1` and `pos + 1` if `x` is not at `low`. However, this swap may not guarantee that the binary search will find `x` after the swap.

3. **Lack of Handling Two Swaps:**
   - The problem allows for up to two swaps, but the program only suggests one swap and does not handle the case where two swaps are necessary.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It does not ensure that the binary search will find `x` after performing at most two swaps. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
