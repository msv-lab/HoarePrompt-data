Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it meets the problem description.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - `func_1` reads a line of input and returns a map object containing the integers.
   - `func_2` converts the map object returned by `func_1` into a list.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - `func_3` is called for each test case.
   - `n` and `x` are read from the input, representing the length of the permutation and the number to be found, respectively.
   - The permutation `arr` is read from the input.

3. **Finding the Position of `x`**:
   - `func_3` searches for the position `pos` of `x` in `arr`. If `x` is not found, `pos` remains `-1`.

4. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - Binary search is simulated using variables `low` and `high`.
   - The loop continues until `low` and `high` are consecutive.
   - During each iteration, the midpoint `mid` is calculated and added to a set `st`.
   - Depending on whether `arr[mid]` is greater than `x`, `high` or `low` is updated.

5. **Output**:
   - If `arr[low]` equals `x`, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` (1-based index).

### Issues in the Provided Program:
- The program does not perform any swaps on the array `arr` before the binary search. It only simulates the binary search and checks if `arr[low]` equals `x`.
- The problem states that you can perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that the binary search ends with `p_l` equal to `x`. The provided program does not implement this swapping logic.
- The program assumes that the binary search will end with `arr[low]` equal to `x` after at most one swap, which is not always true. It needs to consider the possibility of performing up to 2 swaps to achieve the desired result.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the problem description because it does not implement the logic to perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that the binary search ends with `p_l` equal to `x`.

Correctness: **False**
