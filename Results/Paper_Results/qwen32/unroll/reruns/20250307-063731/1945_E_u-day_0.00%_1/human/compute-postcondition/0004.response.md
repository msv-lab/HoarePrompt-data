To determine the output state after the execution of the given loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior:

1. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`.
2. For each index `i` in this range, it checks if the element at `arr[i]` is equal to `k`.
3. If `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, it updates the variable `pos` with the current index `i`.
4. If no such element is found (i.e., `k` is not present in `arr`), `pos` remains -1.

Given this behavior, after the loop finishes executing, `pos` will either hold the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or it will remain -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.**
