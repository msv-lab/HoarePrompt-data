### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to manipulate a permutation array using at most two swaps so that after performing a binary search, the element at the `low` index is equal to the target value `x`. The binary search algorithm provided in the problem statement is standard, and the function `func_3` seems to be implementing a part of the solution.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the function `func_3`:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - `func_1()` reads the first line of each test case, which contains the length of the permutation `n` and the target value `x`.
   - `func_2()` reads the second line, which contains the permutation array `arr`.

2. **Finding the Target Position**:
   - The function iterates through the permutation array to find the index `pos` where the target value `x` is located.

3. **Binary Search Simulation**:
   - The function initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `n-1`. It then performs a binary search to find the position where `x` would be located if the array were sorted.
   - During the binary search, the function keeps track of the `mid` positions in a set `st` (though this set is not used later in the function).

4. **Output**:
   - If the value at `arr[low]` is equal to `x`, the function prints `0`, indicating no swaps are needed.
   - Otherwise, the function prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, indicating that a single swap between the elements at these positions is required to make `arr[low]` equal to `x`.

### Analysis:
- The function does not perform any swaps on the array but only determines if a single swap is sufficient to make `arr[low]` equal to `x` after the binary search.
- The problem statement guarantees that up to two swaps are always sufficient, but the function only handles the case where one swap is needed.
- If the function encounters a case where two swaps are necessary, it does not handle it and would incorrectly output a single swap or no swap.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_3` does not fully meet the problem's requirements because it does not handle cases where two swaps are necessary. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
