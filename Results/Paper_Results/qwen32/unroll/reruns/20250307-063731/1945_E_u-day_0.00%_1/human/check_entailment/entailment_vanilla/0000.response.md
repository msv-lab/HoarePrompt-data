Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found using a binary search algorithm.
2. We can perform at most 2 swaps on the permutation to make the binary search successful.
3. The binary search algorithm is described, and the goal is to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - `func_1()` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers.
   - `func_2()` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers (same as `func_1()`).
   - `func_3()` reads the number of elements `n` and the target number `x`, and then reads the permutation `arr`.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`:**
   - The program iterates through the permutation `arr` to find the index `pos` of the element `x`.

3. **Binary Search Simulation:**
   - The program initializes `low` and `high` pointers and performs a binary search simulation.
   - It keeps track of the `mid` values in a set `st`.
   - If the element at `low` is equal to `x`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` indicating one swap is needed and suggests swapping the elements at positions `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Binary Search:**
   - The binary search simulation in the program does not correctly simulate the binary search algorithm. It does not ensure that the array is sorted or that the binary search will find the correct element.
   - The program simply checks if the element at `low` is equal to `x` after the simulation, which is not a valid approach to ensure the binary search will find `x`.

2. **Incorrect Swap Suggestion:**
   - The program suggests swapping the elements at positions `low + 1` and `pos + 1` if `x` is not at `low`. However, this swap may not guarantee that the binary search will find `x` after the swap.

3. **Lack of Handling Two Swaps:**
   - The problem allows for up to two swaps, but the program only suggests one swap and does not handle the case where two swaps are necessary.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It does not ensure that the binary search will find `x` after performing at most two swaps. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
