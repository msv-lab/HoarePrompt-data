Let's analyze the provided `while` loop and determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the loop can proceed.

The `while` loop condition is `low + 1 < high`. This means that for the loop to execute, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true.

Given the state:
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`.
- `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`.
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n - 1`.
- `st` is an empty set.

The variables `low` and `high` are the only ones that appear in the loop condition. 

To ensure that `low + 1 < high` is true, we need to make sure that the value of `high` is at least 1 greater than `low`. Since `low` is initialized to 0, `high` must be at least 1.

Given that `high` is initialized to `n - 1`, for `high` to be at least 1, `n - 1` must be at least 1, which means `n` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is at least 2. No other variables in the loop condition need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is an empty set**
