Functionality: **The function determines the position of a given integer `k` in a permutation array of length `n` and prints specific values based on whether `k` is found at a certain position. It prints `0` if `arr[low]` equals `k`, otherwise it prints `1` followed by `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, where `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found.**
