The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop iterates over the range defined by `n`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the value of `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer and is returned by `func_1()`, we don't need to adjust `n` itself because the condition for the loop to execute is already satisfied by `n` being a positive integer.

The variables `k`, `arr`, and `pos` are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition, so they do not need to be adjusted according to the loop head requirements.

Thus, the state before the loop starts, adjusted to ensure the loop can execute, is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1**
