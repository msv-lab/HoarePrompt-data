Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not always correctly rearrange the permutation so that after performing the binary search, the element at position `l` is equal to `x`. Here are a few issues and edge cases that the program does not handle:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search is not properly implemented to handle the requirement of finding the position `l` such that `p[l] == x` after rearranging the array. The current implementation does not ensure that the array is sorted or rearranged correctly before performing the binary search.

2. **Handling of Swaps**: The program only considers one swap if the binary search does not find the element at the correct position. However, it is stated that up to two swaps are allowed, and the program does not utilize this capability effectively. It might not be able to correctly place the element `x` at the correct position with just one swap in some cases.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the permutation is already sorted or where multiple elements need to be rearranged to place `x` at the correct position.

To illustrate with a specific example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4 2
3 4 1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
2
1 3
1 4
```

Explanation of Expected Output:
- Swap elements at positions 1 and 3: `1 4 3 2`
- Swap elements at positions 1 and 4: `2 4 3 1`
- After these swaps, the array is `2 4 3 1`, and binary search will correctly identify `p[0]` as `2`.

However, the provided program might not perform these swaps correctly and might output an incorrect result.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and therefore, it is incorrect.
