### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program to determine its correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
    - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
    - For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.

2. **Sorting Coordinates:**
    - The coordinates are stored in a list and sorted. Sorting helps in identifying the adjacent corners easily.

3. **Calculating Side Lengths:**
    - The program calculates the squared distance between the first two sorted points (`p1`) and the squared distance between the last two sorted points (`p2`).
    - Since the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes and the square is guaranteed to be valid, the distance between the first two points and the last two points should be equal (as they represent the sides of the square).

4. **Calculating Area:**
    - The area of the square is calculated by taking the square root of `p1` (or `p2`), which gives the side length of the square, and then squaring it.
    - The area is then printed.

5. **Output:**
    - The program prints the area of the square for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Area Calculation:**
    - The current implementation calculates the area incorrectly. Instead of taking the square root of `p1` (or `p2`) and squaring it to get the area, it multiplies the square roots of `p1` and `p2`. This is incorrect because the area of a square is the side length squared, not the product of two side lengths.
    - The correct calculation should be `res = int(math.sqrt(p1) ** 2)` or simply `res = p1` since `p1` is already the squared side length.

### Corrected Code:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        coord = sorted(coord)
        p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
        res = p1  # Correct calculation of area
        print(res)
        n -= 1
```

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the area calculation, the original program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
