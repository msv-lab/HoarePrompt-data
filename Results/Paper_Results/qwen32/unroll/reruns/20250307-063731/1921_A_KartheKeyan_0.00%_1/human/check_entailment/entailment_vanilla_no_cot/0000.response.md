Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the calculation of the area of the square. Specifically, the program calculates the product of the square roots of the squared distances between two pairs of adjacent points, which is not the correct approach to determine the area of the square.

To find the area of the square, you should:

1. Sort the coordinates.
2. Calculate the distance between two adjacent points (which will be the side length of the square).
3. Square this distance to get the area.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        coord = sorted(coord)
        # Calculate the distance between two adjacent points
        side_length = math.sqrt((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2)
        # Calculate the area of the square
        area = int(side_length ** 2)
        print(area)
        n -= 1

func()
```

This corrected program sorts the coordinates and calculates the side length of the square by finding the distance between two adjacent points, then squares this side length to find the area.
