Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each of the following t test cases consists of four lines, with each line containing two integers x_i and y_i such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. These integers represent the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. `n` is 0.**

Natural language: The variable `n` has been decremented to 0 after processing all test cases. The variable `t` and the test case coordinates remain unchanged.
