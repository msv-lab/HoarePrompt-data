### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Let's break down the logic and check if it aligns with the problem description.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four lines, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of the square.

2. **Coordinate Storage and Sorting:**
   - The coordinates are stored in a list called `coord`.
   - The list of coordinates is then sorted. Sorting the coordinates should help in identifying the correct pairs of corners to calculate the side length of the square.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the squared distances between the first two sorted coordinates (`p1`) and the last two sorted coordinates (`p2`).
   - It then calculates the side length of the square by taking the square root of `p1` and `p2` and multiplying these two values to get the area. However, this step is incorrect. The correct approach is to take the square root of either `p1` or `p2` (since both should be equal for a square) and then square it to get the area.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated area for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
- The formula `res = abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))` is incorrect for calculating the area of the square. Since `p1` and `p2` are the squared distances between pairs of corners, the correct area should be `(math.sqrt(p1)) ** 2` or `(math.sqrt(p2)) ** 2`.

### Corrected Formula:
- The correct formula to calculate the area of the square should be `res = (math.sqrt(p1)) ** 2` or `res = (math.sqrt(p2)) ** 2`, as `p1` and `p2` should be equal for a square.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the formula for calculating the area, the program is not correct as it stands.

**Correctness: False**
