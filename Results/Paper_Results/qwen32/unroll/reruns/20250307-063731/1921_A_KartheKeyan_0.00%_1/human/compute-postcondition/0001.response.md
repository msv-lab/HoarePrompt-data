The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code will read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is 0, but this value will be overwritten by the user input.

The values of `t` and the coordinates `x_i` and `y_i` provided in the initial state are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each of the following t test cases consists of four lines, with each line containing two integers x_i and y_i such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. These integers represent the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. `n` is an input integer.**
