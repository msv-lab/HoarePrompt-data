You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers as input. It processes the list `a` and the integer `k` to determine the maximum number of elements that can be "sunk" based on the given conditions. The function returns the count of these sunk elements, stored in the variable `sunks`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for handling attacks on the first and last ships is flawed, and it does not correctly account for when the Kraken has no more attacks left (`k == 0`).

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

### Test Case:
```
1
5 20
2 7 1 8 2
```

### Expected Output:
```
5
```

### Explanation of Expected Output:
- The Kraken attacks the first ship (2), reducing its durability to 0. Ships left: [7, 1, 8, 2]. Sunk: 1.
- The Kraken attacks the last ship (2), reducing its durability to 0. Ships left: [7, 1, 8]. Sunk: 2.
- The Kraken attacks the first ship (7), reducing its durability to 0. Ships left: [1, 8]. Sunk: 3.
- The Kraken attacks the last ship (8), reducing its durability to 0. Ships left: [1]. Sunk: 4.
- The Kraken attacks the first ship (1), reducing its durability to 0. Ships left: []. Sunk: 5.

### Actual Output from the Program:
The program may not correctly handle this case because it does not properly account for the scenario where the Kraken can still attack but the durability of the first or last ship is exactly enough to be sunk in the next attack. The logic for reducing durability and checking if a ship is sunk is flawed, and it may break out of the loop prematurely.

### Specific Issue in the Code:
- The condition `if k >= a[l] * 2` and `if k >= a[r] * 2` are used to check if the Kraken can sink both the first and last ships in one attack. However, this does not correctly handle the case where the durability of the first or last ship is exactly enough to be sunk in the next attack.
- The condition `elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k` and `elif a[r] * 2 == k` are used to check if the Kraken can sink one ship and have exactly one attack left, but these conditions are not correctly implemented and may cause the program to break out of the loop prematurely.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, and it may break out of the loop prematurely or incorrectly count the number of ships sunk. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
