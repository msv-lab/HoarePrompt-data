The `while` loop condition is `l <= r`. To ensure that the loop executes at least once, we need to make sure that the condition `l <= r` is true right before the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1`

For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. Since `r` is defined as `n - 1`, and `n` is at least 1 (as per the constraints `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`), `r` will be at least 0. Therefore, `l` (which is 0) will always be less than or equal to `r` (which is at least 0).

Thus, no adjustment is needed for `l` and `r` to ensure the loop executes at least once. The initial state already satisfies the condition `l <= r`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1. `sunks` is 0.**
