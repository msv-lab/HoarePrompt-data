Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for handling the attacks and decrementing the durability of the ships is flawed. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Handling of Equal Durabilities**: The code does not correctly handle the case when the durability of the first and last ships are equal. It should decrement both ships' durability by 1 in each attack cycle until one of them sinks.

2. **Breaking Out of the Loop Prematurely**: The code breaks out of the loop too early in some cases, not allowing all the attacks to be processed.

3. **Incorrect Condition for Sinking Ships**: The conditions for sinking the ships are not correctly checked. For example, when `a[l] * 2 == k` or `a[r] * 2 == k`, it should sink the ship and continue processing, not break out of the loop.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `k` is very large compared to the total durability of the ships.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1` that should handle the problem correctly:

```python
def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    
    while l <= r and k > 0:
        if a[l] == 0:
            l += 1
            continue
        if a[r] == 0:
            r -= 1
            continue
        
        if a[l] <= a[r]:
            if k >= a[l]:
                k -= a[l]
                a[l] = 0
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            else:
                a[l] -= k
                k = 0
        else:
            if k >= a[r]:
                k -= a[r]
                a[r] = 0
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            else:
                a[r] -= k
                k = 0
                
    return sunks
```

This corrected version ensures that the Kraken attacks the ships in the correct order and decrements their durability correctly until either all ships are sunk or all attacks are used up.
