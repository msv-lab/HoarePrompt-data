Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers as input. It processes the list `a` and the integer `k` to determine the maximum number of elements that can be "sunk" based on the given conditions. The function returns the count of these sunk elements, stored in the variable `sunks`.**
