You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers as input. It processes the list `a` and the integer `k` to determine the maximum number of elements that can be "sunk" based on the given conditions. The function returns the count of these sunk elements, stored in the variable `sunks`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The Kraken attacks ships in a specific pattern: first the first ship, then the last ship, and continues this pattern until all ships have sunk or the specified number of attacks (`k`) have been made. Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes the left (`l`) and right (`r`) pointers to the start and end of the list of ships' durability, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships that have sunk.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l <= r` and there are remaining attacks (`k > 0`).
   - If `l == r`, it means there's only one ship left. The program checks if the remaining attacks (`k`) are sufficient to sink this ship. If so, it increments the `sunks` counter and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `a[l] <= a[r]`, it checks if the remaining attacks (`k`) are sufficient to sink the first ship (`a[l]`) and then the last ship (`a[r]`). If so, it updates the durability of the last ship, checks if it has sunk, and updates the pointers and counters accordingly.
   - If `a[r] < a[l]`, it performs a similar check but for the last ship first.
   - If the remaining attacks are not sufficient to sink both ships in the current iteration, the loop breaks.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Handling of Single Ship**:
   - When `l == r`, the program correctly checks if the remaining attacks can sink the last ship. However, it incorrectly breaks out of the loop after incrementing the `sunks` counter, even if there are more attacks left (`k > 0`). This can lead to incorrect results if there are additional attacks that could sink other ships.
   
2. **Handling of Remaining Attacks**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the remaining attacks are exactly enough to sink a ship but not enough to proceed to the next iteration. For example, if `k == a[l] * 2 - 1`, it increments the `sunks` counter and breaks out of the loop, but it should continue to the next iteration since there's still one attack left.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the number of attacks (`k`) is very large compared to the number of ships and their durability. This can lead to incorrect results if the program does not correctly account for the remaining attacks after sinking ships.

### Correctness:
Given the identified issues, the program does not correctly handle all edge cases and can produce incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
