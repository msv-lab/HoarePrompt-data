Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array), `k` (a positive integer representing the duration of the game), `PB` (a positive integer representing Bodya's starting position), `PS` (a positive integer representing Sasha's starting position), and `p` (a list of `n` integers representing the permutation). It also accepts another parameter `a` (a list of `n` integers representing the array). Based on these inputs, the function determines the outcome of the game and returns the result.**
