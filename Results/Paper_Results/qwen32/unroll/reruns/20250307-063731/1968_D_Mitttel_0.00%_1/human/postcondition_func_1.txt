The function `calculate_score` takes an integer `start_pos` as input, which must be between 1 and the length of the permutation `p` and the array `a`. It calculates a `score` by traversing the permutation starting from `start_pos`, adding values from `a` at each step. If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score of the cycle and uses it to efficiently compute the final score for the remaining steps. The function returns the computed `score`.
