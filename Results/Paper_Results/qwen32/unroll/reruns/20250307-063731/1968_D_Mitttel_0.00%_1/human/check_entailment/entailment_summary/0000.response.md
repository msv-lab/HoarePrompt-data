### Reasoning:

The provided Python program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `calculate_score`, and `func_2`. Let's analyze each function to determine if they collectively meet the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the length of the permutation `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions `PB` and `PS` for Bodya and Sasha, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha by calling `calculate_score` with their respective starting positions.
   - It then compares the scores and returns 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, and 'Draw' if the scores are equal.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position `start_pos`.
   - It initializes the score to 0 and uses a dictionary `visited` to keep track of the positions visited and the number of steps taken to reach them.
   - It iterates up to `k` steps, adding the corresponding value from `a` to the score at each step.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., a position is revisited), it calculates the score of the cycle and uses it to efficiently compute the final score for the remaining steps.
   - It handles both the case where the player stays within the cycle and the case where the player completes full cycles and has some remaining steps to take.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it parses the input to extract `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters to determine the result for each test case and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of `calculate_score`**:
  - The function correctly handles the traversal of the permutation and the calculation of scores.
  - It efficiently handles cycles by calculating the score of the cycle and using it to determine the final score for the remaining steps.
  - The use of a dictionary to track visited positions ensures that cycles are detected correctly.

- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and returns the appropriate result.
  - It relies on `calculate_score` to compute the scores accurately.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly reads and parses the input for multiple test cases.
  - It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results as required.

### Conclusion:

All three functions work together to correctly determine the winner of the game for each test case based on the given rules. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
