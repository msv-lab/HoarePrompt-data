Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a critical issue in the `func_1` function where the `calculate_score` function is called without passing the necessary arguments `k`, `p`, and `a`. As a result, the `calculate_score` function does not have access to these variables, and it will fail to compute the scores correctly.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):
    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB, k, p, a)
    sasha_score = calculate_score(PS, k, p, a)
    if bodya_score > sasha_score:
        return 'Bodya'
    elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Draw'
```

With this correction, the program should work as intended.
