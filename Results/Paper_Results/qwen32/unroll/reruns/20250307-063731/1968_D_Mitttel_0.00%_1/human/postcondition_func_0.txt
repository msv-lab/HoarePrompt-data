The function `func_1` determines the winner of a game between Bodya and Sasha based on their scores, which are calculated from their starting positions `PB` and `PS` within a permutation `p` and an array `a`. It returns 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, and 'Draw' if both scores are equal.
