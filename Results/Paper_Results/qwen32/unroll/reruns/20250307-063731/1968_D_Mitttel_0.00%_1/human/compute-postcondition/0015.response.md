The code calculates the remainder of `remaining_steps` divided by `cycle_length` and assigns it to `remainder_steps`. The other variables (`cycle_score`, `cycle_pos`, `remaining_steps`, `full_cycles`) are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`cycle_score` is the sum of the values from `a` at the positions specified by the cycle, `cycle_pos` is the starting position of the cycle (`current_pos` at the start of the loop), `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`.**
