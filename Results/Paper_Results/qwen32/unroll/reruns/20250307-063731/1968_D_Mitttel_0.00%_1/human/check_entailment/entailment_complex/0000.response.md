### Reasoning:

The provided program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `calculate_score`, and `func_2`. Let's analyze each function in detail to ensure they collectively meet the problem description:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - **Purpose**: To determine the winner of the game based on the scores of Bodya and Sasha.
    - **Logic**: It calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function. It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").
    - **Correctness**: This function correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the scores.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
    - **Purpose**: To compute the score for a player starting from a given position.
    - **Logic**: 
        - It traverses the permutation starting from the given position.
        - It keeps track of the score by adding values from the array `a` at each step.
        - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the player revisits a position), it calculates the score of the cycle and uses it to efficiently compute the final score for the remaining steps.
    - **Correctness**: This function correctly handles both the traversal and cycle detection, ensuring the score is computed accurately.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
    - **Purpose**: To read multiple test cases from standard input, process each test case, and print the results.
    - **Logic**:
        - It reads the number of test cases.
        - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
        - It calls `func_1` to determine the result for each test case and stores the results.
        - Finally, it prints all the results.
    - **Correctness**: This function correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Each function performs its designated task accurately, and the overall program correctly processes multiple test cases.

**Correctness: True**
