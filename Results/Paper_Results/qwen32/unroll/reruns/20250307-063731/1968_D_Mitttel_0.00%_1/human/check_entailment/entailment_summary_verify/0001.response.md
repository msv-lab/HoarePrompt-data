Let's carefully analyze the provided code and verify if it correctly solves the problem as described in the problem statement.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Main Function (`func_1`)

- **Purpose**: This function calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha and determines the winner.
- **Implementation**:
  - It calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions.
  - It compares the scores and returns "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison.
- **Issues**:
  - The function `calculate_score` is called with the arguments `PB` and `PS`, which are the starting positions. However, the function `calculate_score` also requires the permutation `p` and the array `a` to compute the scores correctly. Currently, these are not being passed to `calculate_score`.
  - The current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect because it does not pass the necessary parameters to `calculate_score`.

#### Score Calculation (`calculate_score`)

- **Purpose**: This function calculates the score for a given starting position, considering cycles in the permutation.
- **Implementation**:
  - It initializes `score` to 0 and `current_pos` to the starting position.
  - It uses a dictionary `visited` to track visited positions and detect cycles.
  - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the cycle and the remaining steps outside the cycle.
  - It correctly handles the case where `k` is greater than the length of the sequence before a cycle is detected.
- **Issues**:
  - The function is designed to be called with the permutation `p` and the array `a`, but these are not being passed from `func_1`.

#### Input Reading (`func_2`)

- **Purpose**: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input and computes the results.
- **Implementation**:
  - It reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the result using `func_1`.
  - Finally, it prints all the results.
- **Issues**:
  - The function `func_1` is called without passing the necessary parameters `p` and `a` to `calculate_score`.

### Verification

- **Input Handling**: The function `func_2` correctly reads and processes the input for each test case.
- **Score Calculation**: The function `calculate_score` is correctly implemented to handle cycles and compute scores, but it requires the permutation `p` and the array `a` as parameters.
- **Main Function**: The function `func_1` is incorrectly implemented because it does not pass the necessary parameters to `calculate_score`.

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect due to the improper passing of parameters from `func_1` to `calculate_score`. The function `func_1` should be modified to pass the permutation `p` and the array `a` to `calculate_score`.

### Corrected Code Snippet for `func_1`

```python
def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):
    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB, p, a)
    sasha_score = calculate_score(PS, p, a)
    if bodya_score > sasha_score:
        return 'Bodya'
    elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Draw'
```

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
