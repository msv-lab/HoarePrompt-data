Postcondition: **`score`, `current_pos`, `steps`, `visited`, `cycle_start` are variables. If `cycle_start` is not -1, `cycle_score` is the sum of the values from `a` at the positions specified by the cycle, `cycle_pos` is the starting position of the cycle (`current_pos` at the start of the loop), `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`, and `score` is updated by adding `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus the sum of the values from `a` at the positions specified by the first `remainder_steps` of the cycle to it. If `cycle_start` is -1, no changes are made to the variables.**
