Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed has issues with the argument passing and handling of the `k` parameter in the `calculate_score` function.

1. **Incorrect Argument Passing in `func_1`:**
   - The `calculate_score` function is called without passing the `k`, `p`, and `a` parameters. This means that the `calculate_score` function does not have the necessary information to compute the score correctly for the given number of steps `k` and the permutation `p` and array `a`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of `k` in `calculate_score`:**
   - The `calculate_score` function does not correctly use the `k` parameter because it is not passed as an argument. The function needs to know the exact number of steps `k` to ensure that the scoring process runs for exactly `k` turns.

The corrected version provided in the original assessment addresses these issues by ensuring that `calculate_score` is called with the necessary parameters (`k`, `p`, and `a`), and that these parameters are correctly used within the function.

Thus, the original assessment correctly identifies the problems in the program.

Final: **False**
