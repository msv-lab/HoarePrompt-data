The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter. This list is assigned to the variable `data`. The values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged unless they are specifically modified in subsequent code, which is not shown here. The `data` variable now holds the input values as strings.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array; `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game; `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions respectively, and both `PB` and `PS` are within the range [1, n]; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.**
