Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis

The task involves determining the winner of a game between Bodya and Sasha. Both players start at different positions in a permutation and move according to the rules of the game. The goal is to compute their scores after `k` turns and determine the winner.

### Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):
    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB)
    sasha_score = calculate_score(PS)
    if bodya_score > sasha_score:
        return 'Bodya'
    elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Draw'
```
- **Issue Identified:** The function `calculate_score` is called without passing the `k`, `p`, and `a` parameters. This means the function won't be able to compute the scores correctly because it needs these parameters to determine the score based on the permutation and the array over `k` turns.

#### Function `calculate_score`:
```python
def calculate_score(start_pos):
    score = 0
    current_pos = start_pos
    steps = 0
    visited = {}
    cycle_start = -1
    while steps < k:
        if current_pos in visited:
            cycle_start = visited[current_pos]
            break
        visited[current_pos] = steps
        score += a[current_pos - 1]
        steps += 1
        if steps >= k:
            return score
        current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    if cycle_start != -1:
        cycle_length = steps - cycle_start
        cycle_score = 0
        cycle_pos = current_pos
        for _ in range(cycle_length):
            cycle_score += a[cycle_pos - 1]
            cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos - 1]
        remaining_steps = k - steps
        full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
        remainder_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length
        score += full_cycles * cycle_score
        for _ in range(remainder_steps):
            score += a[current_pos - 1]
            current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    return score
```
- **Issue Identified:** The function `calculate_score` does not take `k`, `p`, and `a` as parameters. This means it cannot access these variables, and thus, it cannot compute the score correctly.

### Annotated Code Analysis

The annotated code provides a detailed state description for each function but does not address the critical issue of missing parameters in the function calls and definitions.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the functions with the necessary parameters:

```python
def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):
    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB, k, p, a)
    sasha_score = calculate_score(PS, k, p, a)
    if bodya_score > sasha_score:
        return 'Bodya'
    elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Draw'

def calculate_score(start_pos, k, p, a):
    score = 0
    current_pos = start_pos
    steps = 0
    visited = {}
    cycle_start = -1
    while steps < k:
        if current_pos in visited:
            cycle_start = visited[current_pos]
            break
        visited[current_pos] = steps
        score += a[current_pos - 1]
        steps += 1
        if steps >= k:
            return score
        current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    if cycle_start != -1:
        cycle_length = steps - cycle_start
        cycle_score = 0
        cycle_pos = current_pos
        for _ in range(cycle_length):
            cycle_score += a[cycle_pos - 1]
            cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos - 1]
        remaining_steps = k - steps
        full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
        remainder_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length
        score += full_cycles * cycle_score
        for _ in range(remainder_steps):
            score += a[current_pos - 1]
            current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    return score
```

### Final Evaluation

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program is incorrect due to the missing parameters in the function calls and definitions. The corrected version of the program addresses these issues and should work as intended.

**Final: False** (The given program is incorrect without the necessary parameter corrections.)
