### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case, extracting `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the result in a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result from `results`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function and compares them.
   - It correctly returns "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison of the scores.

3. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position `start_pos`.
   - It keeps track of the visited positions to detect cycles in the permutation.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the full cycles and the remaining steps outside the cycle.
   - This approach ensures that the function handles large values of `k` efficiently by recognizing and utilizing cycles in the permutation.

### Correctness:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input, calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha, and determines the winner or if it's a draw. The cycle detection mechanism in `calculate_score` ensures that the program can handle large values of `k` efficiently.

Thus, the program is correct based on the given problem description and the provided execution states.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
