Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array; `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game; `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions respectively, and both `PB` and `PS` are within the range [1, n]; `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation; `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**

In simple terms, the only change is that the variable `index` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
