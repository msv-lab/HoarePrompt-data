The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`, which iterates over the `results` list. Therefore, we need to ensure that the `results` list contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is the length of the permutation and array from the last iteration, `k` is the duration of the game from the last iteration, `PB` and `PS` are Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions from the last iteration, `p` is the permutation from the last iteration, `a` is the array from the last iteration, `data` is the same list of strings as in the initial state, `index` points right after the last read values in `data`, `t` is the same as in the initial state, `results` is a list containing at least one element**
