To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand how the variables are updated within the loop and how they affect the overall state.

The loop runs `t` times, and in each iteration, it:
1. Reads `n`, `k`, `PB`, and `PS` from the `data` list, starting from the current `index`.
2. Increments `index` by 4 to move past these four values.
3. Reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` from the `data` list, starting from the current `index`.
4. Increments `index` by `n` to move past the permutation and then again by `n` to move past the array.
5. Calls `func_1` with the read values and appends the result to the `results` list.

After all iterations, the `index` will have moved past all the values read in the loop. The `results` list will contain the results of each call to `func_1`. The values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` will reflect the last iteration's values, and `index` will point to the position right after the last read values.

Given that the state of other variables not affected by the loop (like `data` and `t`) remains unchanged, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`n` is the length of the permutation and array from the last iteration, `k` is the duration of the game from the last iteration, `PB` and `PS` are Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions from the last iteration, `p` is the permutation from the last iteration, `a` is the array from the last iteration, `data` is the same list of strings as in the initial state, `index` points right after the last read values in `data`, `t` is the same as in the initial state, `results` is a list containing the results of each call to `func_1`.**
