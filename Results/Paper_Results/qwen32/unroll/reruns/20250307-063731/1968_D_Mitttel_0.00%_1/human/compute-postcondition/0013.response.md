The code assigns the value of `k - steps` to the variable `remaining_steps`. The variables `cycle_score` and `cycle_pos` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`cycle_score` is the sum of the values from `a` at the positions specified by the cycle, `cycle_pos` is the starting position of the cycle (`current_pos` at the start of the loop), `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`.**
