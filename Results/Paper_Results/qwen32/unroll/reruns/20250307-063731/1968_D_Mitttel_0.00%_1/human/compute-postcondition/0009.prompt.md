Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the length of the permutation and array from the last iteration, `k` is the duration of the game from the last iteration, `PB` and `PS` are Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions from the last iteration, `p` is the permutation from the last iteration, `a` is the array from the last iteration, `data` is the same list of strings as in the initial state, `index` points right after the last read values in `data`, `t` is the same as in the initial state, `results` is a list containing the results of each call to `func_1`.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
