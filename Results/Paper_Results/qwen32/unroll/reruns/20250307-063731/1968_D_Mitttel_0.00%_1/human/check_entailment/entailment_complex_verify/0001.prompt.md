You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `calculate_score` takes an integer `start_pos` as input, which must be between 1 and the length of the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and verify if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Main Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The main function `func_1` takes the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

2. **Score Calculation (`calculate_score`)**:
   - The `calculate_score` function calculates the score for a given starting position.
   - It initializes `score` to 0 and `current_pos` to the starting position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to track visited positions and detect cycles.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the cycle and the remaining steps outside the cycle.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the number of steps `k` is greater than the length of the sequence before a cycle is detected.
   - It also correctly handles the case where a cycle is detected and calculates the score for the remaining steps by using the cycle score.

3. **Input Reading (`func_2`)**:
   - The `func_2` function reads the input from standard input.
   - It processes each test case, calculates the result using `func_1`, and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints all the results.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.
- The `calculate_score` function correctly calculates the score for a player given their starting position, taking into account cycles in the permutation.
- The program efficiently handles the constraints provided (up to 10^4 test cases with a total of up to 2 * 10^5 elements in the permutation and array).

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to be correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
