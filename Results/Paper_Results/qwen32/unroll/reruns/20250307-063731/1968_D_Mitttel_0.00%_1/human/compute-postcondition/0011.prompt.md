You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array, k is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, PB and PS are positive integers representing Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions respectively, and both PB and PS are within the range [1, n]. p is a list of n integers representing the permutation, and a is a list of n integers representing the array.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        
        PB = int(data[index + 2])
        
        PS = int(data[index + 3])
        
        index += 4
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `n` is the length of the permutation and array from the last iteration, `k` is the duration of the game from the last iteration, `PB` and `PS` are Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions from the last iteration, `p` is the permutation from the last iteration, `a` is the array from the last iteration, `data` is the same list of strings as in the initial state, `index` points right after the last read values in `data`, `t` is the same as in the initial state, `results` is a list containing the results of each call to `func_1`.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `n` is the length of the permutation and array from the last iteration, `k` is the duration of the game from the last iteration, `PB` and `PS` are Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions from the last iteration, `p` is the permutation from the last iteration, `a` is the array from the last iteration, `data` is the same list of strings as in the initial state, `index` points right after the last read values in `data`, `t` is the same as in the initial state, `results` is a list containing the results of each call to `func_1` and its contents have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts five parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array), `k` (a positive integer representing the duration of the game), `PB` (a positive integer representing Bodya's starting position), `PS` (a positive integer representing Sasha's starting position), and `p` (a list of `n` integers representing the permutation). It also accepts another parameter `a` (a list of `n` integers representing the array). Based on these inputs, the function determines the outcome of the game and returns the result.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
