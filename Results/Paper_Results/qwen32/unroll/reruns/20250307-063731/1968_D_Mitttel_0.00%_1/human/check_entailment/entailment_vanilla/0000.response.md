### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and verify if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Main Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The main function `func_1` takes the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

2. **Score Calculation (`calculate_score`)**:
   - The `calculate_score` function calculates the score for a given starting position.
   - It initializes `score` to 0 and `current_pos` to the starting position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to track visited positions and detect cycles.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the cycle and the remaining steps outside the cycle.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the number of steps `k` is greater than the length of the sequence before a cycle is detected.
   - It also correctly handles the case where a cycle is detected and calculates the score for the remaining steps by using the cycle score.

3. **Input Reading (`func_2`)**:
   - The `func_2` function reads the input from standard input.
   - It processes each test case, calculates the result using `func_1`, and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints all the results.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.
- The `calculate_score` function correctly calculates the score for a player given their starting position, taking into account cycles in the permutation.
- The program efficiently handles the constraints provided (up to 10^4 test cases with a total of up to 2 * 10^5 elements in the permutation and array).

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to be correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
