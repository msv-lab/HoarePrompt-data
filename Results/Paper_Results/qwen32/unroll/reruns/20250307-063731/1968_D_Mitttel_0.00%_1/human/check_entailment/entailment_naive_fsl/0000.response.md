Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the function `func_1` and the function `calculate_score`. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not pass the correct arguments to `calculate_score`, and the `calculate_score` function does not use the `k` parameter correctly.

Here are the issues in detail:

1. **Incorrect Argument Passing in `func_1`:**
   The `calculate_score` function is called without the `k`, `p`, and `a` parameters. The `calculate_score` function needs these parameters to compute the score correctly.

2. **Incorrect Handling of `k` in `calculate_score`:**
   The `calculate_score` function does not correctly use the `k` parameter. The function should take `k` as an argument and ensure that the scoring process runs for exactly `k` steps. The current implementation of `calculate_score` does not correctly handle the `k` parameter in the context of the game rules.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` and `calculate_score` functions:

```python
def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):
    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB, k, p, a)
    sasha_score = calculate_score(PS, k, p, a)
    if bodya_score > sasha_score:
        return 'Bodya'
    elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Draw'

def calculate_score(start_pos, k, p, a):
    score = 0
    current_pos = start_pos
    steps = 0
    visited = {}
    cycle_start = -1
    while steps < k:
        if current_pos in visited:
            cycle_start = visited[current_pos]
            break
        visited[current_pos] = steps
        score += a[current_pos - 1]
        steps += 1
        if steps >= k:
            return score
        current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    if cycle_start != -1:
        cycle_length = steps - cycle_start
        cycle_score = 0
        cycle_pos = current_pos
        for _ in range(cycle_length):
            cycle_score += a[cycle_pos - 1]
            cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos - 1]
        remaining_steps = k - steps
        full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
        remainder_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length
        score += full_cycles * cycle_score
        for _ in range(remainder_steps):
            score += a[current_pos - 1]
            current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    return score
```

In the corrected version, the `calculate_score` function now takes `k`, `p`, and `a` as arguments, and `func_1` correctly passes these arguments to `calculate_score`. This ensures that the scoring process is correctly computed for exactly `k` steps.
