The given loop simply iterates over the `results` list and prints each element. Since the loop does not modify any of the variables `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `data`, `index`, or `t`, these variables will remain unchanged. The only change is that the contents of `results` will have been printed.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the permutation and array from the last iteration, `k` is the duration of the game from the last iteration, `PB` and `PS` are Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions from the last iteration, `p` is the permutation from the last iteration, `a` is the array from the last iteration, `data` is the same list of strings as in the initial state, `index` points right after the last read values in `data`, `t` is the same as in the initial state, `results` is a list containing the results of each call to `func_1` and its contents have been printed.**
