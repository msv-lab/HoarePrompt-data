### Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to systematically analyze each component based on the problem description and the annotated code. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Main Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game by comparing the scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It correctly calls the `calculate_score` function for both players and compares the returned scores.
   - Based on the comparison, it returns "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" as required.

2. **Score Calculation (`calculate_score`)**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to track the positions visited and the step count at which they were visited. This helps in detecting cycles.
   - If a position is revisited, it indicates the start of a cycle. The function then calculates the score for the cycle and the remaining steps outside the cycle.
   - The function handles the scenario where the number of steps `k` is greater than the length of the sequence before a cycle is detected, and it also handles cycles correctly by calculating the score for the remaining steps using the cycle score.
   - The function correctly adds the score for each step and updates the position based on the permutation `p`.

3. **Input Reading (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input from standard input, processes each test case, and stores the results.
   - It correctly parses the input data and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.
- The `calculate_score` function correctly calculates the score for a player given their starting position, taking into account cycles in the permutation.
- The program efficiently handles the constraints provided (up to 10^4 test cases with a total of up to 2 * 10^5 elements in the permutation and array).

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to be correct and efficiently solves the problem as described. The annotations provide a clear and detailed explanation of the program's behavior at key points, which aligns with the expected behavior based on the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
