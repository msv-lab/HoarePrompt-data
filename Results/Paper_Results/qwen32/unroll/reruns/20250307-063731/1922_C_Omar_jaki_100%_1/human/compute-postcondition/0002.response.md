The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since `t` is already within this range, it ensures that `t` is greater than 0, and thus the loop can execute.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
