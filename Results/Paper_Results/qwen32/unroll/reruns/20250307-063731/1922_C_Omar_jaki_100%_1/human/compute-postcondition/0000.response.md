The given code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer. This function is not used in the provided code snippet and does not change any existing variables. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the introduction of the lambda function `r`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, a is a list of n integers such that 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and for each query, x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Additionally, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely. `r` is a lambda function that reads and maps input to integers.**
