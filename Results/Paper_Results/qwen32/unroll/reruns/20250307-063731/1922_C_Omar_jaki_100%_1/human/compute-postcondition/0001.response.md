The code snippet reads an integer `t` using the lambda function `r`. The value of `t` represents the number of test cases. No other variables are modified in this snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, a is a list of n integers such that 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and for each query, x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Additionally, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely. `r` is a lambda function that reads and maps input to integers. `t` has been assigned the value from the input.**
