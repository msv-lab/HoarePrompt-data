You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and x such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and q contains between 1 and 100 tuples.
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if (w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1) :
        M += [w]
    #State: `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list that contains one element `w` if `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list. A TypeError is raised.
    i = 1
    while i < w:
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: M = [[10, 2, 5]]
    return M
    #The program returns the matrix M which is [[10, 2, 5]]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `q` and an integer `x`. Despite the annotations, the function does not utilize the contents of `q` or `x` in its logic. It always returns a predefined list `M` which is `[[10, 2, 5]]`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
The problem involves determining the number of valid `k` values for which a given position `n` in a line results in a specific number `x` during a "settling" process. The settling process repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and `k` must be greater than 1.

### Key Points:
1. **Settling Process**: 
   - The first `k` positions are numbered `1, 2, ..., k`.
   - The next `k-2` positions are numbered `k-1, k-2, ..., 2`.
   - This pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   
2. **Objective**:
   - Given a position `n` and a number `x`, find all valid `k` values such that the number at position `n` is `x`.
   
3. **Constraints**:
   - `1 <= t <= 100` (number of test cases)
   - `1 <= x < n <= 10^9` (position and number)

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program aims to find all valid `k` values for each test case. Let's break it down:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The program checks if `y = n + x` is odd. If it is, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is because the settling process only works for even `y`.

3. **Finding Valid `k` Values**:
   - The program calls `func_1` to find potential `k` values based on `(y - 2) // 2` and `x`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it calls `func_1` again with `(n - x) // 2` and `x` and adds the results.
   - It removes duplicates from the list of potential `k` values and prints the count.

4. **`func_1` Function**:
   - This function finds divisors of `q` that are at least `x - 1`.
   - It checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and adds it to the list if it is a valid divisor.
   - It iterates through numbers from `1` to the square root of `q`, adding divisors to the list if they are at least `x - 1`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly identifies the condition for `y` to be even, which is necessary for the settling process to work.
- The function `func_1` correctly finds divisors of `q` that are at least `x - 1`, which are potential values for `k`.
- The program handles the case where `n >= 3 * x - 2` by considering an additional set of potential `k` values.
- The program ensures that only unique `k` values are counted by converting the list to a set.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to find all valid `k` values for each test case based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
