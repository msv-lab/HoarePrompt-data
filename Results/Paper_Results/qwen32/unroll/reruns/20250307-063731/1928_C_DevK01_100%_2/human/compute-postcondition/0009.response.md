Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `q`, which is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `x`, which is an integer. The function always returns the matrix `M` which is [[10, 2, 5]], regardless of the input values.**
