Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code defines a function `func_1` that is used to find divisors of a number `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. The main logic in the program is based on calculating `y = n + x` and then checking if `y` is even. If `y` is odd, it prints `0` because it is impossible for `k` to fit under the given constraints when `y` is odd. If `y` is even, it calculates two potential sets of `k` values using `func_1`.

However, there are several issues with the logic:

1. The calculation of `y` and the condition `y % 2 != 0` are not directly related to the problem of finding valid `k` values. The problem requires understanding the periodic pattern of the sequence and checking if `x` can appear at position `n` for different values of `k`.

2. The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2`, but these calculations do not correctly map to the problem's requirements. Specifically, the function does not correctly determine the valid `k` values based on the described pattern.

3. The condition `if n >= 3 * x - 2` is not clearly derived from the problem description and seems arbitrary.

To illustrate the issue, let's consider a test case:

Input:
```
1
10 2
```

The expected output is `4` because `k` can be `2, 3, 5, 6`. However, the provided code does not correctly compute this. The code will likely not handle this case correctly due to the incorrect logic described above.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
