Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of possible values of `k` such that Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` fit the described pattern of "settling in the first-k-th position."

The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions and follows this sequence:
- The first `k` positions are numbered `1, 2, 3, ..., k`.
- The next `k-2` positions are numbered `k-1, k-2, ..., 2`.
- This pattern repeats.

Given `n` and `x`, we need to find the number of valid `k` values that satisfy the condition.

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calculates the number of valid `k` values.

#### Key Steps in the Program

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - It checks if `y = n + x` is even. If not, it prints `0` and moves to the next test case because the pattern cannot fit if `y` is odd.

3. **Finding Possible `k` Values:**
   - It computes `L1` using the function `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it also computes `L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)`.
   - It then removes duplicates from `L1` and prints the length of `L1`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It checks if `w = sqrt(q)` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it adds `w` to the list `M`.
   - It then iterates over all integers `i` from `1` to `w - 1` and checks if `i` or `q // i` are divisors of `q` and greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

### Correctness Analysis

Let's analyze if the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid `k` values:

- **Initial Check for Even `y`:**
  - The program correctly checks if `y = n + x` is even. If not, it prints `0` because the pattern cannot fit if `y` is odd.

- **Finding Divisors:**
  - The function `func_1` is supposed to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This is a correct approach to find possible values of `k` because `k` must be a divisor of `q` and greater than or equal to `x`.

- **Combining Results:**
  - The program combines results from two possible computations of `q` (`(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2`) if `n >= 3 * x - 2`. This is a correct approach to ensure all possible `k` values are considered.

- **Removing Duplicates:**
  - The program removes duplicates from the list of possible `k` values before counting them. This is necessary to avoid counting the same `k` multiple times.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the number of unique valid `k` values, which is the correct output for each test case.

### Conclusion

The program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints and examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
