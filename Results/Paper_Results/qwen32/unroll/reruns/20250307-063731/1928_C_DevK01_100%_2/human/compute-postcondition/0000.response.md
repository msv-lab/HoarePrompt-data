The code snippet initializes an empty list `M`. The initial state specifies that `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. The execution of the code does not affect `q` in any way, and `M` is simply initialized as an empty list.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is an empty list.**
