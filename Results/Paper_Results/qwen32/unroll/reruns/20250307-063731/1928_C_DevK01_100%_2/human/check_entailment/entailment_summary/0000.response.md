Reasoning:  
The provided execution summary indicates that the function `func_1` is not implemented correctly. According to the problem description, `func_1` should take two parameters `q` and `x`, and it should find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. However, the summary suggests that `func_1` always returns a predefined list `M` which is `[[10, 2, 5]]`, regardless of the inputs `q` and `x`. This means the function does not perform the required computation, leading to incorrect results for the test cases.

Given the incorrect implementation of `func_1`, the overall program cannot produce the correct output for the given problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
