Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list that contains one element `w` if `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list. A TypeError is raised.**
