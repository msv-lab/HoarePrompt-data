The provided code contains an error because `math.sqrt(q)` is not valid when `q` is a list of tuples. The `math.sqrt` function expects a single number, not a list or a tuple. Therefore, the code will raise a `TypeError`. However, since the task is to simulate the execution and provide the output state based on the given code, we will assume the intention was to apply `math.sqrt` to some element within the tuples, but given the code as is, the only change that would occur is an exception being raised, and the variables `q` and `M` would remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is an empty list; a TypeError is raised.**
