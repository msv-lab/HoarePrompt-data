Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. There are several issues with the logic and the implementation:

1. The function `func_1` is supposed to find divisors of a number `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, but it does not correctly handle the case when `i` is equal to `q // i` (which happens when `q` is a perfect square). This can lead to duplicate values in the list `M`.

2. The program checks if `y % 2 != 0` and immediately prints `0` if true. However, this check is not correct for the problem's requirements. The condition for the existence of `k` is more complex and involves checking the divisors of `(n + x - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2`.

3. The logic for combining the results from `func_1` is incorrect. The program should be checking the divisors of `(n + x - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` separately and ensuring that they satisfy the condition `k >= x`.

4. The program does not handle the case where `n < 3 * x - 2` correctly. It should only call `func_1` with `(n - x) // 2` if `n >= 3 * x - 2`.

5. The program does not correctly handle the case when `x == 1`. According to the problem statement, `k > 1` and `x < n`, so `x == 1` is always valid, but the program does not account for this properly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_1(q, x):
    M = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(q)) + 1):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M.add(i)
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M.add(q // i)
    return M

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    
    if x == 1:
        # If x is 1, k can be any number from 2 to n
        ans = n - 1
    else:
        # Check divisors of (n + x - 2) // 2
        if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
            L1 = func_1((n + x - 2) // 2, x)
            ans += len(L1)
        
        # Check divisors of (n - x) // 2 if n >= 3 * x - 2
        if n >= 3 * x - 2 and (n - x) % 2 == 0:
            L2 = func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
            ans += len(L2 - L1)  # Avoid double counting

    print(ans)
```

This corrected version handles the logic more accurately and should produce the correct results for the given problem.
