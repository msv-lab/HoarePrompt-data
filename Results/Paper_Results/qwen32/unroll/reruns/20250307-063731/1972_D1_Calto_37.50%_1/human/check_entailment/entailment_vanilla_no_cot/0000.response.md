Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_2` is intended to count the number of valid ordered pairs `(a, b)` for given `n` and `m`, but the logic implemented does not match the problem's requirements.

The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` needs to be checked for all pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`. However, the current implementation uses a different formula to calculate the count of valid pairs, which does not align with the problem's logic.

Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:

1. For each `b` from `1` to `m`, calculate `gcd(a, b)` for `a` from `1` to `n`.
2. Check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
3. Count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

The provided code does not follow this logic, hence it is incorrect for the given problem.
