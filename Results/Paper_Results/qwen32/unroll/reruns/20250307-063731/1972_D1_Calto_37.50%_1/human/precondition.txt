n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function gcd(a, b) is used to compute the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains the number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 10^4), and each of the following t lines contains two integers n and m. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.
