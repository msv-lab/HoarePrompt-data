Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the implementation of `func_2` does not correctly reflect the logic required to solve this problem.

The given `func_2` function seems to be following a different logic, as it calculates a count based on the formula `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`, which is not related to the problem's conditions. The final return statement also does not make sense in the context of the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b) is satisfied. This can be done using a nested loop where the outer loop iterates over a and the inner loop iterates over b.

The provided `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, which can be used in the correct implementation of the solution.

Given the incorrect implementation of `func_2`, the program is not correct for the problem described.

Correctness: **False**
