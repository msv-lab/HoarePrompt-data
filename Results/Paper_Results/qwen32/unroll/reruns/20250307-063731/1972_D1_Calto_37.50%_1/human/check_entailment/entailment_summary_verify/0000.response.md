Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions specified in the problem description.

Let's break down the issue:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This part of the code is correct.

2. **Function `func_2`**: The function `func_2` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the implementation is incorrect.

   - The function `func_2` does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Instead, it uses a different logic that involves calculating `x` and `y` based on `n` and `i`, and then updating `cnt` based on these values. This logic does not align with the problem requirements.

Let's consider the condition again:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\). This can be rewritten as:
\[ a = (k - 1) \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and checking the condition for each pair. The provided code does not do this.

To further illustrate the issue, let's consider the example provided in the problem description for \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):

- Valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2).
- The correct output for this test case is 3.

However, the provided code does not produce the correct output for this or other test cases. The function summary also does not match the expected behavior of the function `func_2`, as it suggests that the function returns `n + m - 2` unless `cnt` is 0, which is not consistent with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
