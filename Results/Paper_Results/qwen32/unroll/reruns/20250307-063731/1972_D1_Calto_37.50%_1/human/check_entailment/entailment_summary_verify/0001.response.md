### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Requirements:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - **`func_2(n, m)`**: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m` but does not use `func_1` at all. Instead, it performs a series of calculations that do not align with the problem requirements.

3. **Verification Against Problem Requirements:**
   - The logic in `func_2` does not check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it calculates `x` and `y` based on `i` and updates `cnt` with `x // y + (i > 1)`. This logic is unrelated to the problem statement.
   - The function summary provided states that `func_2` returns `n + m - 2` unless it evaluates to 0, in which case it returns 1. However, this does not correspond to the correct logic for counting the valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.

4. **Correctness:**
   - Given the mismatch between the problem statement and the implementation in `func_2`, the provided program is indeed incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct in stating that the provided program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
