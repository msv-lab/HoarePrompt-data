Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions specified in the problem description.

The function `func_1` correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to count the pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\). This simplifies to:
\[ a = (k - 1) \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

The current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition. Instead, it uses a different logic that does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the issue. For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the valid pairs are:
- (1, 1) because \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\)
- (2, 1) because \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\)
- (2, 2) because \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\)

The correct output for this test case is 3. However, the provided code does not produce the correct output for this or other test cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
