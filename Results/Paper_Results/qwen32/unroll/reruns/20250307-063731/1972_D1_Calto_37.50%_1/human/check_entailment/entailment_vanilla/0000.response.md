Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Code Analysis

The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m` but does not use `func_1` at all.

Let's examine `func_2(n, m)`:
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
- It iterates over `i` from 1 to `m-1` (not including `m`).
- For each `i`, it calculates `x` and `y`:
  - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
  - `y = i * i`
- It updates `cnt` by adding `x // y + (i > 1)`.
- If `cnt` is 0 after the loop, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements

The logic in `func_2` does not align with the problem requirements. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not checked in the provided code. The code seems to be implementing a different logic that does not match the problem statement.

### Correctness

Given the mismatch between the problem statement and the implementation in `func_2`, the provided program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
