### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the problem statement and compare it with the logic implemented in the code.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) but does not use `func_1` and instead implements a different logic.

Let's break down `func_2(n, m)`:
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
- It iterates over `i` from 1 to `m-1`.
- For each `i`, it calculates:
  - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
  - `y = i * i`
- It updates `cnt` by adding `x // y + (i > 1)`.
- If `cnt` is 0 after the loop, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

#### Verification Against Problem Requirements:
The logic in `func_2` does not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not checked. Instead, the code performs a series of calculations that do not relate to the problem's constraints.

#### Annotations Analysis:
The annotations provided in the annotated code describe the state of the program at key points but do not reflect the correct logic for solving the problem. The annotations state that `cnt` is ultimately `n + m - 2`, which is not a valid or relevant formula for counting the number of valid pairs based on the problem statement.

#### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch between the problem statement and the implementation in `func_2`, the provided program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
