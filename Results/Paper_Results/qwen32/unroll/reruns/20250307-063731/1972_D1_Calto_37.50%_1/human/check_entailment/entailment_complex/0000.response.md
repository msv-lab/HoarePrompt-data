Reasoning:  
The provided code and its annotated functions do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the requirements and the provided code to understand why.

### Problem Requirements:
- We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
  - 1 ≤ a ≤ n
  - 1 ≤ b ≤ m
  - a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

### Provided Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This part is correct.
- **Function `func_2`**: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) as per the problem statement. However, the logic inside `func_2` does not match the problem requirements. The function seems to be performing some unrelated calculations that do not align with the problem constraints or the desired output.

### Issues in `func_2`:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `m - 1` and calculates `x` and `y` based on `n` and `i`. These calculations do not directly relate to the gcd condition or the sum condition specified in the problem.
- The final count `cnt` is calculated as `n + m - 2` unless it is 0, in which case it returns 1. This logic is not consistent with the problem's requirements and does not correctly count the number of valid pairs (a, b).

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) within the given constraints and check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is satisfied. This can be done using a nested loop structure where we iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` and count the valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
Given that the provided `func_2` does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
