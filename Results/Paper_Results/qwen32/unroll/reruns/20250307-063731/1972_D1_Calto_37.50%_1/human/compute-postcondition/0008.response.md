Functionality: **The function `func_2` takes two positive integer parameters `n` and `m`. It performs a series of calculations and returns either 1 if the computed value `cnt` is 0, or the value of `cnt` itself if it is not 0. The value of `cnt` is ultimately `n + m - 2` unless it evaluates to 0, in which case the function returns 1.**
