To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the for loop can execute, let's analyze the loop head:

The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `m-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be greater than 1 because `range(1, m)` will generate no values if `m` is 1 or less.

Given that `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6`, the only variable we can adjust in the loop head is `m` to ensure the loop executes. The variable `n` and the initial value of `cnt` do not affect the execution of the loop.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `m` to be greater than 1. The values of `n` and `cnt` remain unchanged as they do not influence the loop's execution.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` must be greater than 1; `cnt` is 0**
