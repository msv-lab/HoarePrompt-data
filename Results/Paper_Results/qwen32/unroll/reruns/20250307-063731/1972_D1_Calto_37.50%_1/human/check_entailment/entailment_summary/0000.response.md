### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem statement and the provided functions to determine if the program is correct.

**Problem Statement Recap:**
- We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
  - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

**Function Analysis:**

**Function 1:**
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
```
- This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This is consistent with the problem description.

**Function 2:**
```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt
```
- This function is intended to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) according to the problem statement. However, the logic within this function does not align with the problem's requirements.
- Specifically, the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m-1` and computes `x` and `y` in a way that does not directly relate to checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The final return statement adjusts `cnt` to return 1 if it is 0, otherwise returns `cnt`. This adjustment does not make sense in the context of counting valid pairs as described in the problem.

**Verification:**
- The provided function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for all pairs (a, b).
- Therefore, the function does not solve the problem as intended.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because `func_2` does not properly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) as per the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
