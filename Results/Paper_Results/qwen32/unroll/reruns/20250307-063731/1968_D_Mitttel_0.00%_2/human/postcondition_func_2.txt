The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case includes parameters such as the length of the permutation and array `a`, the duration of the game, starting positions for Bodya and Sasha, a permutation list `p`, and an array `a`. For each test case, it computes and prints the result of a game based on the given rules involving the movement of Bodya and Sasha according to the permutation `p` for `k` steps and the values in array `a`.
