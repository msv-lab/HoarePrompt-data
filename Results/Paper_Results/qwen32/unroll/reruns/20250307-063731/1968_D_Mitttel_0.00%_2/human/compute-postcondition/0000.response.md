The provided code snippet only reads input from standard input and assigns it to the variable `input`. This action does not modify any of the existing variables `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, or `a`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array a, `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions respectively, such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n. `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of n integers representing the array a, where each element in p and a is a positive integer and 1 <= p_i <= n and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all valid indices i. `input` holds the input read from standard input.**
