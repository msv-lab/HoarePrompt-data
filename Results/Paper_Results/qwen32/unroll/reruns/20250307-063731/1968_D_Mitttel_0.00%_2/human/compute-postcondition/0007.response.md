To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the changes that occur within the loop. The loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, it processes a set of inputs to compute a result using the function `func_1`. The results are collected in the `results` list. 

Let's break down the changes:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are re-assigned in each iteration based on the input data.
   - `index` is incremented after each set of inputs is processed.
   - `results` accumulates the results from each iteration.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each iteration, the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are read from the `data` list starting from the current `index`.
   - The `index` is then incremented to point to the next set of inputs.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the current values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`, and the result is appended to the `results` list.

3. **Final Output State:**
   - After all iterations, `index` will point to a position in the `data` list that is `4 + 2*n` positions after its initial position for each iteration.
   - The `results` list will contain `t` results, one from each iteration.

Given the above, the output state after the loop finishes executing all iterations is:

Output State: **`index` is incremented by `4 + 2*n` for each iteration, and `results` contains `t` results from the function `func_1`.**
