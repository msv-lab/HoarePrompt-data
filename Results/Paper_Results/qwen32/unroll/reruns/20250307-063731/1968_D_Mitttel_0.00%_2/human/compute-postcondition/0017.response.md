The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `remainder_steps`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not affect the execution of the loop, we only need to adjust `remainder_steps` to ensure the loop can execute.

For the loop to execute, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `(k - 3) % 3` is greater than 0.

State: **`score` is `60 + (k - 3) // 3 * 60`, `steps` is 3, `cycle_start` is 0, `visited` is {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2}, `cycle_length` is 3, `cycle_score` is 60, `cycle_pos` is 1, `remaining_steps` is `k - 3`, `full_cycles` is `(k - 3) // 3`, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0**
