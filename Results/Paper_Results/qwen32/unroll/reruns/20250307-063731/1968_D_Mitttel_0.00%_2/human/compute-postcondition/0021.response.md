Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `start_pos` which is an integer representing the starting position in the permutation. It also implicitly uses the variables `k`, `p`, and `a` which are a non-negative integer representing the number of turns, a list of integers representing the permutation, and a list of integers representing the array `a`, respectively. The function calculates and returns a score based on the formula: 60 + (k - 3) // 3 * 60 + a[0] + a[p[0] - 1].**
