Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array `a`), `k` (a positive integer representing the duration of the game), `PB` (a positive integer representing Bodya's starting position), `PS` (a positive integer representing Sasha's starting position), `p` (a list of `n` integers representing the permutation), and `a` (a list of `n` integers representing the array). It returns the result of the game based on the given rules, where Bodya and Sasha move according to the permutation `p` for `k` steps, and the outcome depends on their final positions and the values in array `a`.**
