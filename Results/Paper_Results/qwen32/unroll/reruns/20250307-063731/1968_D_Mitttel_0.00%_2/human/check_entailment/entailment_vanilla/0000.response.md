Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the described problem.

### Function Analysis

1. **func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):**
   - This function is supposed to compare the scores of Bodya and Sasha after `k` turns and determine the winner.
   - It calls `calculate_score(start_pos)` twice, once for Bodya's starting position (`PB`) and once for Sasha's starting position (`PS`).
   - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.
   - The function is logically correct in terms of comparing scores and determining the winner.

2. **calculate_score(start_pos):**
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting at `start_pos` over `k` turns.
   - It handles both the initial part of the path before any cycle detection and the part inside the cycle.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles in the permutation path.
   - Once a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the full cycles and the remaining steps.
   - The logic for cycle detection and score calculation seems correct.

3. **func_2():**
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the result for each.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the necessary parameters and calling `func_1` to determine the winner.
   - It collects the results and prints them after processing all test cases.
   - The input parsing and result collection logic appear correct.

### Correctness

The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles both the initial path and any cycles in the permutation, calculates the scores for both players, and determines the winner or if the game is a draw.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
