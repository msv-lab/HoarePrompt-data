The code assigns the value of `k - steps` to the variable `remaining_steps`. Since the value of `steps` is given as 3, and the value of `k` is not provided, `remaining_steps` will be `k - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **score is 60, steps is 3, cycle_start is 0, visited is {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2}, cycle_length is 3, cycle_score is 60, cycle_pos is 1, remaining_steps is k - 3.**
