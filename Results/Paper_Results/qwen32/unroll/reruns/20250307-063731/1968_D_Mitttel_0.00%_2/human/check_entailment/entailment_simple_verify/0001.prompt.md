You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the described problem.

### Function Analysis

1. **func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):**
   - This function is supposed to compare the scores of Bodya and Sasha after `k` turns and determine the winner.
   - It calls `calculate_score(start_pos)` twice, once for Bodya's starting position (`PB`) and once for Sasha's starting position (`PS`).
   - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.
   - The function is logically correct in terms of comparing scores and determining the winner.

2. **calculate_score(start_pos):**
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting at `start_pos` over `k` turns.
   - It handles both the initial part of the path before any cycle detection and the part inside the cycle.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles in the permutation path.
   - Once a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the full cycles and the remaining steps.
   - The logic for cycle detection and score calculation seems correct.

3. **func_2():**
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the result for each.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the necessary parameters and calling `func_1` to determine the winner.
   - It collects the results and prints them after processing all test cases.
   - The input parsing and result collection logic appear correct.

### Correctness

The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles both the initial path and any cycles in the permutation, calculates the scores for both players, and determines the winner or if the game is a draw.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
