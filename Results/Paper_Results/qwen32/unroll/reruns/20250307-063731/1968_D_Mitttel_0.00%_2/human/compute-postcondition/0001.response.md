The code snippet `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the standard input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. This means that `data` will now hold a list of strings, each representing a part of the input line.

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` retain their original values. The new variable `data` is introduced and will contain the split input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array a, `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions respectively, such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n. `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of n integers representing the array a, where each element in p and a is a positive integer and 1 <= p_i <= n and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all valid indices i. `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.**
