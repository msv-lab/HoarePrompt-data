Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Global Variable `k`**: The variable `k` is used within the `calculate_score` function, but it is not passed as a parameter to the function. This means that the function relies on a global `k` variable, which is not defined in the provided code. The value of `k` should be passed as a parameter to `calculate_score`.

2. **Global Arrays `a` and `p`**: Similarly, the arrays `a` and `p` are used within the `calculate_score` function, but they are not passed as parameters. This means that the function relies on global arrays, which is not correct. The arrays `a` and `p` should be passed as parameters to `calculate_score`.

3. **Indexing Off-by-One Error**: The current implementation of `calculate_score` uses `current_pos - 1` to index into the arrays `a` and `p`. This is correct if the positions in `p` are 1-based, but the function should be explicitly designed to handle this conversion if necessary.

4. **Handling Large `k` Values**: The program correctly handles large `k` values by detecting cycles in the permutation and calculating the score based on full cycles and the remaining steps. However, the issues mentioned above need to be fixed for the program to work correctly.

To fix these issues, the `calculate_score` function should be modified to accept `k`, `a`, and `p` as parameters. Here is the corrected version of `func_1` and `calculate_score`:

```python
def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):
    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB, k, p, a)
    sasha_score = calculate_score(PS, k, p, a)
    if bodya_score > sasha_score:
        return 'Bodya'
    elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Draw'

def calculate_score(start_pos, k, p, a):
    score = 0
    current_pos = start_pos
    steps = 0
    visited = {}
    cycle_start = -1
    while steps < k:
        if current_pos in visited:
            cycle_start = visited[current_pos]
            break
        visited[current_pos] = steps
        score += a[current_pos - 1]
        steps += 1
        if steps >= k:
            return score
        current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    if cycle_start != -1:
        cycle_length = steps - cycle_start
        cycle_score = 0
        cycle_pos = current_pos
        for _ in range(cycle_length):
            cycle_score += a[cycle_pos - 1]
            cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos - 1]
        remaining_steps = k - steps
        full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
        remainder_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length
        score += full_cycles * cycle_score
        for _ in range(remainder_steps):
            score += a[current_pos - 1]
            current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    return score
```

With these changes, the program should work correctly.
