Postcondition: **`score` is `60 + (k - 3) // 3 * 60 + a[0] + a[p[0] - 1]`, `steps` is 3, `cycle_start` is 0, `visited` is {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2}, `cycle_length` is 3, `cycle_score` is 60, `cycle_pos` is `p[p[0] - 1]`, `remaining_steps` is `k - 3`, `full_cycles` is `(k - 3) // 3`, `remainder_steps` is `(k - 3) % 3`. The else part does not modify any variables.**
