### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for comparing the scores of Bodya and Sasha and determining the winner.
   - It calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha using their starting positions and compares the scores.
   - The function correctly handles the output based on the comparison of the scores.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player given their starting position, the number of turns `k`, the permutation list `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It handles the scenario where the player might enter a cycle in the permutation.
   - It correctly computes the score by summing the values from the array `a` according to the permutation `p` and handles cycles efficiently by calculating the score of a cycle and repeating it as necessary.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from the standard input.
   - It parses the input data for each test case and calls `func_1` to determine the result.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

### Evaluation:
- The functions together handle the parsing of input, the calculation of scores, and the determination of the winner as per the rules of the game.
- The logic for handling cycles in `calculate_score` ensures that the function can handle large values of `k` efficiently.
- The program correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the correct result for each one.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions together correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
