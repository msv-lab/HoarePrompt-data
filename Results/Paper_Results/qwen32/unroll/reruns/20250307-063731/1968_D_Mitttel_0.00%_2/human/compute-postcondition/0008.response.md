To determine the necessary state adjustments for the given `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which is `result` in this case. The loop iterates over the `results` list. 

Given the output state:
```
for result in results:
    # the loop body is omit
```

We need to ensure that the `results` list is properly initialized so that the loop can execute. The loop will execute once for each element in the `results` list. 

Here are the steps to determine the necessary adjustments:

1. **Determine the number of iterations**: The loop will execute `t` times, meaning the `results` list must contain `t` elements.
2. **Ensure the loop can execute**: The `results` list must be initialized with `t` elements before the loop starts.

Since the problem doesn't provide any specific values or constraints on the elements of the `results` list, we can assume that the `results` list is simply a list of `t` elements, where `t` is the number of iterations.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the `results` list contains `t` elements.

State: **`results` is a list containing `t` elements**
