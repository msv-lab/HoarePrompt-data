The code calculates the remainder of `remaining_steps` when divided by `cycle_length` and assigns it to `remainder_steps`. Given the initial state, `remaining_steps` is `k - 3` and `cycle_length` is 3. Therefore, `remainder_steps` will be `(k - 3) % 3`.

Output State: **`score` is 60, `steps` is 3, `cycle_start` is 0, `visited` is {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2}, `cycle_length` is 3, `cycle_score` is 60, `cycle_pos` is 1, `remaining_steps` is `k - 3`, `full_cycles` is `(k - 3) // 3`, `remainder_steps` is `(k - 3) % 3`**.
