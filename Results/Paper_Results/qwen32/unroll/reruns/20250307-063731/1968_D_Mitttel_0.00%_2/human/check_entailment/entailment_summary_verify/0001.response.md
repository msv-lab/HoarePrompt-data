Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the provided code and function summaries.

### Function Analysis

1. **func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):**
   - This function compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha after `k` turns and determines the winner.
   - It calls `calculate_score(start_pos)` for Bodya's starting position (`PB`) and Sasha's starting position (`PS`).
   - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.
   - The function's logic is correct in terms of comparing scores and determining the winner.

2. **calculate_score(start_pos):**
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting at `start_pos` over `k` turns.
   - It handles both the initial part of the path before any cycle detection and the part inside the cycle.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles in the permutation path.
   - Once a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the full cycles and the remaining steps.
   - The logic for cycle detection and score calculation seems correct, but let's verify this with a closer look at the implementation.

3. **func_2():**
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the result for each.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the necessary parameters and calling `func_1` to determine the winner.
   - It collects the results and prints them after processing all test cases.
   - The input parsing and result collection logic appear correct.

### Detailed Examination of `calculate_score(start_pos)`

Let's take a closer look at the `calculate_score` function to ensure it handles all edge cases correctly:

- **Cycle Detection:**
  - The function uses a dictionary `visited` to store the step at which each position was first visited.
  - If a position is revisited (i.e., it's already in `visited`), it identifies the start of the cycle.
  - The cycle length is calculated as the difference between the current step and the step at which the position was first visited (`cycle_length = steps - cycle_start`).

- **Cycle Score Calculation:**
  - Once a cycle is detected, the function calculates the score for one full cycle.
  - It then calculates the number of full cycles that fit into the remaining steps (`full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length`) and adds the score for these full cycles to the total score.
  - It also calculates the score for the remaining steps that do not form a full cycle (`remainder_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length`).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If the player does not enter a cycle within `k` steps, the function correctly calculates the score based on the path taken.
  - If the player enters a cycle, the function correctly calculates the score for the full cycles and the remaining steps.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the function with the first example provided:

- **Input:**
  ```
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  Bodya
  ```

- **Execution:**
  - **Bodya's Score Calculation:**
    - Start at position 3.
    - Turn 1: Score = 5, Stay at position 3.
    - Turn 2: Score = 10, Stay at position 3.
    - Final score = 10.

  - **Sasha's Score Calculation:**
    - Start at position 2.
    - Turn 1: Score = 2, Move to position 1.
    - Turn 2: Score = 9, Stay at position 1.
    - Final score = 9.

- **Result:**
  - Bodya wins with a score of 10.

The function correctly calculates the scores and determines the winner.

### Conclusion

After a detailed analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles both the initial path and any cycles in the permutation, calculates the scores for both players, and determines the winner or if the game is a draw.

Final: **True**
