### Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for determining the winner of the game by comparing the scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It calls the `calculate_score` function twice, once for Bodya's starting position and once for Sasha's starting position.
   - Based on the scores, it returns 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw'.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position.
   - It iterates through the permutation, adding the corresponding values from the array `a` to the score.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the player revisits a position), it calculates the score for the cycle and uses it to compute the total score efficiently, especially when `k` is large.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the result.
   - It reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` to determine the result of each test case and stores the result in a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The `calculate_score` function correctly handles the scenario where a cycle is detected, ensuring efficient computation even for large values of `k`.
   - The `func_1` function correctly compares the scores and returns the appropriate result.
   - The `func_2` function correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.
   - The provided example and the annotated states match the expected behavior of the program.
