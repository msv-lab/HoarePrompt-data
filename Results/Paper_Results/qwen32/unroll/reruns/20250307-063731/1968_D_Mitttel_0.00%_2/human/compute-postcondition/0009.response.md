To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to focus on the given loop and its context. The loop provided is:

```python
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

Given the initial state description:
- `index` will point to a position in the `data` list that is `4 + 2*n` positions after its initial position for each iteration.
- The `results` list will contain `t` results, one from each iteration.

The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list and prints it. Since there are `t` results in the `results` list, the loop will execute `t` times, printing each result in sequence.

The output state of the loop is simply the printed results. Since the loop does not modify any variables outside of its scope (like `index` or `data`), the only change is the output to the console.

Therefore, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **The console will display each element of the `results` list, one per line, in the order they appear in the list.**
