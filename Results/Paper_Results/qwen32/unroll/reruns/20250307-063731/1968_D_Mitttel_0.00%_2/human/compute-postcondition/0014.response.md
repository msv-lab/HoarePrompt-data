Output State: **score is 60, steps is 3, cycle_start is 0, visited is {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2}, cycle_length is 3, cycle_score is 60, cycle_pos is 1, remaining_steps is k - 3, full_cycles is (k - 3) // 3**

In this output state, the value of `full_cycles` is calculated as `(k - 3) // 3`. All other variables retain their initial values.
