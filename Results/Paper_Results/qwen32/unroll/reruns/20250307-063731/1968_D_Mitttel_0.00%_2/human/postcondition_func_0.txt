The function determines the winner of a game between Bodya and Sasha based on their scores, which are calculated from their starting positions. It returns 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, and 'Draw' if both scores are equal. The function takes into account the length of the permutation and array `n`, the duration of the game `k`, the starting positions `PB` and `PS`, the permutation list `p`, and the array `a`.
