### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the described "Permutation game" problem by calculating the scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions, the permutation, and the array of scores. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the length of the permutation `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (`PB` and `PS`), the permutation `p`, and the score array `a`.
   - It calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha by calling `calculate_score` for their respective starting positions.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the winner ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position.
   - It tracks the current position, the number of steps taken, and the score accumulated.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles in the permutation.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by considering full cycles and the remainder steps.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` to determine the winner for each case.
   - It collects the results and prints them.

### Analysis:

- **Cycle Detection**: The program correctly detects cycles in the permutation, which is crucial for handling large values of `k` efficiently.
- **Score Calculation**: The score calculation is done correctly, taking into account both the initial steps and the cycles.
- **Input Handling**: The input reading and parsing are correctly implemented to handle multiple test cases.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles the input correctly, calculates the scores accurately, and outputs the correct winner for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
