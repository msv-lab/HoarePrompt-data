Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array a, `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions respectively, such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n. `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of n integers representing the array a, where each element in p and a is a positive integer and 1 <= p_i <= n and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all valid indices i. `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line. `index` is 1. `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`. `results` is an empty list.**

The variable `results` has been initialized as an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values as described.
