The provided code snippet is a function definition, but it does not contain any executable code that affects the initial state. The function is intended to find the value of `y` that maximizes the expression `gcd(x, y) + y`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor function. However, since there is no actual code execution, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.**
