Output State: **The program returns `ans + 1`. Given that `ans` contains the count of elements that were completely removed, and since `nums` has a length of 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`, the single element in `nums` will be removed, incrementing `ans` by 1. Therefore, the program returns the initial value of `ans` plus 1.**
