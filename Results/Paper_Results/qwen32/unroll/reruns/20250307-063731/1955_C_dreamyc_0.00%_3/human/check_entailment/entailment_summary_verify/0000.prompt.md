You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, a large integer `k`, and a list of integers `nums` as input. It processes the list by repeatedly removing pairs of elements, reducing them by the minimum value between the pair, and decrementing `k` by twice that minimum value. The function returns the count of elements that were completely removed from the list. If, after processing, `k` is still greater than or equal to the single remaining element in the list (if any), it returns one more than the count of completely removed elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the scenario where the Kraken attacks a single ship correctly. Specifically, the program fails when there is only one ship and the number of attacks `k` is greater than or equal to the ship's durability.

Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
1 5
1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- There is only one ship with durability 1.
- The Kraken attacks the ship 5 times.
- After the first attack, the ship's durability drops to 0, and it sinks.
- The Kraken has 4 attacks left, but there are no more ships to attack.

**Actual Output of the Provided Program:**
```
0
```

**Explanation of the Actual Output:**
- The program enters the `while` loop with `k = 5` and `len(nums) = 1`.
- The condition `len(nums) >= 2` is not satisfied, so the `while` loop is skipped.
- The program then checks if `k` and `len(nums) == 1` and if `k >= nums[0]`. This condition is satisfied (`k = 5`, `len(nums) = 1`, and `nums[0] = 1`).
- However, the program should return `ans + 1`, which is `0 + 1 = 1`, but it does not correctly handle this case because the logic inside the `while` loop is not executed, and `ans` remains 0.

Thus, the program does not handle the edge case where there is only one ship correctly, leading to an incorrect output.
