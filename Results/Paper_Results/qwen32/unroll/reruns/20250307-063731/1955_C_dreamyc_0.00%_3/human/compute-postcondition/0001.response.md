The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ans` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of integers of length n where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and `ans` is 0.**
