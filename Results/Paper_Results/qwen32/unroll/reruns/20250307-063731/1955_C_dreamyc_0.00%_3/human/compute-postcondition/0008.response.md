Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of the list `nums`), `k` (an integer), and `nums` (a list of integers of length `n`). The function returns `ans + 1` if `n` is 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`, indicating that the single element is completely removed. Otherwise, it returns `ans`, which represents the count of elements that were completely removed from the list `nums`.**
