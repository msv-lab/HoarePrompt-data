You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and nums is a list of integers of length n where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `nums` contains the remaining elements after the loop, and `ans` contains the count of elements that were completely removed.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns `ans + 1`. Given that `ans` contains the count of elements that were completely removed, and since `nums` has a length of 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`, the single element in `nums` will be removed, incrementing `ans` by 1. Therefore, the program returns the initial value of `ans` plus 1.
    #State: `nums` contains the remaining elements after the loop, and `ans` contains the count of elements that were completely removed. Either `k` is false, or the length of `nums` is not 1, or `k` is less than `nums[0]`.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which contains the count of elements that were completely removed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of the list `nums`), `k` (an integer), and `nums` (a list of integers of length `n`). The function returns `ans + 1` if `n` is 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`, indicating that the single element is completely removed. Otherwise, it returns `ans`, which represents the count of elements that were completely removed from the list `nums`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns `ans + 1`. Given that `ans` contains the count of elements that were completely removed, and since `nums` has a length of 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`, the single element in `nums` will be removed, incrementing `ans` by 1. Therefore, the program returns the initial value of `ans` plus 1.

Case_2: The program returns `ans`, which contains the count of elements that were completely removed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
