Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, a large integer `k`, and a list of integers `nums` as input. It processes the list by repeatedly removing pairs of elements, reducing them by the minimum value between the pair, and decrementing `k` by twice that minimum value. The function returns the count of elements that were completely removed from the list. If, after processing, `k` is still greater than or equal to the single remaining element in the list (if any), it returns one more than the count of completely removed elements. **
