#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and nums is a list of integers of length n where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)

    #State: `nums` contains the remaining elements after the loop, and `ans` contains the count of elements that were completely removed.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns `ans + 1`. Given that `ans` contains the count of elements that were completely removed, and since `nums` has a length of 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`, the single element in `nums` will be removed, incrementing `ans` by 1. Therefore, the program returns the initial value of `ans` plus 1.
    #State: `nums` contains the remaining elements after the loop, and `ans` contains the count of elements that were completely removed. Either `k` is false, or the length of `nums` is not 1, or `k` is less than `nums[0]`.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which contains the count of elements that were completely removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, a large integer `k`, and a list of integers `nums` as input. It processes the list by repeatedly removing pairs of elements, reducing them by the minimum value between the pair, and decrementing `k` by twice that minimum value. The function returns the count of elements that were completely removed from the list. If, after processing, `k` is still greater than or equal to the single remaining element in the list (if any), it returns one more than the count of completely removed elements.
