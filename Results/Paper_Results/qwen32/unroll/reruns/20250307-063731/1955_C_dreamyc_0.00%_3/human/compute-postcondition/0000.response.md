The code converts the list `nums` into a `deque`. The values of `n`, `k`, and the elements of `nums` remain unchanged except for the type of `nums` which is now a `deque` instead of a list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `nums` is a deque of integers of length n where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
