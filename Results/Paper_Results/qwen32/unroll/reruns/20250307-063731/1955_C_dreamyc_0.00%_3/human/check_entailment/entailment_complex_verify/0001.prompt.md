You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: `nums` contains the remaining elements after the loop, and `ans` contains the count of elements that were completely removed.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns `ans + 1`. Given that `ans` contains the count of elements that were completely removed, and since `nums` has a length of 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`, the single element in `nums` will be removed, incrementing `ans` by 1. Therefore, the program returns the initial value of `ans` plus 1.
    #State: `nums` contains the remaining elements after the loop, and `ans` contains the count of elements that were completely removed. Either `k` is false, or the length of `nums` is not 1, or `k` is less than `nums[0]`.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which contains the count of elements that were completely removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, a large integer `k`, and a list of integers `nums` as input. It processes the list by repeatedly removing pairs of elements, reducing them by the minimum value between the pair, and decrementing `k` by twice that minimum value. The function returns the count of elements that were completely removed from the list. If, after processing, `k` is still greater than or equal to the single remaining element in the list (if any), it returns one more than the count of completely removed elements.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem, let's analyze its logic step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves a series of attacks on a list of ships, where the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship in the list. Each attack reduces the durability of the attacked ship by 1. If a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is removed from the list. The process continues until either all ships have sunk or the Kraken has made `k` attacks.

### Program Analysis
The provided program uses a deque to efficiently remove elements from both the start and end of the list. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It also reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The list `nums` is converted to a deque to allow efficient popping from both ends.
   - The variable `ans` keeps track of the number of ships that have sunk.
   - The program enters a loop that continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and there are at least two ships (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - Inside the loop:
     - The first and last ships are popped from the deque.
     - The minimum durability between the two ships (`x`) is determined.
     - If there are enough attacks left to sink both ships (`k >= 2 * x`), the durability of both ships is reduced by `x`, and `k` is decreased by `2 * x`.
     - If either ship is not completely sunk (`a > 0` or `b > 0`), it is appended back to the deque.
     - If a ship is sunk (`a == 0` or `b == 0`), `ans` is incremented.
     - If there are not enough attacks left to sink both ships, the loop breaks.
   - After the loop, if there is one ship left and enough attacks remain to sink it (`k >= nums[0]`), `ans` is incremented by 1.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the number of sunk ships (`ans`) is printed.

### Correctness Verification
Let's verify if the program correctly handles the given examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `4 5 1 2 4 3`
   - Process:
     1. Attack first ship: `[2, 4, 3]`
     2. Attack last ship: `[2, 4, 2]`
     3. Attack first ship: `[1, 4, 2]`
     4. Attack last ship: `[1, 4, 1]`
     5. Attack first ship: `[4, 1]`
   - Output: `2` (ships 1 and 3 are sunk)
   - The program correctly outputs `2`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `4 6 1 2 4 3`
   - Process:
     1. Attack first ship: `[2, 4, 3]`
     2. Attack last ship: `[2, 4, 2]`
     3. Attack first ship: `[1, 4, 2]`
     4. Attack last ship: `[1, 4, 1]`
     5. Attack first ship: `[4, 1]`
     6. Attack last ship: `[4]`
   - Output: `3` (ships 1, 3, and 4 are sunk)
   - The program correctly outputs `3`.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `5 20 2 7 1 8 2`
   - Process:
     1. Attack first ship: `[7, 1, 8, 2]`
     2. Attack last ship: `[7, 1, 8]`
     3. Attack first ship: `[1, 8]`
     4. Attack last ship: `[1]`
     5. Attack first ship: `[]`
   - Output: `5` (all ships are sunk)
   - The program correctly outputs `5`.

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `2 2 3 2`
   - Process:
     1. Attack first ship: `[2, 2]`
     2. Attack last ship: `[]`
   - Output: `0` (no ships are sunk)
   - The program correctly outputs `0`.

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `2 15 1 5`
   - Process:
     1. Attack first ship: `[5]`
     2. Attack last ship: `[]`
   - Output: `2` (both ships are sunk)
   - The program correctly outputs `2`.

6. **Example 6**:
   - Input: `2 7 5 2`
   - Process:
     1. Attack first ship: `[4, 2]`
     2. Attack last ship: `[4]`
     3. Attack first ship: `[]`
   - Output: `2` (both ships are sunk)
   - The program correctly outputs `2`.

The program correctly handles all the provided examples and follows the problem's logic accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
