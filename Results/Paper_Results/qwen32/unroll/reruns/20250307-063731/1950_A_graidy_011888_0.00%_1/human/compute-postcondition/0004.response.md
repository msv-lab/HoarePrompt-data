Functionality: **The function prints 1000 lines, each consisting of three random integers between 1 and 9, followed by one of the strings 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'. The strings 'peak' and 'stair' are determined based on the relative values of the three integers, while 'none' indicates no specific increasing or decreasing order. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
