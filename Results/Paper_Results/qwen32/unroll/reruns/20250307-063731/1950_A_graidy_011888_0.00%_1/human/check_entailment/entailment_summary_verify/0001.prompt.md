You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function prints 1000 lines, each consisting of three random integers between 1 and 9, followed by one of the strings 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'. The strings 'peak' and 'stair' are determined based on the relative values of the three integers, while 'none' indicates no specific increasing or decreasing order. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task is to read a number of test cases, each consisting of three digits, and determine if they form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE". However, the given program generates random numbers and checks their configuration, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement to read input values.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. The program does not read any input from the user. It generates random numbers instead of using provided test cases.
2. The program does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. It only generates and checks one set of numbers in each iteration of the loop.
3. The program outputs the generated numbers and their configuration, but it does not match the expected output format for the problem.
4. The program uses lowercase strings ('peak', 'stair', 'none') for the results, while the problem requires uppercase strings ('PEAK', 'STAIR', 'NONE').

Since the program does not follow the problem's requirements, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
