The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than or equal to 1000.

Right before the loop, `i` is 1. Since 1 is less than or equal to 1000, the loop can execute without any adjustments to `i`.

Therefore, no other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `i` is 1**
