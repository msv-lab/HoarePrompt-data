Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, each ranging from 0 to 9. For each test case, the function determines if the sequence `a`, `b`, `c` is strictly increasing, strictly decreasing, or neither, and returns the corresponding result for each test case.**
