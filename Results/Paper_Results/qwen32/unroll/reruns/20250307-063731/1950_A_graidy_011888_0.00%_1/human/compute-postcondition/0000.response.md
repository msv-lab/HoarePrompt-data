The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `i` to 1. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are part of the initial state and are not modified by the given code.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; i is 1.**
