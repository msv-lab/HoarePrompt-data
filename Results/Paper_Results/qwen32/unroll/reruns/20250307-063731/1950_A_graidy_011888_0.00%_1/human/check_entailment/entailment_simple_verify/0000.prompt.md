You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Annotated Code: 
from random import randint

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: The loop will have printed 1000 lines, each consisting of three random integers between 1 and 9, followed by one of the strings 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'. The variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `res` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `i` will be 1001. The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Instead of reading input values and determining whether the digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE", the program generates random numbers and checks conditions on them. This does not align with the problem's requirements.

The program should read test cases from input, process each set of three digits, and output the correct classification ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE"). The current implementation does not read any input, instead, it generates random numbers and prints the results of the checks on these random numbers.

Here is a corrected version of the program based on the problem description:

```python
def determine_pattern(a, b, c):
    if a < b < c:
        return "STAIR"
    elif a > b > c:
        return "PEAK"
    else:
        return "NONE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    t = int(input[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(input[index])
        b = int(input[index + 1])
        c = int(input[index + 2])
        result = determine_pattern(a, b, c)
        results.append(result)
        index += 3
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# main()
```

This corrected program reads the number of test cases, processes each set of three digits, and outputs the correct classification for each test case.
