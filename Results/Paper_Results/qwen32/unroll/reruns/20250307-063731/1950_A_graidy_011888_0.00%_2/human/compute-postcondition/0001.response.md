In this task, we need to ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once. The loop condition is `i <= 1000`. Given that `i` is initially set to 1, the loop condition is already satisfied because 1 is indeed less than or equal to 1000.

Thus, no adjustments are needed to the state of `i` or any other variables in the loop head to ensure that the loop can execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `i` is 1**
