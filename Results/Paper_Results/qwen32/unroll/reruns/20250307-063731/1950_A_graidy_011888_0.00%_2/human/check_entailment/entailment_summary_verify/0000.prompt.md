You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function generates and prints 1000 sets of three random integers between 1 and 9, followed by a string ('peak', 'stair', or 'none') based on specific conditions comparing the integers. The input parameters `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not used within the function. The final state consists of 1000 lines of output, each containing three integers and a string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description. The problem requires reading input test cases and determining whether the digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case. However, the given program generates random test cases and checks a specific condition without reading any input from the user. It also outputs the results in a way that does not match the required format. 

For example, the program does not handle the input format as described in the problem statement, where the first line contains the number of test cases and each subsequent line contains three digits. Instead, it generates random digits and checks if they form a "peak" or "stair" without adhering to the input format or producing the correct output format.

The correct approach would be to read the input as specified, process each test case, and print the appropriate result for each one. Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def determine_shape(a, b, c):
    if a < b < c:
        return "STAIR"
    elif a > b > c:
        return "PEAK"
    else:
        return "NONE"

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()
    t = int(input[0])
    results = []
    for i in range(1, t + 1):
        a, b, c = map(int, input[i].split())
        result = determine_shape(a, b, c)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation reads the input correctly, processes each test case, and prints the correct output for each one.
