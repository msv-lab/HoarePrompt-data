Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n`, a list `a` of `n` distinct integers in increasing order, and an integer `m`. For each of the `m` queries, it accepts two distinct integers `x_i` and `y_i` (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n). The function returns the absolute difference between the `x_i`-th and `y_i`-th elements of the list `a` for each query.**
