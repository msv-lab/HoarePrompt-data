Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `r` is a lambda function that maps the input to a tuple of integers.**

The variable `r` is now a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and converts each component to an integer. Other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, `y_i`) remain unchanged.
