t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple containing three elements: an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, a list a of n integers where 0 <= a[0] < a[1] < ... < a[n-1] <= 10^9, and an integer m such that 1 <= m <= 10^5. Additionally, each of the m queries is a tuple of two integers (x, y) where 1 <= x, y <= n and x != y. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city in a, the closest city is uniquely determined.
