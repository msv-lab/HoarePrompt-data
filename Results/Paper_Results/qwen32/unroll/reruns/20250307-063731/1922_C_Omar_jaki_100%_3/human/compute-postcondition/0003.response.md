To determine the output state after the loop finishes executing, let's analyze the given code step-by-step.

The loop is structured as follows:

```python
while t:
    t -= 1
    r()
    a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
    b = [0, 0]
    for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
        v = y - x
        b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
    u, = r()
    while u:
        u -= 1
        c, d = r()
        if c < d:
            print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
        else:
            print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization and Input Processing:**
   - The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `r()` is called (though its exact behavior isn't specified, we assume it reads input).
   - The list `a` is constructed with `-1000000000.0` at the beginning, followed by the result of `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`.

2. **List `b` Construction:**
   - `b` is initialized as `[0, 0]`.
   - For each tuple `(w, x, y, z)` in `zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:])`, the following operations are performed:
     - `v = y - x`
     - Two new elements are added to `b`:
       - `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`
       - `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`
     - The expression `v ** (v > x - w)` is equivalent to `v if v > x - w else 0`.
     - Similarly, `v ** (v > z - y)` is equivalent to `v if v > z - y else 0`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - Another value `u` is read, indicating the number of queries.
   - For each query, two values `c` and `d` are read.
   - Depending on whether `c < d` or `c > d`, a specific difference from `b` is printed:
     - If `c < d`, it prints `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]`.
     - If `c > d`, it prints `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]`.

### Output State:

The output state is determined by the printed values for each query. Since the exact input values and the behavior of `r()` are not specified, we can only describe the output state in terms of the values that would be printed based on the logic described.

**Output State:** **The output state consists of a series of printed values, each representing the result of a query. The specific values depend on the input data provided to the function `r()` and the queries `c` and `d`.**

In natural language, the output state is a sequence of printed integers, each corresponding to the result of a query processed within the nested while loop. The exact values printed depend on the input data for each test case and query.
