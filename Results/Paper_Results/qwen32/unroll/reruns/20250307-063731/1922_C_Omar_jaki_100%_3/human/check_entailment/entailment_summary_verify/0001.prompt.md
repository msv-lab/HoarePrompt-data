You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Program:
def func():
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        r()
        a = (-1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0)
        b = [0, 0]
        for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += (b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y))
        (u,) = r()
        while u:
            u -= 1
            (c, d) = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives a list of distinct integers in increasing order and a series of queries. Each query consists of two indices, and the function outputs the absolute difference between the elements at these indices in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, their coordinates `a`, the number of queries `m`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Closest City Definition:**
   - The problem defines the closest city uniquely for each city based on the distances.
   - The program does not explicitly calculate the closest city but instead calculates something related to the distances between cities.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The program constructs a list `a` with padding values `-1000000000.0` and `2000000000.0` at the beginning and end, respectively.
   - It then constructs a list `b` which seems to accumulate distances in a specific way using a loop and the `zip` function.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(c, d)`, the program prints the difference in accumulated distances from `b` based on whether `c < d` or `c > d`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Distance Accumulation Logic:**
   - The logic inside the loop for constructing `b` is not clear. The expression `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)` does not make sense in the context of distance accumulation. It seems to be trying to use the power operator `**` in a way that doesn't align with typical distance calculations.
   - The program is not correctly accumulating distances in a way that would allow it to answer the queries correctly.

2. **Closest City Utilization:**
   - The program does not utilize the closest city information explicitly, which is crucial for minimizing the number of coins spent as described in the problem statement.
   - The problem requires traveling to the closest city for 1 coin, which is not implemented in the current logic.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The output calculation based on the accumulated distances in `b` is incorrect. The program is not correctly handling the queries to find the minimum number of coins required.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It fails to properly calculate the closest cities and does not use this information to minimize the number of coins spent for each query.
