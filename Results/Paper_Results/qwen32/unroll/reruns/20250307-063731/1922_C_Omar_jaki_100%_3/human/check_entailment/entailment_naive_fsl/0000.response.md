Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine and use the closest city for each query. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**: The program seems to be trying to calculate some cumulative distances, but it is not correctly identifying the closest cities for each city. The logic for calculating `b` is unclear and does not align with the problem's requirement of finding the closest city for each city and using that information to determine the minimum cost.

2. **Handling Queries**: The program attempts to use the precomputed `b` array to determine the cost of traveling between cities. However, this approach does not take into account the closest city rule and instead seems to be using some cumulative distance logic, which is not correct.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, in the given example, the program should correctly identify the closest city for each city and use that information to calculate the minimum cost. However, the provided program does not do this correctly.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

**Program Output:**
The provided program will not produce the expected output because it does not correctly determine the closest city for each city and use that information to calculate the minimum cost.

To fix the program, we need to correctly identify the closest city for each city and then use a dynamic programming or similar approach to calculate the minimum cost of traveling between cities using the closest city rule. The current program does not do this correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is False.
