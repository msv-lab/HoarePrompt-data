Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Rules:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and deleting them.
   - Alice appends her chosen element to array `c`.
   - Bob does not append his chosen element to `c`.
   - The game continues until `a` is empty.
   - The score is the MEX of array `c` at the end of the game.
   - Alice aims to maximize the score, and Bob aims to minimize it.

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the final score of the game when both players play optimally.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution appears to follow a strategy based on the counts of each number in the array `a`.

1. **Count Elements:**
   - `cntl` is an array where `cntl[i]` counts the occurrences of integer `i` in `a`.

2. **Handling Zeros:**
   - If there are no zeros in `a` (`cntl[0] == 0`), the MEX is `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `c`.

3. **Determine Initial Contribution:**
   - `c` is initialized to the minimum of `2` and the count of `0`s in `a`. This step ensures that if there are two or more zeros, Alice can contribute at least two zeros to `c` to maximize the MEX.

4. **Iterate Over Remaining Elements:**
   - The loop iterates over elements from `1` to `n`.
   - For each element `j`, if its count in `a` is less than `2`, `c` is decremented.
   - If `c` becomes `0` or `j` reaches `n`, the current `j` is printed as the MEX.

### Correctness Analysis:
Let's verify if the logic correctly determines the MEX based on optimal play:

1. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to add elements to `c` that are not already in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from adding elements to `c` that would increase the MEX.

2. **Handling Zeros:**
   - If there are no zeros, the MEX is `0`, which is correct.
   - If there are zeros, Alice can add up to two zeros to `c` to ensure the MEX is at least `2` if possible.

3. **Iterating Over Elements:**
   - The loop correctly identifies the smallest element that is not in `c` by checking the counts.
   - By decrementing `c` when an element with a count less than `2` is encountered, the solution ensures that the MEX is correctly identified.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of `c` based on the optimal play of Alice and Bob. The solution handles all edge cases and ensures that the MEX is calculated accurately.

**Correctness: True**
