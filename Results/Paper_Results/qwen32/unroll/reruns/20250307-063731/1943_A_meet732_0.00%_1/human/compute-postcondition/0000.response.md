In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute once for each test case. The variables `n` and `a` are defined within each iteration of the loop and are not part of the loop head. Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

Let's break it down:

1. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The loop will execute `int(input())` times, which means it depends on the value of `t`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1.
3. The state of `t` is already given as `1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4`, which means it already satisfies the condition to execute the loop at least once.

Since `t` is within the valid range that allows the loop to execute, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself. However, to explicitly state the condition for the loop to execute, we can say that `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4**
