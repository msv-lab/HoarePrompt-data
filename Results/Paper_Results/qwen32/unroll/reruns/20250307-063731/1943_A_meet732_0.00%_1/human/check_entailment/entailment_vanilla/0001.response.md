To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice starts with an empty array `c`. They take turns picking elements from `a`, with Alice appending the picked element to `c` and Bob just deleting it. The game ends when `a` is empty. The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` after the game ends, given both players play optimally.

- **Alice's Objective:** Maximize the MEX of `c`.
- **Bob's Objective:** Minimize the MEX of `c`.

The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Optimal Strategies

1. **Alice's Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she should try to include as many distinct integers in `c` as possible.
   - If `0` is present, Alice should include it in `c` to ensure MEX is at least `1`.
   - Alice should aim to include `1`, `2`, ..., up to the highest possible integer that can be added to `c`.

2. **Bob's Strategy:**
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he should try to prevent Alice from including certain integers in `c`.
   - If `0` is present, Bob should prevent Alice from including it in `c` to keep MEX as `0`.
   - Bob should aim to prevent Alice from including `1`, `2`, ..., up to the highest possible integer that can be added to `c`.

### Key Observations

- If `0` is not present in `a`, the MEX is `0` because Alice cannot include `0` in `c`.
- If `0` is present, Alice will include it in `c` to ensure MEX is at least `1`.
- The number of `0`s in `a` affects Alice's strategy. If there are at least two `0`s, Alice can ensure `0` is included in `c` and then aim to include `1`.
- If there is only one `0`, Alice can still include `0` in `c` but will have to be careful about subsequent integers.
- The game revolves around the count of each integer in `a` and how they can be included or excluded based on the players' turns.

### Program Analysis

The program uses a counting array `cntl` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`. It then determines the MEX based on the counts:

1. If `0` is not present (`cntl[0] == 0`), the MEX is `0`.
2. If `0` is present, the program calculates a value `c` which is the minimum of `2` and the count of `0`s.
3. It then iterates through the integers from `1` to `n` and checks their counts:
   - If an integer's count is less than `2`, it decreases `c` by `1`.
   - If `c` becomes `0` or the integer is `n`, it prints the integer as the MEX.

### Correctness of the Program

The program's logic correctly determines the MEX based on the counts of integers in `a` and the rules of the game. Here's why:

- If `0` is not present, the MEX is correctly identified as `0`.
- If `0` is present, the program correctly handles the inclusion of `0` and subsequent integers.
- The use of `c` to track the number of turns and the inclusion of integers ensures that the MEX is calculated correctly based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of `c` after the game ends, given both players play optimally.

Correctness: **True**
