### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the final score of the game as described in the problem statement. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count occurrences of each integer in the array `a`. This is done using a loop that increments the count for each element in `a`.
   - This step ensures that we know how many times each integer appears in the array.

3. **Determine the Game's Score:**
   - If `cntl[0] == 0`, it means that `0` does not appear in the array `a`. According to the rules of the game, the MEX of an array that does not contain `0` is `0`. Therefore, the program directly prints `0` in this case.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the number of moves Alice can make that contribute to the MEX. This is limited by the number of `0`s in the array, but not more than 2 because Alice and Bob take turns, and Alice can only add a number to `c` if it is her turn.
     - `c = min(2, cntl[0])` sets the number of moves Alice can make optimally.
   - The program then iterates over the range `[1, n]` to find the smallest integer `j` such that the number of elements in `a` that are less than `2` is exhausted. If `cntl[j] < 2`, it means that the number of moves Alice can make is reduced by 1 (`c -= 1`). If `c` becomes `0` or if `j` reaches `n`, the program prints `j` as the MEX and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Optimal Play:**
   - Alice's goal is to maximize the MEX, and Bob's goal is to minimize it.
   - By ensuring that Alice adds `0` to `c` if possible and then focusing on the smallest missing number, the program correctly simulates the optimal play scenario.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the logic required to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. It handles all edge cases, such as when `0` is not present in the array or when the array contains multiple instances of `0`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
