To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the code step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The game revolves around two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to a new array `c`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c` while Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Key Observations:
1. **Turn Order**: Alice goes first, then Bob, and so on, until the array `a` is empty.
2. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of the final array `c` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `c`.

### Strategy:
- **Alice's Optimal Play**: Alice will try to add elements to `c` such that the MEX is maximized. She will attempt to ensure that the smallest missing number is as large as possible.
- **Bob's Optimal Play**: Bob will try to prevent Alice from maximizing the MEX by removing numbers that Alice would otherwise use to increase the MEX.

### Correctness of the Provided Code:
Let's break down the code and see if it aligns with the optimal strategies for both players.

1. **Counting Elements**:
   ```python
   cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
   for i in a:
       cntl[i] += 1
   ```
   This part correctly counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a`.

2. **Handling the Case When 0 is Not Present**:
   ```python
   if cntl[0] == 0:
       print(0)
   ```
   If `0` is not present in the array, the MEX is `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array, and Alice cannot add it to `c`.

3. **Determining the MEX**:
   ```python
   c = min(2, cntl[0])
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       if cntl[j] < 2:
           c -= 1
           if not c or j == n:
               print(j)
               break
   ```
   - The variable `c` is initialized to the minimum of `2` and the count of `0` in the array. This is because Alice can add at most two `0`s to `c` to delay the MEX from being `0`.
   - The loop iterates through numbers starting from `1` to `n`. For each number `j`, if its count is less than `2`, it means that Bob can prevent Alice from adding more than one `j` to `c`. The variable `c` is decremented in this case.
   - If `c` becomes `0` or the loop reaches the end, the current number `j` is printed as the MEX.

### Potential Issues:
- The logic for determining the MEX seems to be based on the count of each number and the turns taken by Alice and Bob. However, the provided code does not fully account for the optimal strategies of both players.
- Specifically, the code does not consider the alternating turns and the strategic removal of elements by Bob to minimize the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for both players. It simplifies the problem by only considering the count of each number and the turns, but it does not accurately simulate the game dynamics.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
