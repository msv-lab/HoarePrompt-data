### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the MEX of the array `c` at the end of a game where Alice and Bob alternately pick elements from array `a` and Alice aims to maximize the MEX while Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c`.

The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. It counts the occurrences of each number in `a` using a list `cntl` of size `n+1`.
4. If there's no `0` in `a` (`cntl[0] == 0`), the MEX is `0` because Alice will not be able to add `0` to `c`.
5. Otherwise, it initializes `c` to the minimum of `2` and the count of `0`s in `a` (`cntl[0]`).
6. It then iterates over the numbers from `1` to `n`, decrementing `c` each time it encounters a number with fewer than `2` occurrences in `a`.
7. When `c` reaches `0` or the loop completes, it prints the current number `j` as the MEX.

The key insight is that Alice can always force the MEX to be the smallest number that appears fewer than twice in `a`, because she can always pick the smaller numbers first, ensuring that Bob cannot prevent her from adding the necessary numbers to `c`.

The program correctly identifies the MEX by following this logic. It handles the edge cases where there are no `0`s in `a` or where all numbers appear at least twice. It also efficiently counts the occurrences of each number and determines the MEX based on these counts.

### Correctness: **True**
