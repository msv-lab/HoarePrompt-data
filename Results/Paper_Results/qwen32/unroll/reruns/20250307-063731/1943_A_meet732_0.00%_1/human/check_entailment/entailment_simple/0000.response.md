### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been moved from `a` to `c` according to the rules of the game. Let's break down the program and see if it correctly implements the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob.

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - It initializes a list `cntl` of size `n+1` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates over `a` to populate `cntl`.

3. **Determining the MEX:**
   - If `cntl[0]` (the count of zeros in `a`) is `0`, the MEX is `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `a`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `c` to be the minimum of `2` and `cntl[0]`. This variable `c` is used to track the number of elements that can be chosen by Alice to ensure that the MEX is maximized.
   - The program then iterates from `1` to `n` to find the smallest `j` such that the count of elements less than `2` (tracked by `c`) is exhausted. If `c` becomes `0` or `j` reaches `n`, it prints `j` as the MEX.

### Analysis:

- **Alice's Strategy:** Alice wants to maximize the MEX. She can do this by ensuring that the smallest numbers are included in `c` up to a certain point, but not too many of the same number to allow Bob to minimize the MEX.
- **Bob's Strategy:** Bob wants to minimize the MEX. He can do this by removing elements that would otherwise help Alice maximize the MEX.

The logic in the program correctly reflects these strategies:
- If there are no zeros, the MEX is `0`.
- If there are zeros, Alice can place up to two zeros in `c` because Bob can only remove one of them in his turn.
- The program then checks for the smallest number `j` that has less than 2 occurrences in `a` to ensure that the MEX is maximized while considering Bob's optimal moves.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the MEX for each test case based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:
Correctness: **True**
