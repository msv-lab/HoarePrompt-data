You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves a series of attacks on a list of ships with specific durability values. The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ships, reducing their durability by 1 each time until they sink (durability reaches 0). We need to determine how many ships are sunk after a given number of attacks.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the provided code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
   - It then reads the list of durability values `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `l` and `r` are initialized to point to the first and last ships, respectively.
   - `sunks` keeps track of the number of ships that have sunk.
   - The main loop continues as long as `l <= r` and `k > 0`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `l == r` (only one ship left).
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of the last ship, it sinks the ship and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `l != r`, it compares the durability of the first and last ships.
     - If the durability of the first ship (`a[l]`) is less than or equal to that of the last ship (`a[r]`):
       - It checks if `k` is sufficient to sink both ships.
         - If yes, it reduces `k` by twice the durability of the first ship, updates the durability of the last ship, and adjusts `l` and `r` accordingly.
         - If `k` is exactly enough to sink the first ship but not the last, it sinks the first ship and breaks out of the loop.
     - If the durability of the last ship is less than that of the first ship, it performs a similar check and update for the last ship.
   - The loop terminates when all ships are sunk or there are no more attacks left.

### Issues in the Code
1. **Handling of Remaining Attacks:**
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where `k` is greater than the total number of attacks required to sink all ships.
   - For example, if `k` is very large, the code should simply sink all ships and return `n` as the result.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle the case where `n == 1` correctly. If there is only one ship, the Kraken will attack it until it sinks, regardless of the value of `k`.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - The code uses a while loop to simulate each attack, which can be inefficient for large values of `k` (up to \(10^{15}\)). Instead, it should calculate the number of attacks required to sink each ship and handle the remaining attacks accordingly.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the code does not correctly handle all edge cases and is not efficient for large values of `k`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
