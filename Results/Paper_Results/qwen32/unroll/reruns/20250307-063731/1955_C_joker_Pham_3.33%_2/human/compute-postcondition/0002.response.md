The `while` loop condition provided is `l <= r`. To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, the condition `l <= r` must be true right before the loop begins. Given the initial states:

- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9
- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `sunks` is 0

We need to ensure that `l <= r` is true. Since `l` is initialized to 0 and `r` is initialized to `n - 1`, for any valid `n` (which is at least 1), `l` will always be less than or equal to `r`. This is because `n - 1` is always greater than or equal to 0 when `n` is at least 1.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `l` and `r` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 0**
