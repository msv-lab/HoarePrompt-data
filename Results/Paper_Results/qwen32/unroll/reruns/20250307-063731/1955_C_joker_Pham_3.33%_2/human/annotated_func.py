    #The program returns the value of `sunks`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`; `k`, an integer; and `a`, a list of `n` integers. The function calculates and returns the maximum number of pairs of elements from the list `a` that can be "sunk" such that the sum of twice the smaller element in each pair does not exceed `k`. If a single element can be sunk alone when `k` is sufficient, it is also counted. The function modifies the list `a` in the process but the final state of `a` is not specified as part of the functionality.
