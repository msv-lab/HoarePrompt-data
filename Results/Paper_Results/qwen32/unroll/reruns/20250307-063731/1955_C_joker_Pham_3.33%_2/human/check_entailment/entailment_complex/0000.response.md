### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided function `func_1` to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The function `func_1` is supposed to simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships and count how many ships sink. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `l` and `r` are initialized to point to the first and last ship in the list, respectively.
   - `sunks` keeps track of the number of ships that have sunk.

2. **Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l <= r` and `k > 0`.
   - If `l == r`, it means there's only one ship left to attack. If `k >= a[r]`, that ship will sink.
   - If `a[l] <= a[r]`, the Kraken attacks the first ship (`a[l]`):
     - If `k >= a[l] * 2`, the Kraken can attack both the first and last ships. It reduces the durability of the first ship to 0 and subtracts its durability from the last ship. If the last ship's durability drops to 0, it also sinks.
     - If `k == a[l] * 2 - 1`, only the first ship sinks.
   - If `a[r] < a[l]`, the logic is similar but the Kraken attacks the last ship (`a[r]`):
     - If `k >= a[r] * 2`, the Kraken can attack both the first and last ships. It reduces the durability of the last ship to 0 and subtracts its durability from the first ship. If the first ship's durability drops to 0, it also sinks.
     - If `k == a[r] * 2 - 1`, only the last ship sinks.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is not sufficient for a full attack cycle (`a[l] * 2` or `a[r] * 2`), the loop breaks.
   - If `k == 0`, the loop also breaks.

### Issues:
- The function does not correctly handle the scenario where the Kraken can only partially attack a ship. For example, if `k < a[l]` or `k < a[r]`, the ship should still be attacked, but its durability should be reduced by `k`, and the Kraken should stop attacking.
- The function does not correctly account for the scenario where `k` is exactly enough to sink one ship but not two. For example, if `k == a[l]` and `k == a[r]`, both ships should sink, but the function might only sink one.
- The function does not correctly handle the scenario where `k` is just enough to sink ships in a sequence without fully attacking pairs.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks and count the number of ships that sink. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
