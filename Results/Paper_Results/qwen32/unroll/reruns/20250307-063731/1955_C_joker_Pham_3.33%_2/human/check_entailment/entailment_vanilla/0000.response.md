Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves a series of attacks on a list of ships with specific durability values. The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ships, reducing their durability by 1 each time until they sink (durability reaches 0). We need to determine how many ships are sunk after a given number of attacks.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the provided code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
   - It then reads the list of durability values `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `l` and `r` are initialized to point to the first and last ships, respectively.
   - `sunks` keeps track of the number of ships that have sunk.
   - The main loop continues as long as `l <= r` and `k > 0`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `l == r` (only one ship left).
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of the last ship, it sinks the ship and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `l != r`, it compares the durability of the first and last ships.
     - If the durability of the first ship (`a[l]`) is less than or equal to that of the last ship (`a[r]`):
       - It checks if `k` is sufficient to sink both ships.
         - If yes, it reduces `k` by twice the durability of the first ship, updates the durability of the last ship, and adjusts `l` and `r` accordingly.
         - If `k` is exactly enough to sink the first ship but not the last, it sinks the first ship and breaks out of the loop.
     - If the durability of the last ship is less than that of the first ship, it performs a similar check and update for the last ship.
   - The loop terminates when all ships are sunk or there are no more attacks left.

### Issues in the Code
1. **Handling of Remaining Attacks:**
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where `k` is greater than the total number of attacks required to sink all ships.
   - For example, if `k` is very large, the code should simply sink all ships and return `n` as the result.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle the case where `n == 1` correctly. If there is only one ship, the Kraken will attack it until it sinks, regardless of the value of `k`.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - The code uses a while loop to simulate each attack, which can be inefficient for large values of `k` (up to \(10^{15}\)). Instead, it should calculate the number of attacks required to sink each ship and handle the remaining attacks accordingly.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the code does not correctly handle all edge cases and is not efficient for large values of `k`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
