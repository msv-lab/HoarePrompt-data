### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken after `k` attacks. The Kraken alternates its attacks between the first and last ships in the list, reducing their durability by 1 each time. When a ship's durability drops to 0, it is considered sunk and is no longer attacked.

Let's break down the logic of the provided function `func_1(n, k, a)`:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `l` and `r` are initialized to point to the first and last ships, respectively.
   - `sunks` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of ships that have sunk.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l <= r` and `k > 0`.
   - If `l == r`, it means there's only one ship left. If the remaining attacks `k` are enough to sink this ship (`k >= a[r]`), it increments `sunks` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the durability of the first ship `a[l]` is less than or equal to that of the last ship `a[r]`:
     - It checks if the remaining attacks `k` are enough to sink both ships (`k >= a[l] * 2`).
     - If yes, it subtracts `a[l] * 2` from `k`, reduces the durability of the last ship by `a[l]`, and checks if the last ship has sunk (`a[r] == 0`). If it has, it increments `sunks` and moves the pointer `r` to the left.
     - It then increments `sunks` for the first ship and moves the pointer `l` to the right.
     - If the remaining attacks are exactly enough to sink the first ship but not the last (`a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`), it increments `sunks` and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it breaks out of the loop.
   - If the durability of the last ship `a[r]` is less than that of the first ship `a[l]`:
     - It follows similar logic as above, but this time it checks if the remaining attacks are enough to sink both ships (`k >= a[r] * 2`), and adjusts the pointers and `sunks` accordingly.
     - If the remaining attacks are exactly enough to sink the last ship but not the first (`a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`), it increments `sunks` and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Return**:
   - The function returns the number of ships that have sunk (`sunks`).

### Analysis of the Program:

The logic seems correct and efficiently handles the alternating attacks on the first and last ships. However, there are a few points to consider:

- The condition `if k == 0` is checked multiple times, which is redundant and can be removed.
- The conditions for exact matches (`a[l] * 2 - 1 == k` and `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`) are correctly handled.
- The program correctly updates the pointers `l` and `r` and the `sunks` counter based on the remaining durability of the ships and the number of attacks left.

### Conclusion:

The provided program appears to correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks and determine the number of ships sunk. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
