Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and `pq` is a heap of tuples where each tuple is (price, i) for each price in `prices` and its index `i`. `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` is 0.**

The variable `tickets_bought` has been initialized to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
