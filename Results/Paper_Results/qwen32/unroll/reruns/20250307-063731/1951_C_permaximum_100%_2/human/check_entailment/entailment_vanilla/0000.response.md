To determine if the given Python program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets over `n` days, given that:
- The price of tickets changes based on the number of tickets bought on a previous day.
- We can buy a maximum of `m` tickets per day.

### Program Analysis
The program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets on the day with the lowest current price. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with tuples of `(price, day)` for each day.
   - It also initializes `total_cost`, `tickets_bought`, and `price_increase` to 0.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues until we have bought `k` tickets.
   - In each iteration, it pops the day with the lowest current price from the heap.
   - It calculates the current price by adding the `price_increase` to the popped price.
   - It determines the number of tickets to buy on that day, which is the minimum of `m` (max tickets per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - It updates the `total_cost` by adding the cost of the tickets bought on that day.
   - It updates the `tickets_bought` and `price_increase` accordingly.

3. **Heap Update**:
   - The program does not reinsert the day into the heap after buying tickets, which is correct because the price of tickets on subsequent days will be higher due to the `price_increase`, and we would not want to buy tickets on that day again.

### Correctness Verification
- **Optimal Choice**: The program consistently buys tickets on the day with the lowest current price, which is a greedy approach that works optimally for this problem.
- **Price Increase Handling**: The program correctly updates the price increase after each purchase, ensuring that the prices for subsequent days are adjusted accordingly.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as buying the maximum number of tickets per day (`m`) and buying tickets over multiple days until `k` tickets are bought.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets under the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
