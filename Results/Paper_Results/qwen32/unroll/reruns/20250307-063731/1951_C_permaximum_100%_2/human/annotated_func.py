#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), and prices is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    pq = [(price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        price += price_increase
        
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        
    #State: total_cost, tickets_bought, price_increase = the final computed total cost, k, k.
    return total_cost
    #The program returns the final computed total cost
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of items), `m` (a multiplier or limit), `k` (the maximum number of tickets to buy), and `prices` (a list of prices for the items). It calculates and returns the total cost of buying up to `k` tickets, where the price of each ticket increases with each purchase. The final state of the program is the total cost of the tickets bought.
