The code `heapq.heapify(pq)` transforms the list `pq` into a heap in-place. This means that the list `pq` will now satisfy the heap property, where the smallest element is at the root of the heap (i.e., at index 0).

The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` remain unchanged. The list `pq` is now a heap.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and `pq` is a heap of tuples where each tuple is (price, i) for each price in `prices` and its index `i`.**
