To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the operations performed within the loop and their cumulative effects.

### Loop Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `tickets_bought` is less than `k`. This means the loop will run until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.

2. **Heap Operations**:
   - `heapq.heappop(pq)`: This pops the smallest element from the heap `pq`, which is a tuple `(price, i)`. This `price` is the current price of the ticket, and `i` is the index of the ticket in the `prices` list.
   - `price += price_increase`: The `price` is increased by `price_increase`.

3. **Buying Tickets**:
   - `tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)`: This determines how many tickets to buy in the current iteration. It is the minimum of `m` (the maximum number of tickets that can be bought at once) and the remaining number of tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - `total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy`: The cost of the tickets bought is added to `total_cost`.
   - `tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy`: The number of tickets bought in this iteration is added to `tickets_bought`.

4. **Increasing Price**:
   - `price_increase += tickets_to_buy`: The `price_increase` is incremented by the number of tickets bought in this iteration.

### Final State

After the loop finishes, all `k` tickets have been bought. The variables that have changed are `total_cost`, `tickets_bought`, and `price_increase`.

- `total_cost`: This will be the sum of the prices of all `k` tickets, each price adjusted by the `price_increase` incurred up to that point.
- `tickets_bought`: This will be equal to `k`, as the loop runs until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
- `price_increase`: This will be the total number of tickets bought, i.e., `k`.

### Output State

Output State: **total_cost, tickets_bought, price_increase = the final computed total cost, k, k.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop, `tickets_bought` will be equal to `k`, `price_increase` will be equal to `k`, and `total_cost` will be the sum of the prices of the `k` tickets bought, with each price adjusted by the cumulative `price_increase` up to the point of purchase.
