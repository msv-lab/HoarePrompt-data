Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets that can be bought in a single day is limited by both the maximum allowed (`m`) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`). The code always attempts to buy `min(m, k - tickets_bought)` tickets, but it does not reinsert the updated price back into the priority queue, which can lead to incorrect results.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 1 3
1 2 3
```
In this case, the code will:
1. Buy 1 ticket on day 1 for 1 unit, increasing the price for the remaining days to [3, 4, 5].
2. Buy 1 ticket on day 2 for 3 units, increasing the price for the remaining days to [6, 7].
3. Buy 1 ticket on day 3 for 6 units.

Total cost = 1 + 3 + 6 = 10.

However, the optimal solution would be to:
1. Buy 1 ticket on day 1 for 1 unit, increasing the price for the remaining days to [3, 4, 5].
2. Buy 1 ticket on day 2 for 3 units, increasing the price for the remaining days to [6, 7].
3. Buy 1 ticket on day 3 for 5 units (not 6, because the price on day 3 is updated after day 2's purchase).

Total cost = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.

The code should reinsert the updated price back into the priority queue after each purchase to ensure that the next cheapest option is always considered. This is crucial because the price of the tickets can change dynamically based on previous purchases.

The code should be modified to reinsert the updated price into the priority queue after each purchase. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import heapq

def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        # Reinsert the updated price back into the priority queue
        heapq.heappush(pq, (prices[day] + price_increase, day))
    return total_cost

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
    print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that the priority queue always contains the current cheapest option, taking into account the price increases from previous purchases.
