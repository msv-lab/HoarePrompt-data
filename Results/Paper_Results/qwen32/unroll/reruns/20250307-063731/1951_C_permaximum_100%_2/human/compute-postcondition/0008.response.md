Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of items), `m` (an integer representing a multiplier or limit), `k` (an integer representing the maximum allowed total cost, with constraints based on `n` and `m`), and `prices` (a list of `n` integers where each integer represents the price of an item). The function computes and returns the final total cost based on these inputs.**
