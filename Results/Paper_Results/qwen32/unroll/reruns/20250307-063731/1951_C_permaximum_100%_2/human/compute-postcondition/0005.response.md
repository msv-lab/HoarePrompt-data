The only variable in the loop head is `tickets_bought`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tickets_bought`. If `tickets_bought` is less than `k`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tickets_bought` is 0. Since `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `k` is always greater than 0. Therefore, `tickets_bought` needs to be adjusted to be less than `k`. The simplest way to ensure this is to keep `tickets_bought` as 0, as it is already less than `k`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and `pq` is a heap of tuples where each tuple is (price, i) for each price in `prices` and its index `i`. `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0**
