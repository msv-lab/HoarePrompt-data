### Reasoning:

The given program `func_1` is designed to determine the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets over `n` days with the constraint that a maximum of `m` tickets can be bought per day, and each purchase increases the price of subsequent tickets.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Priority Queue Initialization**: The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the prices and their corresponding days. This allows the program to always buy tickets from the day with the lowest current price.

2. **Heap Operations**: The program uses the `heapq` module to maintain the priority queue. The `heappop` function is used to get the day with the lowest price. This ensures that the program always makes the most cost-effective purchase at each step.

3. **Price Adjustment**: After popping the lowest price from the heap, the program adjusts the price by adding the `price_increase` to it. This reflects the cumulative increase in price due to previous purchases.

4. **Ticket Purchase Decision**: The program calculates the number of tickets to buy on the current day as the minimum of `m` (the daily limit) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`). This ensures that the program does not exceed the daily limit or the remaining tickets needed.

5. **Cost Calculation**: The program calculates the cost for the current purchase and adds it to the `total_cost`.

6. **Update State**: The program updates the `tickets_bought` and `price_increase` variables. The `tickets_bought` is incremented by the number of tickets purchased, and `price_increase` is incremented by the same amount to reflect the price increase for subsequent days.

7. **Termination**: The loop continues until `tickets_bought` equals `k`, meaning the program has purchased the required number of tickets. At this point, the program returns the `total_cost`.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Optimal Purchase Strategy**: The use of a priority queue ensures that the program always buys tickets from the day with the lowest current price, which is a greedy strategy that minimizes the total cost.
- **Constraints Handling**: The program correctly handles the constraints by ensuring that no more than `m` tickets are bought per day and that the price increases correctly after each purchase.
- **Edge Cases**: The program is designed to handle edge cases such as when `k` is very small or very large, and when the prices are uniform or highly variable.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic to find the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
