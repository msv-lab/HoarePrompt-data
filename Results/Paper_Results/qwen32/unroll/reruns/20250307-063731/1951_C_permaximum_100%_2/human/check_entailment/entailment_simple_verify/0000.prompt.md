You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets that can be bought in a single day is limited by both the maximum allowed (`m`) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`). The code always attempts to buy `min(m, k - tickets_bought)` tickets, but it does not reinsert the updated price back into the priority queue, which can lead to incorrect results.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 1 3
1 2 3
```
In this case, the code will:
1. Buy 1 ticket on day 1 for 1 unit, increasing the price for the remaining days to [3, 4, 5].
2. Buy 1 ticket on day 2 for 3 units, increasing the price for the remaining days to [6, 7].
3. Buy 1 ticket on day 3 for 6 units.

Total cost = 1 + 3 + 6 = 10.

However, the optimal solution would be to:
1. Buy 1 ticket on day 1 for 1 unit, increasing the price for the remaining days to [3, 4, 5].
2. Buy 1 ticket on day 2 for 3 units, increasing the price for the remaining days to [6, 7].
3. Buy 1 ticket on day 3 for 5 units (not 6, because the price on day 3 is updated after day 2's purchase).

Total cost = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.

The code should reinsert the updated price back into the priority queue after each purchase to ensure that the next cheapest option is always considered. This is crucial because the price of the tickets can change dynamically based on previous purchases.

The code should be modified to reinsert the updated price into the priority queue after each purchase. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import heapq

def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        # Reinsert the updated price back into the priority queue
        heapq.heappush(pq, (prices[day] + price_increase, day))
    return total_cost

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
    print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that the priority queue always contains the current cheapest option, taking into account the price increases from previous purchases.
