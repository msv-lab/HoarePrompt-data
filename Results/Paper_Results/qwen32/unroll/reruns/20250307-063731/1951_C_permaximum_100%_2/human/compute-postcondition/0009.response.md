Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of items), `m` (a multiplier or limit), `k` (the maximum number of tickets to buy), and `prices` (a list of prices for the items). It calculates and returns the total cost of buying up to `k` tickets, where the price of each ticket increases with each purchase. The final state of the program is the total cost of the tickets bought.**
