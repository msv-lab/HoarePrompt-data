Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the condition that the prices of the tickets increase after a purchase. Specifically, the program does not update the prices in the priority queue correctly after a purchase. Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Priority Queue Update**: After purchasing tickets on a given day, the prices for subsequent days should increase by the number of tickets purchased. However, the program does not update the prices in the priority queue to reflect this increase. The priority queue should be updated to include the new prices for the remaining days after each purchase.

2. **Re-insertion into Priority Queue**: After a purchase, the new price for the day should be re-inserted into the priority queue. This is not done in the provided program, leading to incorrect calculations.

To fix the program, you should:
- After a purchase, update the prices for the remaining days by adding the number of tickets purchased to the price of each subsequent day.
- Re-insert the updated prices back into the priority queue.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
import heapq

def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        # Update the prices for the remaining days
        for i in range(day + 1, n):
            prices[i] += tickets_to_buy
        # Re-insert the updated prices back into the priority queue
        for i in range(day + 1, n):
            heapq.heappush(pq, (prices[i], i))
    return total_cost

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
    print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that the prices are updated correctly after each purchase and re-inserted into the priority queue, leading to the correct minimum cost calculation.
