### Reasoning:

The given problem requires finding the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days, where the price of tickets increases based on the number of tickets purchased on previous days. The provided program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets on the day with the lowest current price, which is a greedy approach.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of days (`n`), the maximum tickets that can be bought per day (`m`), and the total number of tickets to buy (`k`).
   - It also reads the list of ticket prices for each day.

2. **Heap Construction**:
   - The program constructs a min-heap (priority queue) where each element is a tuple containing the price of a ticket and its corresponding day index.
   - This allows the program to efficiently retrieve the day with the lowest ticket price.

3. **Buying Tickets**:
   - The program initializes the total cost to 0 and the number of tickets bought to 0.
   - It also keeps track of the price increase, which starts at 0 and increases by the number of tickets bought on each day.
   - The program enters a loop where it repeatedly buys tickets until the required number (`k`) is bought.
   - In each iteration, the program pops the day with the lowest current ticket price from the heap.
   - It calculates the current price of a ticket on that day, considering the accumulated price increase.
   - It determines the number of tickets to buy on that day (the minimum of `m` and the remaining tickets needed).
   - It updates the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets bought on that day.
   - It updates the number of tickets bought and the price increase accordingly.

4. **Output**:
   - After buying all the required tickets, the program prints the total cost for that test case.

### Analysis:

The greedy approach of always buying tickets on the day with the lowest current price is optimal for this problem because it minimizes the cost at each step, leading to the minimum overall cost. The use of a min-heap ensures that the day with the lowest price can be retrieved efficiently.

The program handles the constraints and edge cases correctly:
- It ensures that no more than `m` tickets are bought per day.
- It correctly updates the price increase after each purchase.
- It handles multiple test cases efficiently.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and produces the correct output for the given examples.

**Correctness: True**
