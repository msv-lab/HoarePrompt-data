t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and the second element is a list of n-1 integers x_2, x_3, ..., x_n, where each x_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
