The code snippet reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The initial state mentions that the input consists of multiple test cases, each starting with an integer `n` and followed by `n-1` integers. The variable `t` is the only one being updated by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, and the input consists of multiple test cases where each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in array `a`, and the next line contains `n-1` integers `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) representing the elements of array `x`. The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
