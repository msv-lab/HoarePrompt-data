Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in an array, followed by `n-1` integers `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) representing the elements of the array. The function processes these test cases and returns the missing element from the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` in each test case.**
