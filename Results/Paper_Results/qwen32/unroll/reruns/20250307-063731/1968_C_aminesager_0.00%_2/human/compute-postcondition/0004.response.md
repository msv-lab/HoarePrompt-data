Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and `n-1` integers. It calculates and prints an array `a` of length `n` such that the difference between consecutive elements matches the given `n-1` integers in reverse order, starting with the initial element of `a` set to 1000.**
