To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the provided code and the input-output process step-by-step.

### Code Breakdown:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - Read `n`, the number of elements in array `a`.
     - Read `n-1` integers representing the elements of array `T`.

2. **Array `a` Construction:**
   - Initialize `a` with the first element as `1000`.
   - For each subsequent element in `a` (from index `1` to `n-1`), compute the value using the formula `a[i] = a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.
   - Reverse the array `a`.

3. **Output:**
   - Convert the array `a` to a space-separated string and print it.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's consider an example to understand the process better.

**Input:**
```
2
3
1 2
4
3 2 1
```
**Execution Steps:**

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 3`
   - `T = [1, 2]`
   - Initialize `a = [1000]`
   - Compute `a[1] = a[0] - T[0] = 1000 - 1 = 999`
   - Compute `a[2] = a[1] - T[1] = 999 - 2 = 997`
   - Reverse `a` → `a = [997, 999, 1000]`
   - Output: `997 999 1000`

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 4`
   - `T = [3, 2, 1]`
   - Initialize `a = [1000]`
   - Compute `a[1] = a[0] - T[0] = 1000 - 3 = 997`
   - Compute `a[2] = a[1] - T[1] = 997 - 2 = 995`
   - Compute `a[3] = a[2] - T[2] = 995 - 1 = 994`
   - Reverse `a` → `a = [994, 995, 997, 1000]`
   - Output: `994 995 997 1000`

**Output:**
```
997 999 1000
994 995 997 1000
```

### Output State:
After all test cases have been processed, the output state consists of the printed results for each test case. The variable `t` will be `0` as it gets decremented for each test case until it reaches zero.

**Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
- `t` is `0`.
- The printed results for each test case are the arrays `a` in reverse order, as described in the example.

Output State: **`t` is `0`, and the printed results for each test case are the arrays `a` in reverse order.**
