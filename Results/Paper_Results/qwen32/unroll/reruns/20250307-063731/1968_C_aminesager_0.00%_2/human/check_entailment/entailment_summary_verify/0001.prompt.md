You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
        a = a[::-1]
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and `n-1` integers. It calculates and prints an array `a` of length `n` such that the difference between consecutive elements matches the given `n-1` integers in reverse order, starting with the initial element of `a` set to 1000.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given an array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \).
- We need to find an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that:
  - \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \le i \le n \).
  - \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the length of the array `a`).
   - It then reads the array `x` of length `n-1`.

2. **Array Construction:**
   - The program initializes the array `a` with `[1000]`.
   - For each element in `x`, it calculates the next element in `a` using the formula `a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])`.
   - The array `a` is then reversed before printing.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program's logic for constructing the array `a` needs to ensure that each \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \).
   - The current implementation does not guarantee this property. Specifically, the formula `a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])` does not ensure that \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \).

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:
- **First Test Case:**
  - Input: `n = 4`, `x = [2, 4, 1]`
  - Expected Output: Any array `a` such that:
    - \( a_2 \mod a_1 = 2 \)
    - \( a_3 \mod a_2 = 4 \)
    - \( a_4 \mod a_3 = 1 \)
  - Program Output:
    - `a = [1000]`
    - `a[1] = 1000 - 2 = 998`
    - `a[2] = 998 - 4 = 994`
    - `a[3] = 994 - 1 = 993`
    - Reversed: `a = [993, 994, 998, 1000]`
    - Check:
      - \( 994 \mod 993 \neq 2 \)
      - \( 998 \mod 994 \neq 4 \)
      - \( 1000 \mod 998 \neq 1 \)
  - The program's output does not satisfy the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly construct the array `a` such that \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

Correctness: **False**
