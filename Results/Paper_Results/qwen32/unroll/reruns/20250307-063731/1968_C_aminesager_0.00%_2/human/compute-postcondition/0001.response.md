The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For the `while` loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer.

Given the state right before the loop is `t` is the number of test cases, we need to adjust `t` to be greater than 0 if it isn't already.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
