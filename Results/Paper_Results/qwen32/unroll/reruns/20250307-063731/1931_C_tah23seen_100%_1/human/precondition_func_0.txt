arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
