Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` attempts to determine the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal by considering only the first and last segments of the array that are composed of the same element. However, this approach does not account for the optimal way to make the entire array uniform with the given operation.

The problem requires considering all possible ways to select a segment `[i, j]` and set all its elements to the same value `x` to minimize the cost `(j - i + 1)`. The provided solution does not explore all possible segments and thus might not find the optimal solution.

To solve this problem correctly, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming or a sliding window technique to evaluate all possible segments and their associated costs.
