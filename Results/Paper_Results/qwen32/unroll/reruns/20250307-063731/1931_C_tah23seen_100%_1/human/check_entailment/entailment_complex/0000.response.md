Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task is to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal, using at most one operation that changes a contiguous subarray to a specified value. The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray being changed.

The given function `func_1` does not account for the optimal choice of the subarray to change. Instead, it only considers the longest contiguous segments at the start and end of the array that are already equal to each other, and calculates a value based on those segments. This approach does not guarantee the minimum cost to make the entire array equal.

Let's consider the first example from the problem statement:
```
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
The optimal solution here is to change the subarray `[2, 3, 4, 5]` to `1`, which costs `4` burles. However, the given function would calculate the cost based on the segments at the start and end that are equal (`1` at the start and `1` at the end), resulting in a cost of `4 - 1 - 1 = 2` burles, which is incorrect.

For a correct solution, we would need to consider all possible subarrays and calculate the cost of changing each to a value that could potentially make the entire array equal, then choose the minimum cost among those options.

Correctness: **False**
