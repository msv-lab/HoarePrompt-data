You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: i is 0, n is 1 + 2 * t, j is 2 * t, arr remains the same.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: Output State:
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns the maximum value between the number of elements between indices `i` and `j` minus one, and 0. Given the information, the returned value is at least 0.
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of elements, and the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`.
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the function processes an integer `n` representing the size of the array, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array. For each test case, the function returns the maximum value between the number of elements between indices `i` and `j` minus one and 0. If this value is not applicable, it returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the maximum value between the number of elements between indices `i` and `j` minus one, and 0. Given the information, the returned value is at least 0.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
