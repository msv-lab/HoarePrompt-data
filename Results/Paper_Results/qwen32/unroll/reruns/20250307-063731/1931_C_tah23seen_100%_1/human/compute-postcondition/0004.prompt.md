Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`) representing the elements of the array; `i` is 0; `n` is `1 + 2 * t`; `j` is `2 * t`.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
    i += 1



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
