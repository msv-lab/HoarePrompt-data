Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the function processes an integer `n` representing the size of the array, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array. For each test case, the function returns the maximum value between the number of elements between indices `i` and `j` minus one and 0. If this value is not applicable, it returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j.**
