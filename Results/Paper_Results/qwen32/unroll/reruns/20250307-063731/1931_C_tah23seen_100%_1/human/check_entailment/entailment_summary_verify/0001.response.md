### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and function summary to determine if the solution correctly addresses the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to make all elements of the array equal by applying the operation at most once. The operation involves selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a single value `x`, with the cost being the length of the subarray. The task is to find the minimum cost required to achieve this.

#### Solution Analysis:
The provided function `func_1(arr)` attempts to find the minimum cost by considering two main scenarios:
1. **If the first and last elements of the array are the same**: The function calculates the cost of changing the middle segment (if any) between the first and last segments of equal elements.
2. **If the first and last elements of the array are different**: The function calculates the cost of changing the segment from the start to the last change or from the first change to the end.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary describes the logic of finding the first and last segments of equal elements and calculating the cost based on whether the first and last elements are the same or different.

#### Issues in the Solution:
Let's examine the provided examples and the logic:

1. **Example 1**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`
   - `i` will be `0` (as `arr[0] == arr[1]` is false).
   - `j` will be `5` (as `arr[5] == arr[4]` is false).
   - Since `arr[0] != arr[-1]`, the function calculates `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`, which is `max(min(5, 5), 0) = 5`.
   - The correct cost should be `4` (changing the subarray `[2, 3, 4, 5]` to `1`).

2. **Example 2**: `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`
   - `i` will be `2` (as `arr[2] == arr[3]` is false).
   - `j` will be `3` (as `arr[3] == arr[4]` is false).
   - Since `arr[0] != arr[-1]`, the function calculates `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`, which is `max(min(5, 3), 0) = 3`.
   - The correct cost should be `2` (changing the subarray `[1, 2]` to `8`).

3. **Example 3**: `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`
   - `i` will be `0` (as `arr[0] == arr[1]` is false).
   - `j` will be `6` (as `arr[6] == arr[5]` is false).
   - Since `arr[0] != arr[-1]`, the function calculates `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`, which is `max(min(6, 6), 0) = 6`.
   - The correct cost should be `4` (changing the subarray `[4, 3, 2, 7]` to `1`).

4. **Example 4**: `[9, 9, 2, 9, 2, 5, 5, 5, 3]`
   - `i` will be `1` (as `arr[1] == arr[2]` is false).
   - `j` will be `7` (as `arr[7] == arr[8]` is false).
   - Since `arr[0] != arr[-1]`, the function calculates `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`, which is `max(min(8, 7), 0) = 7`.
   - The correct cost should be `6` (changing the subarray `[2, 9, 2, 5, 5, 5]` to `9`).

From the above examples, it is clear that the function does not correctly calculate the minimum cost in several cases. The logic does not consider the optimal subarray to change to make the entire array uniform with the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases, especially for non-uniform arrays. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
