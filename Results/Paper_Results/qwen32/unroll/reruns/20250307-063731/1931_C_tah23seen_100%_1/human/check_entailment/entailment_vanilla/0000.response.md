Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the given Python program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

We are given an array `a` of `n` integers, and we need to make all elements of the array equal by applying the operation at most once. The operation allows us to select a subarray defined by indices `i` and `j` and set all elements in this subarray to a value `x`. The cost of this operation is `(j - i + 1)` burles. Our goal is to minimize the cost of making all elements of the array equal.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution involves the function `func_1(arr)`, which is supposed to determine the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal by applying the operation at most once. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in `func_1(arr)`:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `i` is initialized to 0, and `j` is initialized to `n - 1` (the last index of the array).

2. **Finding the First Change**:
   - The first `while` loop increments `i` as long as `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This loop effectively finds the first index `i` where the value changes from the start of the array.

3. **Finding the Last Change**:
   - The second `while` loop decrements `j` as long as `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`. This loop effectively finds the last index `j` where the value changes from the end of the array.

4. **Checking if the Ends are Equal**:
   - If `arr[0] == arr[-1]`, it means the array can be made uniform by only changing the middle segment (if any). The cost in this case is `max(j - i - 1, 0)`, which is the length of the middle segment that needs to be changed.

5. **If Ends are Different**:
   - If `arr[0] != arr[-1]`, the array cannot be made uniform by just changing the middle segment. The solution suggests using the minimum of two options:
     - Changing the segment from the start to the last change (`n - i - 1`).
     - Changing the segment from the first change to the end (`j`).

### Issues in the Solution

The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases. Here are some issues:

- **Handling Uniform Arrays**: If the entire array is already uniform (`arr[0] == arr[-1]` and all elements are the same), the solution correctly returns `0`. This part seems correct.
  
- **Handling Non-Uniform Arrays**: However, when the array is not uniform, the solution does not consider the best possible segment to change to make the array uniform. The current logic does not guarantee the minimum cost. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The solution might incorrectly return `4` instead of the correct answer `3` (changing the segment `[2, 3, 4]` to `1`).

### Conclusion

The solution does not correctly handle all cases, especially non-uniform arrays. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
