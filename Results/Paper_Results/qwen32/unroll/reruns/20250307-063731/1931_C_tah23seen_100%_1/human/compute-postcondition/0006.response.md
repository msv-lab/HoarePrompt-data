To determine the output state, let's analyze the given loop and initial state.

**Initial State:** 
- `i` is 0
- `n` is `1 + 2 * t`
- `j` is `2 * t`
- `arr` remains the same (the specific contents of `arr` are not provided, but we know it does not change)

**Loop Code:**
```python
while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
    j -= 1
```

**Loop Analysis:**
- The loop condition is `j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`. This means the loop will continue as long as `j` is greater than 0 and the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in `arr` are equal.
- Inside the loop, `j` is decremented by 1 (`j -= 1`).

**Output State Determination:**
- The loop will stop when either `j` is no longer greater than 0 or the elements at index `j` and `j - 1` in `arr` are not equal.
- Since `j` starts at `2 * t` and is decremented by 1 in each iteration, the loop will terminate when `j` becomes 0 or when it finds a pair of elements in `arr` that are not equal.

**Final Output State:**
- `i` remains 0 (unchanged by the loop).
- `n` remains `1 + 2 * t` (unchanged by the loop).
- `j` will be the smallest index such that `arr[j] != arr[j - 1]` or 0 if all elements from index `2 * t` to 0 are equal.
- `arr` remains the same (unchanged by the loop).

**Output State:**
Output State: **i is 0, n is 1 + 2 * t, j is the smallest index such that arr[j] != arr[j - 1] or 0 if all elements from index 2 * t to 0 are equal, arr remains the same.**

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `i` and `n` stay the same, `j` will point to the first index where the sequence of equal elements in `arr` stops or will be 0 if all elements from `2 * t` to 0 are the same, and `arr` remains unchanged.
