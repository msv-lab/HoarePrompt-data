The provided code snippet assigns the length of the list `arr` to the variable `n`. The length of `arr` represents the total number of elements in the list, including the first element which is `t` (the number of test cases).

Given that `arr` initially contains `t` followed by pairs of lines for each test case, the length of `arr` (`n`) will be `1 + 2 * t` because there is one line for `t` and each test case contributes two lines (one for `n` and one for the list of integers).

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`) representing the elements of the array; `i` is 0; `n` is `1 + 2 * t`.**
