arr is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the elements of the array. The first element of each inner list is the integer n, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
