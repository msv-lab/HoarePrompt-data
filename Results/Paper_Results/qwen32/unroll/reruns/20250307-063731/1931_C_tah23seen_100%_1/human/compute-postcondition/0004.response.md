Let's analyze the given loop and the initial state to determine the output state.

### Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases.
- Following `t`, there are `t` pairs of lines. Each pair consists of:
  - The first line of each pair contains a single integer `n` representing the size of the array.
  - The second line contains `n` integers representing the elements of the array.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is `1 + 2 * t`.
- `j` is `2 * t`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop is:
```python
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
    i += 1
```

#### Loop Condition:
- `i < len(arr) - 1`: This ensures that `i` does not go out of bounds when checking `arr[i + 1]`.
- `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`: This condition checks if the current element is equal to the next element.

#### Loop Body:
- `i += 1`: This increments the index `i` by 1.

### Purpose of the Loop:
The loop increments `i` as long as the current element in `arr` is equal to the next element. Essentially, it skips over consecutive duplicate elements starting from index `i`.

### Output State:
Given the initial structure of `arr`, the first element `t` is the number of test cases and is not followed by a duplicate since it is a single integer. Therefore, the loop will not run because `arr[0]` (which is `t`) is not equal to `arr[1]` (which is `n` of the first test case).

Thus, the value of `i` will remain 0 after the loop.

### Final Output State:
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
- The elements of `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **i is 0, n is 1 + 2 * t, j is 2 * t, arr remains the same.**

In natural language, after the loop executes, the index `i` remains 0 because the first element `t` is not equal to the next element `n`. The values of `n` and `j` remain the same, and the array `arr` is unchanged.
