Let's analyze the provided program and its logic against the problem description to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining the minimum cost in burles to make all elements of an array equal using at most one operation that can set a subarray to a specific value. The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it uses a function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: It initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
2. **Finding the first differing element from the start**: It increments `i` until it finds an element different from the first element.
3. **Finding the first differing element from the end**: It decrements `j` until it finds an element different from the last element.
4. **Comparison and return**:
   - If the first and last elements are the same, it returns the maximum of `j - i - 1` and 0. This is because if the first and last elements are the same, the cost to make the whole array equal can be determined by the longest subarray of different elements in between.
   - If the first and last elements are different, it returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of `(n - i - 1)` and `j`. This accounts for the cost of changing either the beginning or the end of the array to match the middle part.

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify if the logic matches the problem statement.

- **Case 1: All elements are the same** (e.g., `[1, 1, 1, 1]`):
  - The function should return 0 because no operation is needed.
  - The function will return 0 because `arr[0] == arr[-1]` and `j - i - 1` will be negative or 0.

- **Case 2: First and last elements are the same, but some elements in between are different** (e.g., `[1, 2, 1]`):
  - The function should return the length of the subarray that needs to be changed minus one.
  - The function will correctly return `1` because `j - i - 1` will be `1`.

- **Case 3: First and last elements are different** (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`):
  - The function should return the minimum cost of changing either the start or the end to match the middle.
  - The function will correctly return `2` because `min(n - i - 1, j)` will be `2`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` appears to correctly handle the logic described in the problem statement for the given examples. The logic considers the cost of changing the subarray to make the entire array equal with a single operation.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
Correctness: **True**
