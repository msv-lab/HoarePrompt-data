Postcondition: **`tree` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key is a node (integer from 1 to n) and each value is a list of adjacent nodes; `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged; `leaves` is a list of nodes with exactly one adjacent node in the `tree`; `dist1` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[0]`; `dist2` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[1]`. Additionally, both `dist1` and `dist2` are even numbers.**
