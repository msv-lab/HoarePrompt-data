The code snippet creates a set named `visited` and initializes it with the `start` node. This means that the `start` node is now marked as visited. The other variables (`start`, `target`, `tree`, and `queue`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is an adjacency list representing the tree structure with n nodes; `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`; `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.**
