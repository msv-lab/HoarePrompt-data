You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, edges is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers u and v such that 1 <= u, v <= n, and start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `tree` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key is a node (integer from 1 to n) and each value is a list of adjacent nodes, representing the connections between nodes as specified by the `edges` list. The values of `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 1 or dist2 % 2 == 1) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns 'Hermione'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of nodes, a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges between the nodes, and an integer `start` representing the starting node. Based on these inputs, the function returns 'Ron' in Case_1 or 'Hermione' in Case_2.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'Ron'

Case_2: The program returns 'Hermione'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
