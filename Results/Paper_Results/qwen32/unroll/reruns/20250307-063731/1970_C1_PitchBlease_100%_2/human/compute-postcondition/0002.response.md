The `while` loop in the provided code will execute as long as the `queue` is not empty. The loop head only involves the `queue` variable, so we need to ensure that the `queue` is not empty for the loop to execute the first time.

Given the initial state:
- `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n.
- `tree` is an adjacency list representing the tree structure with n nodes.
- `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`.
- `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.

The `queue` is already initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`, which means it is not empty. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the `queue` to ensure that the loop can execute the first time.

State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is an adjacency list representing the tree structure with n nodes; `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`; `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.**
