Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` representing the number of nodes, a list of tuples `edges` representing the connections between the nodes, and an integer `start` representing the starting node. It determines the shortest paths from the starting node to two leaf nodes and returns 'Ron' if at least one of these paths has an odd length, otherwise it returns 'Hermione'.**
