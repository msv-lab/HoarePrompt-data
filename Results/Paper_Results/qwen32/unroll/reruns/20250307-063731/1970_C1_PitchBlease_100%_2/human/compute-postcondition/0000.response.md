Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n. `tree` is an adjacency list representing the tree structure with n nodes. `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`.**

Natural language: The initial state of `start` and `target` as integers representing node indices in the tree, and `tree` as an adjacency list, remains unchanged. A new variable `queue` is introduced as a deque containing a single tuple, where the first element of the tuple is the value of `start` and the second element is `0`.
