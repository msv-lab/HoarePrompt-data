### Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is designed to count the minimum number of deletions required to make a string `s` beautiful by removing the substrings "map" and "pie". Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function's logic and correctness:

1. **Initial Check for 'mapie'**:
   - The function first checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If it is, the function returns 1. However, this is incorrect because removing one character (e.g., 'm') from "mapie" will make it "apie", which still contains "pie" and should not be considered a valid solution. The correct approach would be to treat "mapie" as two separate substrings "map" and "pie", each requiring one deletion. Hence, the function should return 2 for "mapie", not 1. This is a logical error in the function.

2. **Removing 'map'**:
   - The function then enters a loop that repeatedly finds and removes the substring "map" from `s`, incrementing the `ans` counter each time. This part of the function is correct in that it removes all occurrences of "map" and counts the deletions required.

3. **Removing 'pie'**:
   - Similarly, the function enters another loop that repeatedly finds and removes the substring "pie" from `s`, incrementing the `ans` counter each time. This part of the function is also correct in that it removes all occurrences of "pie" and counts the deletions required.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, the function returns the total count of deletions required to remove all "map" and "pie" substrings.

### Conclusion:
The function has a logical error in the initial check for the string "mapie". It incorrectly returns 1 when it should return 2. This error makes the function incorrect for the given problem statement.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
