Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the minimum number of characters to be removed to make the string `s` beautiful. Here's the step-by-step analysis of `func_1`:
   - The function first checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If it is, it returns 1. However, this is incorrect because removing one character from "mapie" to make it beautiful is not the correct approach. The correct approach would be to remove 2 characters, for example, to make it "mape" or "maie", which does not contain "map" or "pie". This special case should be removed.
   - The function then enters a loop to remove all occurrences of the substring "map" by finding the first occurrence of "map" and removing it by slicing the string. It increments the `ans` counter each time it removes "map".
   - Similarly, it enters another loop to remove all occurrences of the substring "pie" and increments the `ans` counter each time it removes "pie".
   - The function returns the total number of removals `ans`.

3. **Correctness of the Approach**: The approach of repeatedly finding and removing the substrings "map" and "pie" is correct in the sense that it will eventually make the string beautiful. However, the order and method of removal can be optimized. For example, removing "map" and "pie" in any order will always lead to the correct answer, but the provided code does not handle the special case of "mapie" correctly. The special case should be removed, and the rest of the logic is correct.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as strings with no "map" or "pie" substrings (which should return 0) and strings that are already beautiful.

5. **Efficiency**: The program is efficient enough given the constraints. It processes each string in linear time relative to its length, which is acceptable given that the sum of all string lengths does not exceed \(10^6\).

6. **Output**: The program outputs the correct number of deletions for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program is mostly correct, but it has an unnecessary and incorrect special case check for the string "mapie". Removing this special case check would make the program fully correct.

Correctness: **False**
