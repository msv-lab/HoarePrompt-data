### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed from a given string `s` to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". The program processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string `s`.

The program works as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
3. It calls the function `func_1(s)` to determine the minimum number of deletions required to make `s` beautiful.

The function `func_1(s)`:
1. Checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If so, it incorrectly returns 1, which is not consistent with the problem's requirements (the correct answer should be 2 since both "map" and "pie" need to be removed).
2. Initializes a counter `ans` to count the number of deletions.
3. Uses a `while` loop to find and remove all occurrences of the substring "map" from `s`, incrementing `ans` each time an occurrence is found and removed.
4. Uses another `while` loop to find and remove all occurrences of the substring "pie" from `s`, incrementing `ans` each time an occurrence is found and removed.
5. Returns the final count `ans`.

The issue lies in the first condition of the function `func_1(s)` where it incorrectly returns 1 for the string "mapie". This is because the string "mapie" contains both "map" and "pie", and thus both substrings need to be removed, resulting in 2 deletions.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of the specific case where the string is "mapie".

Correctness: **False**
