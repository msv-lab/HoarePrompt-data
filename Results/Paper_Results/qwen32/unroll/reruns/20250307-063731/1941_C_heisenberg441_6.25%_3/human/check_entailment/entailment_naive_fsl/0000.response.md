Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not handle the problem correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the minimum number of deletions is made to remove all occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie". The current implementation only removes the first occurrence of "map" or "pie" in each iteration and counts it as one deletion, which can lead to suboptimal solutions.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
8
mapiepie
```
The correct answer should be `2` because you can remove the "map" and "pie" substrings in two deletions. However, the provided program will remove the "map" first and then the "pie", resulting in a total of `2` deletions, which is correct in this case. But let's consider another case:

```
1
10
mapmpiepie
```
The correct answer should be `3` because you can remove the "map", "mpie", and "pie" substrings in three deletions. However, the provided program will remove the "map" first, then "pie", and then "pie" again, resulting in a total of `3` deletions, which is correct in this case as well. But let's consider another case:

```
1
10
mpiepiepie
```
The correct answer should be `2` because you can remove the "mpie" and "pie" substrings in two deletions. However, the provided program will remove the "mpie" first, then "pie", and then "pie" again, resulting in a total of `3` deletions, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to ensure that the minimum number of deletions is made to remove all occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie". The current implementation does not guarantee this.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
