You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    if s == 'mapie':
        return 1
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns 1 if the string `s` is exactly 'mapie'. Otherwise, it returns the count of how many times the substrings 'map' and 'pie' were found and removed from the string `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the minimum number of characters to be removed to make the string `s` beautiful. Here's the step-by-step analysis of `func_1`:
   - The function first checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If it is, it returns 1. However, this is incorrect because removing one character from "mapie" to make it beautiful is not the correct approach. The correct approach would be to remove 2 characters, for example, to make it "mape" or "maie", which does not contain "map" or "pie". This special case should be removed.
   - The function then enters a loop to remove all occurrences of the substring "map" by finding the first occurrence of "map" and removing it by slicing the string. It increments the `ans` counter each time it removes "map".
   - Similarly, it enters another loop to remove all occurrences of the substring "pie" and increments the `ans` counter each time it removes "pie".
   - The function returns the total number of removals `ans`.

3. **Correctness of the Approach**: The approach of repeatedly finding and removing the substrings "map" and "pie" is correct in the sense that it will eventually make the string beautiful. However, the order and method of removal can be optimized. For example, removing "map" and "pie" in any order will always lead to the correct answer, but the provided code does not handle the special case of "mapie" correctly. The special case should be removed, and the rest of the logic is correct.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as strings with no "map" or "pie" substrings (which should return 0) and strings that are already beautiful.

5. **Efficiency**: The program is efficient enough given the constraints. It processes each string in linear time relative to its length, which is acceptable given that the sum of all string lengths does not exceed \(10^6\).

6. **Output**: The program outputs the correct number of deletions for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program is mostly correct, but it has an unnecessary and incorrect special case check for the string "mapie". Removing this special case check would make the program fully correct.

Correctness: **False**
