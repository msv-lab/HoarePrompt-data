Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful by removing the substrings "map" and "pie". However, the current implementation has a critical flaw: it does not account for the possibility that removing one occurrence of "map" or "pie" could create a new occurrence of the other substring, which would then need to be removed as well.

For example, consider the string "mappie". The function `func_1` would first remove "map" (resulting in "pie"), then remove "pie" (resulting in an empty string). However, the correct approach is to remove "pie" first (resulting in "map"), and then remove "map", resulting in a total of 2 deletions.

The program also incorrectly returns 1 when the string is exactly "mapie", which is not aligned with the requirement to return the minimum number of deletions.

To correct the program, it should repeatedly search and remove occurrences of "map" and "pie" until neither substring is present, and it should correctly count and return the total number of deletions required.

Given the described issues, the current implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
