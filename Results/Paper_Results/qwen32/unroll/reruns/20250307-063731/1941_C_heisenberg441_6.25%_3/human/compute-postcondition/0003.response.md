Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The string s is not equal to 'mapie'. `ans` is 0.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` has been set to 0, while all other conditions and values remain unchanged.
