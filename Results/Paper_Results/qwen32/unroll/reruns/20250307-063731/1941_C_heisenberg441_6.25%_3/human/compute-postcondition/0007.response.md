To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and understand its behavior step-by-step.

Given:
- Initial State: `s` is a string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, and `ans` is the count of how many times 'map' was found and removed.
- Code of the loop:
  ```python
  while s.find('pie') != -1:
      s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
      ans += 1
  ```

The loop will continue to execute as long as the substring 'pie' is found in the string `s`. In each iteration:
- It finds the first occurrence of 'pie' in `s`.
- It removes 'pie' by concatenating the substring before 'pie' and the substring after 'pie'.
- It increments the `ans` counter by 1.

Since the loop is specifically looking for 'pie' and removing it, the final state of `s` will be the original string with all occurrences of 'pie' removed. The `ans` variable will hold the count of how many times 'pie' was found and removed.

**Output State:**
- `s` will be the string with all occurrences of 'pie' removed.
- `ans` will be the count of how many times 'pie' was found and removed.

Output State: **s will be the string with all occurrences of 'pie' removed, and ans will be the count of how many times 'pie' was found and removed.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `s` will no longer contain the substring 'pie', and `ans` will tell us how many times 'pie' was present in the original string.
