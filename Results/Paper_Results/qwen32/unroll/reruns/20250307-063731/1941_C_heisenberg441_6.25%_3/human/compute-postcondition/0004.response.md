To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop: `s.find('map') != -1`. This condition checks if the substring 'map' is present in the string `s`. If it is, the loop will execute.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
- The string `s` is not equal to 'mapie'.
- `ans` is 0.

The only variable in the loop head is `s`, so we can only adjust that one. To ensure the loop executes, `s` must contain the substring 'map'.

### Example Answer:
The only variable in the loop head is `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain the substring 'map'. Given that `s` is not equal to 'mapie', we need to ensure `s` contains 'map' but does not necessarily have to be 'mapie'.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and contains the substring 'map', `ans` is 0**

This ensures that the condition `s.find('map') != -1` is true, and thus the loop can execute.
