Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. The function `func_1` removes occurrences of "map" and "pie" one at a time, but this approach does not necessarily yield the minimum number of deletions. For example, consider the test case "ppiee". The function would remove the "ie" from "pie" first, resulting in "ppee", and then it would not find any more "map" or "pie" substrings to remove, resulting in an output of 1. However, the correct answer is 0, as the string can be made beautiful by removing the "p" from "ppiee", resulting in "piee" and then removing "ie" from "piee", resulting in "pee" (or by other valid deletions).

The program needs to be rewritten to consider all possible deletions and find the optimal solution. One possible way to achieve this is by using dynamic programming or a greedy approach that considers overlapping substrings more effectively.
