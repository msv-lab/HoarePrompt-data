You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 1000000000 500000000 500000000 1000000000

Output

    1 2 1 
    7 2 2 7 
    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function generates all possible subarray sums of an array `a`.
   - It iterates through all possible starting and ending indices of subarrays and calculates their sums.
   - Finally, it sorts the list of subarray sums.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function takes a sorted list of subarray sums (`cts`) and returns a list of unique subarray sums, where each subarray sum appears only once.
   - It works by iterating through the sorted list and keeping track of the previous element. If the current element is the same as the previous one, it removes the previous one from the result list.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of unique subarray sums (`odds`).
   - It initializes an array `a` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It iterates through the unique subarray sums in reverse order and calculates the elements of the palindrome array `a` based on the differences between consecutive subarray sums.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the sorted list of all subarray sums (`bigList`) with the list of unique subarray sums (`smallList`).
   - It removes common elements from the end of both lists and returns the last element of the remaining `bigList`, which is the missing subarray sum.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly generates all subarray sums, but it is not used in the main logic to find the missing subarray sum.
   - Instead, the function `func_2` is used to find unique subarray sums, which is a different approach.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function correctly identifies unique subarray sums by removing duplicates.
   - However, it assumes that the input list `cts` is already sorted, which is not guaranteed unless explicitly sorted.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
   - It assumes that the unique subarray sums are in a specific order, which is not guaranteed unless explicitly sorted.
   - The logic for reconstructing the array seems correct, but it depends on the correct order of unique subarray sums.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function correctly finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the sorted list of all subarray sums with the list of unique subarray sums.
   - However, it assumes that the input list `bigList` is already sorted, which is not guaranteed unless explicitly sorted.

### Correctness

The program does not explicitly sort the list of all subarray sums (`bigList`) before using it in `func_4`. This could lead to incorrect results if the input list is not sorted.

### Example of Incorrectness

Consider the following test case:
```
3
1 2 3 4 1
```
The program might not correctly identify the missing subarray sum if the list of subarray sums is not sorted before processing.

### Conclusion

Since the program does not guarantee that the list of subarray sums is sorted before processing, it can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Correctness: **False**.
