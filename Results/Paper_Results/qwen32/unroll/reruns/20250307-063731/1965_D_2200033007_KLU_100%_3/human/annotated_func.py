    #The program returns the list `[3, 3, 10, 3, 3]` which is a palindrome.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `odds` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a palindrome list of size `n` constructed based on the values in the `odds` list.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers, `bigList` and `smallList`, and modifies `bigList` by removing elements from the end as long as the last elements of both lists are equal. It returns the last element of the modified `bigList`.
