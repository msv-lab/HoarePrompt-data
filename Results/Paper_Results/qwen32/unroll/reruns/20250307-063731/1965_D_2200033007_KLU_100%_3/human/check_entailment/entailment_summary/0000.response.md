### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a palindrome array `a` of size `n`.
   - We are provided with the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays.
   - Our task is to reconstruct the palindrome array `a`.

2. **Approach Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the list of subarray sums.
   - The list of subarray sums is sorted.
   - Function `func_2` removes consecutive duplicates from the sorted list of subarray sums.
   - The main logic decides whether to use `n + 2` or `n - 2` based on the length of the list of odd sums.
   - Function `func_3` constructs a palindrome array from the list of odd sums.
   - Function `func_4` helps in identifying the missing subarray sum by comparing the constructed sums with the given subarray sums.
   - The missing sum is then added to the list of odd sums, which is sorted again and passed to `func_3` to construct the final palindrome array.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function generates all possible subarray sums from a given list and returns them sorted. The description matches the behavior.
   - **`func_2`**: This function removes consecutive duplicates from a list. This is useful for identifying unique subarray sums.
   - **`func_3`**: This function constructs a palindrome array from a list of sums. The construction seems to be based on the differences between consecutive sums.
   - **`func_4`**: This function finds the last differing element between two lists, which helps in identifying the missing subarray sum.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the removal of duplicates and the construction of the palindrome array.
   - The logic for determining the missing subarray sum seems correct based on the comparison of sums.
   - The program ensures that the final array is a palindrome and matches the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs the palindrome array based on the provided subarray sums and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
