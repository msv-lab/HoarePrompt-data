### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and verify if it correctly solves the problem based on the provided explanations and example cases.

1. **Sorting Subarray Sums:**
   - The subarray sums are sorted at the beginning. This helps in identifying the missing subarray sum later.

2. **Filtering Odd Occurrences:**
   - `func_2` is called to remove consecutive duplicates from the sorted list of subarray sums. This step is crucial because the sums of subarrays that appear an even number of times (like subarrays that are symmetric in a palindrome) will cancel out, leaving only the sums that appear an odd number of times.

3. **Identifying the Missing Sum:**
   - If the length of the list `odds` (after removing consecutive duplicates) is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, it means there are more odd occurrences than expected, indicating the presence of an even-length subarray sum that is missing.
   - The code then separates these sums into `oddvals` and `evenvals`. It identifies the missing sum based on the first element of `evenvals` or `oddvals` if they exist.
   - If there are no `evenvals` or `oddvals`, it constructs a smaller palindrome `b` using `func_3` with size `n + 2`, calculates its subarray sums, and uses `func_4` to find the missing sum.
   - If the length of `odds` is not greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, it constructs a smaller palindrome `b` using `func_3` with size `n - 2`, calculates its subarray sums, and uses `func_4` to find the missing sum.

4. **Constructing the Palindrome:**
   - The missing sum is added back to the `odds` list, and the list is sorted again.
   - `func_3` is called again to construct the final palindrome array `a` of size `n` using the values in the `odds` list.

5. **Verification:**
   - The constructed palindrome `a` should satisfy the condition that its subarray sums match the given sums except for one missing sum.
   - The example cases provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the code, indicating that the logic is sound.

### Correctness:

Given the detailed analysis and the fact that the example cases are correctly handled, the code appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
