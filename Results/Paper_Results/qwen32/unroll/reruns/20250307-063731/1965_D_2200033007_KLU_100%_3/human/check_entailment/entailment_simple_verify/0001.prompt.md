You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the provided Python program and verify if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
1. **Input**: A series of test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` (size of the palindrome array) and a list of `n*(n+1)/2 - 1` integers (subarray sums, missing one).
2. **Output**: For each test case, output a palindrome array `a` of size `n` such that all but one of its subarray sums match the provided list.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of four functions:
1. **func_1(a)**: Generates all subarray sums of array `a` and returns them sorted.
2. **func_2(cts)**: Takes a list of subarray sums (`cts`) and returns a new list (`odds`) where each element appears an odd number of times. This is done by removing pairs of identical sums.
3. **func_3(odds, n)**: Constructs a palindrome array `a` of size `n` from the list `odds`. It starts from the middle of `a` and fills in the values such that `a[i] = a[n-1-i]`.
4. **func_4(bigList, smallList)**: Finds the missing subarray sum by comparing `bigList` (which contains all subarray sums of the palindrome array) with `smallList` (the input list of subarray sums). It removes matching sums from the end of both lists and returns the last remaining sum in `bigList`.

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **func_1(a)**: This function correctly generates all subarray sums and sorts them, which is necessary for the next steps.
2. **func_2(cts)**: This function correctly processes the list of subarray sums to remove pairs, leaving only sums that appear an odd number of times. Since the input guarantees that there is always a valid solution, this step should work correctly.
3. **func_3(odds, n)**: This function attempts to construct a palindrome array from the list `odds`. The logic seems correct in that it fills the array symmetrically from the center, ensuring that `a[i] = a[n-1-i]`. However, the assumption here is that the list `odds` contains the correct elements to form a valid palindrome array.
4. **func_4(bigList, smallList)**: This function correctly identifies the missing subarray sum by comparing the two lists. It removes matching sums from the end of both lists and returns the last remaining sum in `bigList`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. It generates all subarray sums, processes them to find the unique ones, constructs a palindrome array, and identifies the missing subarray sum. Given the constraints and guarantees in the problem, the program should work correctly.
