t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 200. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and s is a list of integers of length \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) where each integer s_i satisfies 1 ≤ s_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000. There is always at least one valid solution.
