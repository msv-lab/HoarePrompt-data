Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function generates all possible subarray sums of an array `a`.
   - It iterates through all possible starting and ending indices of subarrays and calculates their sums.
   - Finally, it sorts the list of subarray sums.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function takes a sorted list of subarray sums (`cts`) and returns a list of unique subarray sums, where each subarray sum appears only once.
   - It works by iterating through the sorted list and keeping track of the previous element. If the current element is the same as the previous one, it removes the previous one from the result list.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of unique subarray sums (`odds`).
   - It initializes an array `a` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It iterates through the unique subarray sums in reverse order and calculates the elements of the palindrome array `a` based on the differences between consecutive subarray sums.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the sorted list of all subarray sums (`bigList`) with the list of unique subarray sums (`smallList`).
   - It removes common elements from the end of both lists and returns the last element of the remaining `bigList`, which is the missing subarray sum.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly generates all subarray sums, but it is not used in the main logic to find the missing subarray sum.
   - Instead, the function `func_2` is used to find unique subarray sums, which is a different approach.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function correctly identifies unique subarray sums by removing duplicates.
   - However, it assumes that the input list `cts` is already sorted, which is not guaranteed unless explicitly sorted.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
   - It assumes that the unique subarray sums are in a specific order, which is not guaranteed unless explicitly sorted.
   - The logic for reconstructing the array seems correct, but it depends on the correct order of unique subarray sums.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function correctly finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the sorted list of all subarray sums with the list of unique subarray sums.
   - However, it assumes that the input list `bigList` is already sorted, which is not guaranteed unless explicitly sorted.

### Correctness

The program does not explicitly sort the list of all subarray sums (`bigList`) before using it in `func_4`. This could lead to incorrect results if the input list is not sorted.

### Example of Incorrectness

Consider the following test case:
```
3
1 2 3 4 1
```
The program might not correctly identify the missing subarray sum if the list of subarray sums is not sorted before processing.

### Conclusion

Since the program does not guarantee that the list of subarray sums is sorted before processing, it can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Correctness: **False**.
