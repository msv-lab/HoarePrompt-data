To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify whether the program correctly reconstructs any possible palindrome array `a` from the provided subarray sums. Let's analyze each function and the overall logic.

### Function Analysis

1. **`func_1(a)`**
   - Purpose: Generates all subarray sums of the array `a` and returns them sorted.
   - Correctness: This function is correct in generating and sorting all subarray sums. However, it is not used in the main logic provided in the problem to solve the problem.

2. **`func_2(cts)`**
   - Purpose: Takes a list of subarray sums and returns a list of sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - Correctness: This function is correct in filtering out sums that appear an even number of times, leaving only those that appear an odd number of times. This is because in a palindrome, every subarray sum except the missing one must appear an even number of times.

3. **`func_3(odds, n)`**
   - Purpose: Constructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - Correctness: This function attempts to reconstruct the palindrome by subtracting the previous sum from the current sum and dividing by 2, which is correct for constructing the elements of the palindrome. However, it assumes that the list `odds` is correctly ordered, which is ensured by `func_2`.

4. **`func_4(bigList, smallList)`**
   - Purpose: Finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the sorted list of all subarray sums and the list of sums that appear an odd number of times.
   - Correctness: This function is correct in identifying the missing sum by comparing the last elements of the sorted lists. However, it is not directly used in the given solution, and the missing sum is not necessary for constructing the palindrome array.

### Overall Logic

The main logic involves:
1. Generating all subarray sums (though not directly used in the solution).
2. Filtering out sums that appear an even number of times.
3. Using the remaining sums to construct the palindrome array.

The program correctly identifies the sums that appear an odd number of times and uses these to construct the palindrome array. The approach is sound and should work given the constraints.

### Conclusion

The program is correct in its approach to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
