Let's analyze the given loop and understand how it modifies `bigList` and `smallList`.

### Initial State:
- `bigList` is a list of integers.
- `smallList` is a list of integers, and it is expected to be shorter than or equal to `bigList`.
- The loop will remove elements from the end of `bigList` as long as the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`.

### Loop Execution:
- The loop condition checks if `smallList` is not empty and if the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`.
- If both conditions are true, the last element of both `bigList` and `smallList` is removed using the `pop()` method.
- This process continues until either `smallList` becomes empty or the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are not equal.

### Output State:
- After the loop, `bigList` will have had all matching trailing elements removed that were also present in `smallList`.
- The function returns the last element of the modified `bigList`.

### Example:
If `bigList` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `smallList` is `[4, 5]`, the loop will remove `5` and `4` from both lists, leaving `bigList` as `[1, 2, 3]`. The function will then return `3`.

### General Output State:
- The output state will be the modified `bigList` with trailing elements removed that matched `smallList`, and the function will return the last element of this modified `bigList`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **the last element of the modified bigList after all matching trailing elements with smallList are removed.**

In natural language:
The output state is the last element of `bigList` after all the trailing elements that matched `smallList` have been removed from `bigList`.
