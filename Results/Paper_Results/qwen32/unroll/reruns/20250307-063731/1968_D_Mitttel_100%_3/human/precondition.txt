a is a list of n integers (1 \le a_i \le 10^9), p is a list of n integers representing a permutation (1 \le p_i \le n), s is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) where 1 \le P_B, P_S \le n, and k is an integer (1 \le k \le 10^9) representing the number of turns. n is the length of the permutation and array a, with the constraint that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
