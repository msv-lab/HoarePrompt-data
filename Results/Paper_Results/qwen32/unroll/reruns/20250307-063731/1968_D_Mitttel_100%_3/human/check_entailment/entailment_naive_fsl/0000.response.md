Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the calculation of `mx` and `cur` does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. The program calculates `mx` as `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`, which incorrectly assumes that the player can stay in the current position and accumulate the score `k * a[s]` for the remaining turns. However, the problem states that the player can either stay in the current position or move to `p[s]` on each turn, and the score is accumulated based on the positions they visit.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2 1 2
3 1 2
7 2 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bodya
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- Bodya starts at position 1, with `a[1] = 7`.
  - Turn 1: Bodya stays at position 1, score = 7.
  - Turn 2: Bodya moves to position 3 (`p[1] = 3`), score = 7 + 5 = 12.
- Sasha starts at position 2, with `a[2] = 2`.
  - Turn 1: Sasha moves to position 1 (`p[2] = 1`), score = 2 + 7 = 9.
  - Turn 2: Sasha stays at position 1, score = 9 + 7 = 16.

Thus, Sasha wins with a score of 16 compared to Bodya's score of 12.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program would incorrectly calculate the maximum score for Bodya and Sasha, potentially leading to an incorrect winner determination.

**Correct Approach:**
The correct approach should involve simulating the game for both players for `k` turns, accumulating the scores based on the positions they visit, and then comparing the final scores.

In summary, the program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement, and thus it is incorrect.
