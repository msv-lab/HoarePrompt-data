### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program, especially the `func_1` function, which is responsible for calculating the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Each player starts at a given position.
   - On each turn, a player can either stay at the current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation.
   - The score increases by the value at the current position.
   - The game lasts for `k` turns.
   - The winner is the player with the higher score after `k` turns.

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - Simulate the game for both players for `k` turns.
   - At each turn, calculate the score based on whether the player stays or moves.
   - Track the visited positions to avoid infinite loops in cycles.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the score array `a`.
   - Adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` to be 0-based (since Python uses 0-based indexing).

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - Calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha's starting positions.
   - The `func_1` function calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Initializes `mx` (maximum score) and `cur` (current score) to 0.
   - Uses a `vis` array to track visited positions to avoid cycles.
   - For each turn, updates the score and either stays or moves based on the permutation.
   - The key calculation is `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`, which seems incorrect because it assumes the player can stay at the current position and accumulate the score `k * a[s]` for the remaining turns. This is not the intended behavior as per the problem statement.

#### Counterexample Analysis:
The original assessment provides a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2 1 2
3 1 2
7 2 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bodya
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- Bodya starts at position 1, with `a[1] = 7`.
  - Turn 1: Bodya stays at position 1, score = 7.
  - Turn 2: Bodya moves to position 3 (`p[1] = 3`), score = 7 + 5 = 12.
- Sasha starts at position 2, with `a[2] = 2`.
  - Turn 1: Sasha moves to position 1 (`p[2] = 1`), score = 2 + 7 = 9.
  - Turn 2: Sasha stays at position 1, score = 9 + 7 = 16.

Thus, Sasha wins with a score of 16 compared to Bodya's score of 12.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program would incorrectly calculate the maximum score for Bodya and Sasha, potentially leading to an incorrect winner determination.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. The key issue is in the `func_1` function, where the calculation `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` is incorrect because it assumes the player can stay at the current position and accumulate the score `k * a[s]` for the remaining turns.

**Final: False**
