You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1
        a[i] -= 1
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    return mx



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of integers, a permutation list `p`, a list `s` containing test case parameters, and an integer `k`. It returns the maximum value `mx` calculated based on the values in `a`, the permutation in `p`, the starting position indicated by `s`, and the decrementing value `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's go through the provided Python program and the problem description step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in a permutation and move according to the rules described. The goal is to determine the winner after `k` turns, based on the scores accumulated by each player.

### Key Points

1. **Permutation and Array**: The players move through a permutation `p` and collect scores from an array `a`.
2. **Movement Rules**: Each player can either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation.
3. **Score Calculation**: The score is incremented by the value in the array `a` at the current position.
4. **Objective**: The player with the higher score after `k` turns wins. If the scores are equal, it's a draw.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases, each with different values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a`. It then calculates the maximum score each player can achieve after `k` turns and determines the winner.

#### Key Components of the Program

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
2. **Index Adjustment**: The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 to match Python's 0-based indexing.
3. **Score Calculation**: The function `func_1` is used to calculate the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` and making up to `k` moves.
4. **Comparison**: The scores of Bodya and Sasha are compared to determine the winner.

#### Function `func_1`

- **Parameters**: `a` (array of scores), `p` (permutation), `s` (starting position), `k` (number of turns).
- **Logic**: 
  - Uses a `vis` array to track visited positions to avoid infinite loops.
  - Iterates up to `k` times, updating the current position `s` and the score `cur`.
  - Keeps track of the maximum possible score `mx` that can be achieved by staying at the current position for the remaining turns.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Index Adjustment**: The program subtracts 1 from all elements of `a` and `p`, which is incorrect. The values in `a` should remain unchanged, and the indices in `p` should be adjusted to 0-based indexing.
2. **Score Calculation**: The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum score, but the logic of adding `k * a[s]` is incorrect. It should consider the actual path taken and the scores collected at each step.

### Corrected Program

To fix the program, we need to adjust the index handling and the score calculation logic.

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1  # Adjust permutation to 0-based indexing
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    mx = cur
    if k > 0:
        cycle_length = 0
        cycle_score = 0
        s = p[s]
        while not vis[s]:
            vis[s] = 1
            cycle_length += 1
            cycle_score += a[s]
            s = p[s]
        full_cycles = k // cycle_length
        remaining_turns = k % cycle_length
        mx += full_cycles * cycle_score
        for _ in range(remaining_turns):
            mx += a[s]
            s = p[s]
    return mx
```

### Conclusion

The original program had issues with index adjustment and score calculation logic. After correcting these issues, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect and needs adjustments as explained above.)
