You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, p is a list of n integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n, s is a list of 4 integers where s[0] is the number of test cases t, s[1] is the length of the permutation n, s[2] is Bodya's starting position P_B, s[3] is Sasha's starting position P_S, n is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: mx, cur, k, vis, s.
    return mx
    #The program returns the value of `mx`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a list `p` of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, a list `s` of 4 integers where `s[0]` is the number of test cases `t`, `s[1]` is the length of the permutation `n`, `s[2]` is Bodya's starting position `P_B`, and `s[3]` is Sasha's starting position `P_S`, and a non-negative integer `k` between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function returns the value of `mx`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `mx`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
