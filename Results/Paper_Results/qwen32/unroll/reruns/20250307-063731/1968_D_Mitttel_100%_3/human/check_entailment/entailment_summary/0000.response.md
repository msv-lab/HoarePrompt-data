### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the "Permutation game" problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the correctness of the program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`, which represent the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 from each element. This is because Python uses 0-based indexing, while the problem description uses 1-based indexing.

3. **Calculating Scores:**
   - The program calculates the maximum score for Bodya and Sasha using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function calculates the score for a given player by simulating the game:
     - It initializes `mx` to 0, `cur` to 0, and a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions.
     - It iterates while the current position has not been visited and `k` (number of turns) is greater than 0.
     - In each iteration, it marks the current position as visited, updates `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`, adds `a[s]` to `cur`, decrements `k` by 1, and moves to the next position `p[s]`.

4. **Determining the Winner:**
   - After calculating the scores for both players, it compares them and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Index Adjustment:**
  - The program incorrectly adjusts the indices of `a` by subtracting 1. The array `a` should not be adjusted since the values in `a` are not indices but scores. This adjustment will lead to incorrect results.
  - The permutation `p` should be adjusted correctly by subtracting 1 from each element to convert from 1-based to 0-based indexing.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1  # Adjusting indices for permutation p to 0-based
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)  # No adjustment needed for a
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    return mx
```

### Conclusion:
The original program contains an error in adjusting the indices of the array `a`. After correcting this issue, the program should work as intended.

**Correctness: False** (due to the incorrect adjustment of the `a` array indices)  
**Corrected Correctness: True** (after fixing the index adjustment issue)
