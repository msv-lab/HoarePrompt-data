To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's break down the loop's behavior and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a`: A list of `n` integers.
   - `p`: A permutation list of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `s`: A list of 4 integers `[t, n, P_B, P_S]`.
   - `k`: A non-negative integer.
   - `mx`: Initialized to 0.
   - `cur`: Initialized to 0.
   - `vis`: A list of `n` zeros indicating which positions have been visited.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as the current position `s` has not been visited (`not vis[s]`) and `k` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - Mark the current position `s` as visited by setting `vis[s] = 1`.
     - Update `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`.
     - Add the value of `a[s]` to `cur`.
     - Decrement `k` by 1.
     - Update `s` to the next position in the permutation, i.e., `s = p[s]`.

3. **Termination:**
   - The loop terminates when `s` has been visited before (`vis[s] == 1`) or `k` reaches 0.

4. **Output State:**
   - After the loop finishes, `mx` will hold the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop.
   - `cur` will be the sum of the values of `a[s]` for all visited positions.
   - `k` will be the remaining number of iterations after the loop terminates.
   - `vis` will reflect which positions have been visited.
   - `s` will be the last position visited before the loop terminates.

Since the loop modifies `mx`, `cur`, `k`, `vis`, and `s`, these are the variables we need to focus on for the output state.

**Output State: **mx, cur, k, vis, s.**

**Natural Language Explanation:**
- `mx` will contain the highest value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the traversal.
- `cur` will be the sum of the values from the list `a` at each visited position.
- `k` will indicate how many more iterations could have been performed if the loop hadn't terminated.
- `vis` will be a list where each index corresponds to a position in the permutation, and the value at each index will be 1 if that position was visited, otherwise 0.
- `s` will be the last position in the permutation that was visited before the loop stopped.
