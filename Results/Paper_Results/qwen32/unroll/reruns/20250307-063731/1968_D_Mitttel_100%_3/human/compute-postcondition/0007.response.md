Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a list `p` of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, a list `s` of 4 integers where `s[0]` is the number of test cases `t`, `s[1]` is the length of the permutation `n`, `s[2]` is Bodya's starting position `P_B`, and `s[3]` is Sasha's starting position `P_S`, and a non-negative integer `k` between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function returns the value of `mx`.**
