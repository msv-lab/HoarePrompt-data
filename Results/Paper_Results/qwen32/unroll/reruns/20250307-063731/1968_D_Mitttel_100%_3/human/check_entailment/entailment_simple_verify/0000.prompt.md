You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

    Sasha
    Sasha
    Bodya
    
Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the calculation of `mx` and `cur` does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. The program calculates `mx` as `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`, which incorrectly assumes that the player can stay in the current position and accumulate the score `k * a[s]` for the remaining turns. However, the problem states that the player can either stay in the current position or move to `p[s]` on each turn, and the score is accumulated based on the positions they visit.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2 1 2
3 1 2
7 2 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bodya
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- Bodya starts at position 1, with `a[1] = 7`.
  - Turn 1: Bodya stays at position 1, score = 7.
  - Turn 2: Bodya moves to position 3 (`p[1] = 3`), score = 7 + 5 = 12.
- Sasha starts at position 2, with `a[2] = 2`.
  - Turn 1: Sasha moves to position 1 (`p[2] = 1`), score = 2 + 7 = 9.
  - Turn 2: Sasha stays at position 1, score = 9 + 7 = 16.

Thus, Sasha wins with a score of 16 compared to Bodya's score of 12.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program would incorrectly calculate the maximum score for Bodya and Sasha, potentially leading to an incorrect winner determination.

**Correct Approach:**
The correct approach should involve simulating the game for both players for `k` turns, accumulating the scores based on the positions they visit, and then comparing the final scores.

In summary, the program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement, and thus it is incorrect.
