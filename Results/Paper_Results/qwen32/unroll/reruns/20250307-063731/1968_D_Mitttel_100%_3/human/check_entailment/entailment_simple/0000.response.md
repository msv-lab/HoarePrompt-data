### Reasoning:

The given problem involves simulating a game where two players, Bodya and Sasha, start at different positions in a permutation and move according to the rules specified. The goal is to determine who has the higher score after a given number of turns, `k`.

The program provided reads multiple test cases and processes each one by:
1. Reading the input values for `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
2. Adjusting the permutation and array indices to be 0-based.
3. Calling `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha to calculate their respective scores after `k` turns.
4. Comparing the scores and printing the result.

The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the maximum possible score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` in the permutation and playing for `k` turns. Here's how it works:
1. It initializes `mx` (maximum score), `cur` (current score), and a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions.
2. It iterates through the permutation while `k` turns are left and the current position `s` has not been visited.
3. In each iteration, it updates `mx` with the maximum score possible if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns.
4. It adds the score of the current position to `cur`.
5. It decrements `k` and moves to the next position in the permutation.

The logic within `func_1` ensures that the player maximizes their score by considering the option of staying at the current position for all remaining turns. This is a reasonable strategy because the score at each position is added to the total, and staying at a position with a high score for multiple turns can potentially lead to a higher total score.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, it appears that the program correctly simulates the game and determines the winner based on the scores.
