The code snippet initializes a list `vis` with `n` zeros. This means that `vis` is now a list of length `n` where each element is `0`.

The initial state of the variables `a`, `p`, `s`, `n`, `k`, `mx`, and `cur` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `s` is a list of 4 integers where `s[0]` is the number of test cases `t`, `s[1]` is the length of the permutation `n`, `s[2]` is Bodya's starting position `P_B`, `s[3]` is Sasha's starting position `P_S`, `n` is the length of the list `p`, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.**
