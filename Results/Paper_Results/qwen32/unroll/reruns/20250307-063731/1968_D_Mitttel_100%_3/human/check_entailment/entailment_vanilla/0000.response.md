Let's go through the provided Python program and the problem description step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in a permutation and move according to the rules described. The goal is to determine the winner after `k` turns, based on the scores accumulated by each player.

### Key Points

1. **Permutation and Array**: The players move through a permutation `p` and collect scores from an array `a`.
2. **Movement Rules**: Each player can either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation.
3. **Score Calculation**: The score is incremented by the value in the array `a` at the current position.
4. **Objective**: The player with the higher score after `k` turns wins. If the scores are equal, it's a draw.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases, each with different values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a`. It then calculates the maximum score each player can achieve after `k` turns and determines the winner.

#### Key Components of the Program

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
2. **Index Adjustment**: The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 to match Python's 0-based indexing.
3. **Score Calculation**: The function `func_1` is used to calculate the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` and making up to `k` moves.
4. **Comparison**: The scores of Bodya and Sasha are compared to determine the winner.

#### Function `func_1`

- **Parameters**: `a` (array of scores), `p` (permutation), `s` (starting position), `k` (number of turns).
- **Logic**: 
  - Uses a `vis` array to track visited positions to avoid infinite loops.
  - Iterates up to `k` times, updating the current position `s` and the score `cur`.
  - Keeps track of the maximum possible score `mx` that can be achieved by staying at the current position for the remaining turns.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Index Adjustment**: The program subtracts 1 from all elements of `a` and `p`, which is incorrect. The values in `a` should remain unchanged, and the indices in `p` should be adjusted to 0-based indexing.
2. **Score Calculation**: The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum score, but the logic of adding `k * a[s]` is incorrect. It should consider the actual path taken and the scores collected at each step.

### Corrected Program

To fix the program, we need to adjust the index handling and the score calculation logic.

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1  # Adjust permutation to 0-based indexing
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    mx = cur
    if k > 0:
        cycle_length = 0
        cycle_score = 0
        s = p[s]
        while not vis[s]:
            vis[s] = 1
            cycle_length += 1
            cycle_score += a[s]
            s = p[s]
        full_cycles = k // cycle_length
        remaining_turns = k % cycle_length
        mx += full_cycles * cycle_score
        for _ in range(remaining_turns):
            mx += a[s]
            s = p[s]
    return mx
```

### Conclusion

The original program had issues with index adjustment and score calculation logic. After correcting these issues, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect and needs adjustments as explained above.)
