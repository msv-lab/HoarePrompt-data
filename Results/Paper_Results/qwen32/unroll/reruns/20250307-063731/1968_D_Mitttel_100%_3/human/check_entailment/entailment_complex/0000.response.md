### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the winner of a game played by Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions in a permutation and the values assigned to those positions. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` which represent the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - The program adjusts the indices in `p` and `a` to be zero-based, which is a common practice in programming to make indexing easier.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` and playing for `k` turns.
   - Inside `func_1`, it follows the permutation `p` starting from `s`, and at each step, it adds the value from `a` at the current position to the current score `cur`.
   - It also keeps track of the maximum score `mx` that can be achieved if the player stays at the current position for the remaining `k` turns.
   - The function returns the maximum score `mx`.

4. **Comparison of Scores:**
   - The program calculates the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha using `func_1`.
   - It then compares these scores and prints the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Analysis of `func_1`:

The function `func_1` is crucial for the correctness of the program. It calculates the maximum score by considering the following:
- The player can stay at the current position for the remaining turns or move to the next position in the permutation.
- The maximum score `mx` is updated at each step to account for the best possible score achievable by staying at the current position for the remaining turns.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It follows the permutation, calculates the scores, and compares them to determine the winner. The preprocessing step to adjust indices to zero-based is also correct. The use of `func_1` ensures that the maximum score is calculated efficiently.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
