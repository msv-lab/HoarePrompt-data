The code snippet `n = len(p)` assigns the length of the list `p` to the variable `n`. Since `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, the length of `p` is indeed `n`. Therefore, the value of `n` is now explicitly set to the length of the list `p`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `s` is a list of 4 integers where `s[0]` is the number of test cases `t`, `s[1]` is the length of the permutation `n`, `s[2]` is Bodya's starting position `P_B`, `s[3]` is Sasha's starting position `P_S`, `n` is the length of the list `p`, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and the sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
