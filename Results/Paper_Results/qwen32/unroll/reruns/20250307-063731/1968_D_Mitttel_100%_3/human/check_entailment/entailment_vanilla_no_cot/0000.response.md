Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Index Adjustment**: The program adjusts the indices of the `p` and `a` arrays by subtracting 1. However, the `func_1` function uses these adjusted indices, but the function itself does not account for this adjustment correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to work with the original 1-based indexing of the problem statement, but it receives the adjusted 0-based indices. This can lead to incorrect calculations.

2. **Score Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score by considering the score accumulated in a loop until a cycle is detected or `k` turns are completed. However, the calculation of `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` is incorrect. The player does not get to add `a[s]` to the score `k` times after reaching a cycle. Instead, the player should add `a[s]` for each turn until `k` turns are completed or the player exits the cycle.

3. **Cycle Detection and Handling**: The function `func_1` does not handle cycles correctly. When a cycle is detected, the function should compute the score for the remaining turns after completing full cycles and then add the score for the partial cycle if necessary.

4. **Base Indexing**: The function `func_1` is called with `pb - 1` and `ps - 1`, which are 0-based indices, but the function does not handle these indices correctly as described above.

To fix these issues, the function `func_1` should be revised to correctly handle the scoring logic, cycle detection, and the conversion between 1-based and 0-based indexing.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    vis = [0] * n
    steps = [0] * n
    cycle_start = -1
    cur_score = 0

    # Detect cycle and calculate scores until a cycle is found or k turns are completed
    for step in range(k):
        if vis[s]:
            cycle_start = s
            break
        vis[s] = 1
        steps[s] = step
        cur_score += a[s]
        s = p[s]

    if cycle_start == -1:
        # No cycle detected, return the score accumulated in k steps
        return cur_score

    # Cycle detected, calculate the score for the cycle
    cycle_length = step - steps[cycle_start]
    remaining_steps = k - steps[cycle_start]
    full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
    partial_cycle_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length

    # Calculate the score for the full cycles
    cycle_score = 0
    cycle_pos = cycle_start
    for _ in range(cycle_length):
        cycle_score += a[cycle_pos]
        cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos]

    # Calculate the score for the partial cycle
    partial_cycle_score = 0
    for _ in range(partial_cycle_steps):
        partial_cycle_score += a[s]
        s = p[s]

    # Total score is the score before the cycle plus the score for full cycles and the partial cycle
    return cur_score + full_cycles * cycle_score + partial_cycle_score
```

This corrected function properly handles the cycle detection and scoring logic, ensuring that the scores are calculated correctly for both players.
