To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the condition in the `while` loop: `while not vis[s] and k > 0:`.

Here, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, and `s` is a list of 4 integers where `s[2]` is Bodya's starting position `P_B`. The condition `not vis[s]` means that the element at the index `s` in the `vis` list should be `False` (or `0` in this context, since `vis` is initialized as a list of zeros). Additionally, `k > 0` means that `k` should be greater than 0.

Let's break it down:

1. **`vis[s]` condition**: 
   - `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, so initially, `vis[i]` is `0` for all `i`.
   - `s` is a list of 4 integers, and `s[2]` is Bodya's starting position `P_B`. Since `vis` is initialized with zeros, `vis[s[2]]` is initially `0`, which means `not vis[s[2]]` is `True`.

2. **`k > 0` condition**:
   - `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. To satisfy `k > 0`, `k` must be at least 1.

Since `vis[s[2]]` is initially `0` and `k` can be set to any value between 1 and 10^9, the loop can execute if we ensure that `k` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` to ensure it is greater than 0. The other states (`a`, `p`, `s`, `n`, `mx`, `cur`, and `vis`) do not need to be adjusted because they do not affect the condition in the `while` loop.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `s` is a list of 4 integers where `s[0]` is the number of test cases `t`, `s[1]` is the length of the permutation `n`, `s[2]` is Bodya's starting position `P_B`, `s[3]` is Sasha's starting position `P_S`, `n` is the length of the list `p`, `k` is greater than 0, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros**.
