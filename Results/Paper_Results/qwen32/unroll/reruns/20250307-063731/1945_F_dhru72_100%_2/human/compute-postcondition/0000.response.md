The provided code snippet only defines a `TypeVar` named `T`. This does not affect the initial state of the variables `t`, `n`, `v`, or `p`. It simply introduces a type variable that could be used in type annotations elsewhere in the code, but it does not change the values of any existing variables or introduce any new variables that affect the state.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; v is a list of integers of length n where each element v_i satisfies 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9; p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n; the sum of all n values over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.**
