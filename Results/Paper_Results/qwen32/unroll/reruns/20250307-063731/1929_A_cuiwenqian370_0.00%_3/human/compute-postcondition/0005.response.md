The provided loop takes a sorted list `arr` and rearranges its elements into a new list `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. Here's how the loop works:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `left` starts at the beginning of the list (`left = 0`).
   - `right` starts at the end of the list (`right = n - 1`).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - While `left` is less than or equal to `right`, the loop continues.
   - If `left` equals `right`, it means there's only one element left, which is added to `new_arr`.
   - Otherwise, the element at `right` (the largest remaining element) is added to `new_arr`, followed by the element at `left` (the smallest remaining element).
   - After each iteration, `left` is incremented and `right` is decremented.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `left` exceeds `right`, meaning all elements have been processed.

**Output State**:
- The `new_arr` list will contain elements from `arr` in the order of largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, and so on.
- `left` will be `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2` if `n` is even.
- `right` will be `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even (essentially, `left` and `right` will have crossed each other).

**Output State: **`new_arr` is a rearranged list of `arr` with elements ordered as largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, etc.; `left` is `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2` if `n` is even; `right` is `n // 2 - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `new_arr` contains the elements of `arr` rearranged such that they alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements, and `left` and `right` have crossed each other, indicating that the loop has completed.
