The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` of length `n`. It rearranges the list such that the elements are ordered as largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, and so on. The function then calculates and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in this rearranged list, which is referred to as `max_beauty`.
