The code snippet initializes a new empty list named `new_arr`. The values of `n` and `arr` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of integers of length n where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `new_arr` is an empty list.**
