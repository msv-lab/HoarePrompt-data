To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic used to calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.

The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
3. It calls the `func_1` function to compute the maximum beauty.
4. The `func_1` function sorts the array and then rearranges it by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements.
5. It calculates the beauty of the rearranged array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Let's analyze whether this approach yields the maximum beauty:

1. **Sorting the Array:** Sorting the array is a good first step because it allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Alternating Largest and Smallest Elements:** By alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements, the function creates a sequence that maximizes the differences between consecutive elements. This is because the difference between the largest and smallest element is always maximized in this arrangement.
3. **Calculating the Beauty:** The beauty is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array. This step is straightforward and correct.

The approach used in the program is optimal for maximizing the beauty of the array. It ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized by leveraging the sorted order of the array and alternating between the largest and smallest elements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
