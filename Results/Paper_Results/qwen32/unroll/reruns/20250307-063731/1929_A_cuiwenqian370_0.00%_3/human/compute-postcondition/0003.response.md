Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of integers of length n where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0, `right` is n - 1.**

Explanation: The value of `right` has been set to `n - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
