You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` of length `n`. It rearranges the list such that the elements are ordered as largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, and so on. The function then calculates and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in this rearranged list, which is referred to as `max_beauty`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic used to calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.

The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
3. It calls the `func_1` function to compute the maximum beauty.
4. The `func_1` function sorts the array and then rearranges it by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements.
5. It calculates the beauty of the rearranged array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Let's analyze whether this approach yields the maximum beauty:

1. **Sorting the Array:** Sorting the array is a good first step because it allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Alternating Largest and Smallest Elements:** By alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements, the function creates a sequence that maximizes the differences between consecutive elements. This is because the difference between the largest and smallest element is always maximized in this arrangement.
3. **Calculating the Beauty:** The beauty is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array. This step is straightforward and correct.

The approach used in the program is optimal for maximizing the beauty of the array. It ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized by leveraging the sorted order of the array and alternating between the largest and smallest elements.

Therefore, the program is correct.
