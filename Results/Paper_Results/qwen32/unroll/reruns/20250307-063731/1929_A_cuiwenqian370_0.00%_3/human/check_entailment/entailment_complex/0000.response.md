### Reasoning:

The task is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after potentially rearranging the array.

The provided program sorts the array and then rearranges it in a specific order: largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, and so on. This rearrangement is intended to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Let's analyze why this works:

1. **Sorting the Array:** Sorting the array allows easy access to the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Rearranging the Array:** By placing the largest and smallest elements alternately, the absolute differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This is because the difference between the largest and smallest elements is always the largest possible difference in the array.
3. **Calculating Beauty:** The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

Let's validate this with the given examples:

- **First Test Case:**
  - Input: `2, 1, 3`
  - Sorted: `1, 2, 3`
  - Rearranged: `3, 1, 2`
  - Beauty: `(3-1) + (2-1) = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - However, the optimal rearrangement is `1, 2, 3` or `3, 2, 1` both giving a beauty of `(2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2`.

- **Second Test Case:**
  - Input: `69, 69, 69`
  - Sorted: `69, 69, 69`
  - Rearranged: `69, 69, 69`
  - Beauty: `(69-69) + (69-69) = 0 + 0 = 0`

- **Third Test Case:**
  - Input: `100, 54, 80, 43, 90`
  - Sorted: `43, 54, 80, 90, 100`
  - Rearranged: `100, 43, 90, 54, 80`
  - Beauty: `(100-43) + (90-54) + (80-43) = 57 + 36 + 37 = 130`
  - However, the optimal rearrangement is `43, 80, 54, 90, 100` giving a beauty of `(80-43) + (90-54) + (100-90) = 37 + 36 + 10 = 83`
  - The optimal rearrangement is `43, 100, 54, 90, 80` giving a beauty of `(100-43) + (90-54) + (80-90) = 57 + 36 - 10 = 83`
