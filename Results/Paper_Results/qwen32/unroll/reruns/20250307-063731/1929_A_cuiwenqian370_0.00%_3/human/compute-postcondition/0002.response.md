Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of integers of length n where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0.**

In simple terms: The initial conditions for `n`, `arr`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged, and a new variable `left` is introduced with a value of 0.
