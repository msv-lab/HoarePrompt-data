Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a list of integers of length n where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.**

Natural Language: The list `arr` has been sorted in non-decreasing order, while `n` remains an integer between 2 and 100, inclusive, and each element in `arr` remains an integer between 1 and 10^9, inclusive.
