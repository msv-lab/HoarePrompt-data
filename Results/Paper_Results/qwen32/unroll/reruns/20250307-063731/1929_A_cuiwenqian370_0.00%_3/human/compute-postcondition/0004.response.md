To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `left <= right` is satisfied. 

Here's the given state right before the `while` loop:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
- `arr` is a list of integers of length `n` where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `new_arr` is an empty list.
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is `n - 1`.

The loop condition is `left <= right`. Given that `left` is initialized to 0 and `right` is initialized to `n - 1`, we need to ensure that `0 <= n - 1`. Since `n` is at least 2, `n - 1` is at least 1, and thus `0 <= n - 1` is always true.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of integers of length n where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0, `right` is n - 1**
