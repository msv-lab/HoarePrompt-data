In the given for loop, the loop head only involves the variable `i` and the range `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

Given the state before the loop starts, the variables `new_arr`, `left`, `right`, and `max_beauty` are not directly related to the execution of the for loop. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will be initialized to 1 as per the loop definition.

State: **`new_arr` is a rearranged list of `arr` with elements ordered as largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, etc.; `left` is `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2` if `n` is even; `right` is `n // 2 - 1`; `max_beauty` is 0; `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 1**
