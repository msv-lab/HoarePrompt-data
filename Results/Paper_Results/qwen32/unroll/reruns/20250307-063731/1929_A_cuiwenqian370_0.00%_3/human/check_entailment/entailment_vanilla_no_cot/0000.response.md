Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array in ascending order.
2. **Rearranging the Elements**: It then rearranges the elements in a specific pattern to maximize the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is done by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements.
3. **Calculating the Beauty**: Finally, it calculates the beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the highest possible beauty value. The example test cases also align with the expected output, confirming the correctness of the program.
