To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the loop and its impact on the variables.

The loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
```
This loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) and for each iteration, it calculates the absolute difference between the current element and the previous element in `new_arr` and adds this difference to `max_beauty`.

Given that `new_arr` is arranged such that it starts with the largest element, followed by the smallest, then the second largest, second smallest, and so on, the absolute differences between consecutive elements will be the sums of the differences between the largest and smallest, second largest and second smallest, and so forth.

The variables `left` and `right` are not modified within the loop, and `max_beauty` is the only variable that changes. It accumulates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

Let's denote the final value of `max_beauty` after the loop as `max_beauty_final`.

Output State: **`new_arr` is a rearranged list of `arr` with elements ordered as largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, etc.; `left` is `n // 2 + 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2` if `n` is even; `right` is `n // 2 - 1`; `max_beauty` is `max_beauty_final`.**
