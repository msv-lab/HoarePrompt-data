Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, program code, and annotated version.

### Analysis

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The program sorts the array to easily access the smallest and largest elements.
   - This step is correct as it allows for an easy rearrangement strategy.

2. **Alternating Largest and Smallest Elements:**
   - The program rearranges the sorted array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements.
   - This strategy aims to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Calculating the Beauty:**
   - The beauty is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.
   - This step is correct as it directly computes the beauty as defined in the problem.

### Evaluation Using Annotations

- **State of the Program Before Function Call:**
  - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
  - `arr` is a list of integers of length `n` where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

- **Inside `func_1`:**
  - The array is sorted.
  - `new_arr` is constructed by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements.
  - `max_beauty` is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

### Verification of the Strategy

The strategy of alternating between the largest and smallest elements is intended to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. Let's verify this:

- **Case 1: Distinct Elements**
  - If the elements are distinct, alternating between the largest and smallest will indeed maximize the differences.
  - Example: For the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the rearranged array `[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]` results in differences `[4, 3, 2, 1]` which sum to `10`.

- **Case 2: Identical Elements**
  - If all elements are identical, the beauty will be `0` regardless of the arrangement.
  - Example: For the array `[69, 69, 69]`, any arrangement will result in differences `[0, 0]` which sum to `0`.

- **Case 3: Mixed Elements**
  - For arrays with mixed elements, the alternating strategy still maximizes the differences by leveraging the sorted order.
  - Example: For the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, the rearranged array `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]` results in differences `[57, 47, 36, 26]` which sum to `166`.

### Conclusion

The program's strategy of sorting the array and then rearranging it by alternating between the largest and smallest elements effectively maximizes the beauty of the array. The annotations confirm that the program correctly implements this strategy and calculates the beauty accurately.

### Final Evaluation

**Reasoning:** The program correctly sorts the array, rearranges it by alternating between the largest and smallest elements, and calculates the beauty as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array. This approach is optimal for maximizing the beauty of the array.

**Final:** **True**
