t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple containing three elements: n (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5), a (a list of n integers such that 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9), and queries (a list of m tuples, where m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and each tuple (x_i, y_i) contains integers such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
