### Reasoning:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by precomputing the minimum cost to travel from each city to the next and from each city to the previous one. However, there are several issues with the approach:

1. **Initialization of `a`:** The code initializes `a` with sentinel values `-1000000000.0` and `2000000000.0` to handle edge cases, but these values are not necessary and can lead to incorrect calculations.

2. **Calculation of `b`:** The list `b` is supposed to store the cumulative costs, but the way it is computed is incorrect. The expression `b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)` does not correctly calculate the cumulative costs. The use of the exponentiation operator `**` with a boolean condition is not appropriate for this context.

3. **Query Handling:** When handling queries, the code attempts to access elements in `b` using indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` for forward travel and `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` for backward travel. However, the structure of `b` is not correctly set up to support these queries.

4. **Output:** The code prints the list `b` for debugging purposes, which is not part of the required output.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the provided code is not correct. It does not correctly compute the cumulative costs or handle the queries as intended.

**Correctness: False**
