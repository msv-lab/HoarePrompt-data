The `while` loop in the provided code snippet is `while t:`. This loop will execute as long as `t` is a non-zero integer. Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it is guaranteed that `t` is non-zero and the loop can certainly execute at least once.

Since `t` is guaranteed to be non-zero within the specified range, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute the first time. Therefore, the state remains the same as it was right before the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5, and for each of the `m` queries, there are two integers `x_i` and `y_i` such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; For every city, the closest city is determined uniquely; `r` is a lambda function that reads and maps a line of input to integers.**
