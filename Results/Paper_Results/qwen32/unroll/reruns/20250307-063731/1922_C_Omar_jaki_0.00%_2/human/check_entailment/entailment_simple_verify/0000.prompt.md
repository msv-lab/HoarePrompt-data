You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities based on the problem description. The code seems to be attempting to calculate some cumulative distances and then use them to determine the cost of travel, but it does not correctly handle the logic of moving to the closest city for 1 coin or directly traveling to another city for the distance cost.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**:
   - The code does not explicitly calculate the closest cities for each city. It seems to be trying to do something with cumulative distances, but this approach is not aligned with the problem's requirement to move to the closest city for 1 coin.

2. **Incorrect Use of Cumulative Distances**:
   - The code calculates some cumulative distances in the list `b`, but these distances are not used in a way that aligns with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the code does not correctly determine the cost of moving from one city to another using the closest city strategy.

3. **Incorrect Query Handling**:
   - The code attempts to handle queries by using the precomputed cumulative distances, but this approach does not correctly account for the fact that you can move to the closest city for 1 coin. The code simply subtracts cumulative distances, which does not reflect the problem's logic.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to:
- Determine the closest city for each city.
- For each query, use a strategy that allows moving to the closest city for 1 coin or directly traveling to the destination city for the distance cost.

Here is a corrected version of the code that follows the problem description:

```python
def func():
    r = lambda: map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = next(r)
        a = list(r())
        m = next(r())
        closest = [0] * n
        for i in range(1, n):
            if i == n - 1 or a[i] - a[i - 1] < a[i + 1] - a[i]:
                closest[i] = i - 1
            else:
                closest[i] = i + 1
        closest[0] = 1  # Closest city to the first city is the second city
        closest[n - 1] = n - 2  # Closest city to the last city is the second last city

        def min_cost(x, y):
            cost = 0
            while x != y:
                if abs(x - y) == 1:
                    cost += abs(a[x - 1] - a[y - 1])
                    break
                if closest[x - 1] == y - 1:
                    cost += 1
                    break
                cost += 1
                x = closest[x - 1] + 1
            return cost

        for _ in range(m):
            (c, d) = r()
            if c > d:
                c, d = d, c
            print(min_cost(c, d))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected code correctly calculates the closest city for each city and handles each query by either moving to the closest city for 1 coin or directly traveling to the destination city for the distance cost.
