You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node of the stone for each round.
def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: `numbers` is a list of all the pairs of integers read from the input until a non-pair input is encountered.
    return numbers
    #The program returns a list of all the pairs of integers read from the input until a non-pair input is encountered.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, an integer `t` which is always 1, and a list of `n-1` edges where each edge is a pair of integers representing the connections between nodes in the tree. Additionally, it accepts one integer `u_1` representing the starting node of the stone. The function returns a list of all the pairs of integers (edges) read from the input until a non-pair input is encountered.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of all the pairs of integers read from the input until a non-pair input is encountered.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
