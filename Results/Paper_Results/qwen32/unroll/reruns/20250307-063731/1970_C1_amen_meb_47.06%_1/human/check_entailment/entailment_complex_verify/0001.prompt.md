You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a tree with exactly two leaves and a single round of a game where a stone is moved between nodes. The objective is to determine the winner of the game based on the starting position of the stone. The game is played optimally by both players, Ron and Hermione.

### Key Points
1. The tree is an array-like structure with exactly two leaves.
2. The game starts with a stone on a given node, and players take turns moving the stone to an adjacent inactive node.
3. The player who cannot make a move loses.
4. We need to determine the winner for a single round given the starting node.

### Game Strategy
- If the starting node is closer to one leaf than the other, the player who starts (Ron) can force a win by always moving towards the farther leaf.
- If the starting node is equidistant from both leaves, the second player (Hermione) can force a win by mirroring Ron's moves.

### Program Analysis
The provided program does not correctly address the problem. Here are the issues:
1. The function `func_1()` is supposed to read the input, but it reads until it encounters a line that does not have exactly two elements, which is not the intended behavior.
2. The program does not calculate the distances from the starting node to the leaves, which is necessary to determine the winner.
3. The program does not handle the logic for determining the winner based on the starting node's position relative to the leaves.

### Correct Implementation
To solve the problem correctly, we need:
1. Identify the two leaves of the tree.
2. Calculate the distance from the starting node to each leaf.
3. Determine the winner based on the distances.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
