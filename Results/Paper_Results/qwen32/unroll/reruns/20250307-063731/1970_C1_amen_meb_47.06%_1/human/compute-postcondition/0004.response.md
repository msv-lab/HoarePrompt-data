Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, an integer `t` which is always 1, and a list of `n-1` edges where each edge is a pair of integers representing the connections between nodes in the tree. Additionally, it accepts one integer `u_1` representing the starting node of the stone. The function returns a list of all the pairs of integers (edges) read from the input until a non-pair input is encountered.**
