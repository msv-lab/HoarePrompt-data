In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least once regardless of the current state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to ensure that the loop can execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node of the stone for each round. `numbers` is an empty list.**
