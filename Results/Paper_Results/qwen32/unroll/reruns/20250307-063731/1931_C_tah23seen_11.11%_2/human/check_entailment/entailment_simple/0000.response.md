### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation of assigning a value to a subarray. The function `func_1` is supposed to solve this problem, but there are some issues in the logic that make it incorrect.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Palindrome Check**: The program checks if the array is a palindrome or all elements are the same by incrementing `i` and decrementing `j` until `arr[i] != arr[j]`. If `i > j`, it means all elements are the same, and no burles are needed. This part is correct.

2. **Handling Non-Palindrome Case**: If the array is not a palindrome, the program increments `i` until `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]`. This step is intended to find the first element that is different from its next element.

3. **Returning the Result**: The program then checks if `j` is not the last index of the array. If `j != len(arr) - 1`, it returns `j - i + 1`. However, this is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal way to make all elements the same with one operation. The correct approach should be to consider the minimum cost of making all elements equal to the most frequent element or handling the subarray assignment optimally.

4. **Final Return**: If `j` is the last index, it returns `j - i`. This part is also incorrect because it does not provide the minimum cost for making all elements the same.

The provided logic does not account for the optimal subarray assignment to minimize the cost. For example, it does not consider making all elements equal to the most frequent element or handling edge cases correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
