Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ n, and the length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function returns 0 if a certain condition is met. If the condition for Case_1 is not met, it returns the value of `j - i + 1` for some integers `i` and `j`. If neither of the first two conditions is met, it returns `j - i`, where `j` is the length of the list `arr` minus 1, and `i` is an undefined variable in the initial state.**
