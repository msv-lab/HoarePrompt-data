Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The task is to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal by applying the operation of assigning a value to a subarray at most once. The given program only checks if the array can be made equal by potentially changing the middle part of the array if the ends are the same, but it does not consider all possible cases or the optimal way to make the entire array equal.

Here are some issues with the provided code:
1. The function `func_1` only checks if the array can be made equal by changing a subarray in the middle if the ends are the same. It does not handle cases where the optimal solution involves changing the beginning, end, or a different part of the array.
2. The function does not consider the possibility of changing the entire array to a single value if it is more optimal.
3. The function does not correctly handle arrays where the optimal solution involves changing a subarray that is not in the middle.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the frequency of each element in the array and determine the most frequent element. The minimum cost will be the length of the array minus the frequency of the most frequent element, as we can change the rest of the array to this most frequent element. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    from collections import Counter
    count = Counter(arr)
    most_common_count = count.most_common(1)[0][1]
    return len(arr) - most_common_count

t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1
```

This corrected program calculates the frequency of each element and determines the minimum number of changes required to make all elements equal to the most frequent element.
