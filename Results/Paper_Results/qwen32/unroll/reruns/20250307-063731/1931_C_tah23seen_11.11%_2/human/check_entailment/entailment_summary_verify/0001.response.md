### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function `func_1` in the context of the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Recap

The task is to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation of assigning a value `x` to a contiguous subarray from index `i` to `j`. The cost of this operation is `(j - i + 1)` burles. We need to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

#### Provided Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself. It then calls the function `func_1` to compute the minimum cost and prints the result.

Here's the logic of `func_1(arr)`:

1. **Initialization and Symmetry Check:**
   - `i` is initialized to `0` and `j` to `len(arr) - 1`.
   - The program enters a while loop to check if elements from the start (`arr[i]`) and the end (`arr[j]`) of the array are equal. If they are, it moves the pointers inward (`i += 1` and `j -= 1`).
   - If at any point `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`, the loop breaks.

2. **Handling Fully Equal Array:**
   - If `i > j` after the loop, it means the entire array was equal, and no operation is needed, so it returns `0`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Cost:**
   - It then checks if the current element at `i` is the same as the next element (`arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`). If so, it increments `i` to find the boundary of the equal segment.
   - If `j` is not at the end of the array (`j != len(arr) - 1`), it calculates the cost as `j - i + 1` and returns it.
   - If `j` is at the end of the array, it still calculates the cost as `j - i + 1` and returns it.

#### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Handling of the Case Where `j` is at the End:**
  - The logic does not correctly handle the scenario where the array has a segment of equal elements at the beginning and a different segment at the end. For example, in the array `[1, 1, 1, 2]`, the program would return `1` because `j` is at the end, but the correct answer should be `2` (changing the last element to `1`).

- **Lack of Consideration for Different Segments:**
  - The program does not consider the possibility of different segments within the array that could be made equal with a single operation. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, the correct answer should be `2` (changing either the first two or the last two elements), but the program might not handle this correctly.

- **Function Summary Misalignment:**
  - The function summary provided does not accurately describe the behavior of `func_1`. The summary states that `func_1` returns the length of the longest palindromic suffix of the list, which is not what the function actually does.

#### Correctness Evaluation

Given the above issues, the program is not correctly computing the minimum number of burles required in all cases. The function `func_1` does not handle all edge cases and does not accurately compute the minimum cost as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
