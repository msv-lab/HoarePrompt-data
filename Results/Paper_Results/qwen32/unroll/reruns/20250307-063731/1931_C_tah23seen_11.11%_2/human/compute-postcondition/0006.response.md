Postcondition: **If the list is a palindrome or all elements are the same, `i` will be equal to `j + 1` (or `j` will be equal to `i - 1`), and the loop will have finished executing without breaking early. If the list is not a palindrome, `i` and `j` will point to the first pair of elements that do not match, and the loop will have broken at that point. Additionally, `i` is not greater than `j`.**
