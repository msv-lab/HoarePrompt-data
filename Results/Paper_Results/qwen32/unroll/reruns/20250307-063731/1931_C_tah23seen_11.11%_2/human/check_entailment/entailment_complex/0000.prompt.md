Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the length of arr, denoted as n, satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function is called once for each test case, and the total number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: - If the list is a palindrome or all elements are the same, `i` will be equal to `j + 1` (or `j` will be equal to `i - 1`), and the loop will have finished executing without breaking early.
    #- If the list is not a palindrome, `i` and `j` will point to the first pair of elements that do not match, and the loop will have broken at that point.
    #
    #Since the problem asks for a single output state, we consider the most general case where the list may or may not be a palindrome. Therefore, the output state is described as follows:
    #
    #Output State:
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: If the list is a palindrome or all elements are the same, `i` will be equal to `j + 1` (or `j` will be equal to `i - 1`), and the loop will have finished executing without breaking early. If the list is not a palindrome, `i` and `j` will point to the first pair of elements that do not match, and the loop will have broken at that point. Additionally, `i` is not greater than `j`.
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: 
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the value of `j - i + 1`
    #State: `j` is an integer, `arr` is a list, and `j` is equal to the length of `arr` minus 1.
    return j - i
    #The program returns j - i, where j is an integer equal to the length of the list arr minus 1, and i is an undefined variable in the given initial state
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input and returns 0 if the list is a palindrome or all elements are the same. Otherwise, it returns the length of the longest palindromic suffix of the list.
