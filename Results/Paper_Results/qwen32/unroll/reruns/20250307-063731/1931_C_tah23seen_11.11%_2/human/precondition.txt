arr is a list of integers representing the array a, where the first element of arr is the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) denoting the size of the array, and the subsequent n elements are the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the array elements. The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
