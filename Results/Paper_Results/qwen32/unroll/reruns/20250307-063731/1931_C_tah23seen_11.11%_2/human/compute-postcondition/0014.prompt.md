You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the length of arr, denoted as n, satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function is called once for each test case, and the total number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: - If the list is a palindrome or all elements are the same, `i` will be equal to `j + 1` (or `j` will be equal to `i - 1`), and the loop will have finished executing without breaking early.
    #- If the list is not a palindrome, `i` and `j` will point to the first pair of elements that do not match, and the loop will have broken at that point.
    #
    #Since the problem asks for a single output state, we consider the most general case where the list may or may not be a palindrome. Therefore, the output state is described as follows:
    #
    #Output State:
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: If the list is a palindrome or all elements are the same, `i` will be equal to `j + 1` (or `j` will be equal to `i - 1`), and the loop will have finished executing without breaking early. If the list is not a palindrome, `i` and `j` will point to the first pair of elements that do not match, and the loop will have broken at that point. Additionally, `i` is not greater than `j`.
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: 
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the value of `j - i + 1`
    #State: `j` is an integer, `arr` is a list, and `j` is equal to the length of `arr` minus 1.
    return j - i
    #The program returns j - i, where j is an integer equal to the length of the list arr minus 1, and i is an undefined variable in the given initial state
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ n, and the length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function returns 0 if a certain condition is met. If the condition for Case_1 is not met, it returns the value of `j - i + 1` for some integers `i` and `j`. If neither of the first two conditions is met, it returns `j - i`, where `j` is the length of the list `arr` minus 1, and `i` is an undefined variable in the initial state.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the value of `j - i + 1`

Case_3: The program returns j - i, where j is an integer equal to the length of the list arr minus 1, and i is an undefined variable in the given initial state


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
