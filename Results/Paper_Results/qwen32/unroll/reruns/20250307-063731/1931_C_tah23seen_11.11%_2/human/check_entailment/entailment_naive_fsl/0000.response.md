Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for making all elements of the array equal using the minimum number of burles. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample.

The function `func_1` attempts to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal by focusing on the longest prefix and suffix of the array that are equal. It then calculates the cost based on the remaining elements that need to be changed. However, this approach is flawed as it does not consider the optimal way to choose the range `[i, j]` and the value `x` to minimize the cost.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To make all elements equal, we can choose `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2`. This will change the array to `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` with a cost of `3 - 2 + 1 = 2` burles. Then, we can choose `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` to make the entire array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` with a cost of `5 - 1 + 1 = 5` burles. However, we can achieve the same result in just one operation by choosing `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` directly, which also costs `5 - 1 + 1 = 5` burles. The optimal solution is to choose `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` first, and then `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2`, but since we can only perform the operation once, the optimal single operation is to choose `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` directly, which costs `5 - 1 + 1 = 5` burles. However, the optimal solution with one operation is to choose `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` and then `i = 1`, `j = 1`, and `x = 2` or `i = 5`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` which costs `3 - 2 + 1 = 2` burles.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
2
```

While the program seems to give the correct answer for this specific case, it does not guarantee the correct answer for all cases. For example, consider the following input:

**Input:**
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To make all elements equal, we can choose `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 3`. This will change the array to `[1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2]` with a cost of `5 - 2 + 1 = 4` burles. Then, we can choose `i = 1`, `j = 6`, and `x = 3` to make the entire array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` with a cost of `6 - 1 + 1 = 6` burles. However, we can achieve the same result in just one operation by choosing `i = 1`, `j = 6`, and `x = 3` directly, which also costs `6 - 1 + 1 = 6` burles. The optimal solution is to choose `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 3` first, and then `i = 1`, `j = 1`, and `x = 3` or `i = 6`, `j = 6`, and `x = 3`, which costs `5 - 2 + 1 = 4` burles. However, the optimal solution with one operation is to choose `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 3` directly, which costs `5 - 2 + 1 = 4` burles. However, the optimal solution with one operation is to choose `i = 1`, `j = 3`, and `x = 3` and then `i = 4`, `j = 6`, and `x = 3` which costs `3 - 1 + 1 = 3` burles.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
4
```

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all cases, and the correctness is **False**.
