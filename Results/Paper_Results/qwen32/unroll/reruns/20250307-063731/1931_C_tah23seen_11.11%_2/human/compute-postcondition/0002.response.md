To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the loop condition `i <= j`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - `i` and `j` are the variables in the loop condition `i <= j`.

2. **Understand the Initial States:**
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `j` is initialized to `len(arr) - 1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `i <= j` must be true.
   - Given `i` is 0, `j` must be at least 0 for the condition to hold.

4. **Check the Initial State of `j`:**
   - `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - For `j` to be at least 0, `len(arr)` must be at least 1.

5. **Adjust the State if Necessary:**
   - Since `arr` is a list of integers where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `n` is the length of `arr`, `arr` must have at least one element for `len(arr) - 1` to be 0 or more.
   - Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `arr` because the problem guarantees that `arr` has at least one element (`1 <= n`).

Given the above analysis, the initial state already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary.

**State:** **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq a_i \leq n \), and the length of `arr`, denoted as `n`, satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \). `i` is 0. `j` is `len(arr) - 1`**
