You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

If the list is not a palindrome, `i` and `j` will point to the first pair of elements that do not match, and the loop will have broken at that point. Additionally, `i` is not greater than `j`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for making all elements of the array equal using the minimum number of burles. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample.

The function `func_1` attempts to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal by focusing on the longest prefix and suffix of the array that are equal. It then calculates the cost based on the remaining elements that need to be changed. However, this approach is flawed as it does not consider the optimal way to choose the range `[i, j]` and the value `x` to minimize the cost.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To make all elements equal, we can choose `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2`. This will change the array to `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` with a cost of `3 - 2 + 1 = 2` burles. Then, we can choose `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` to make the entire array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` with a cost of `5 - 1 + 1 = 5` burles. However, we can achieve the same result in just one operation by choosing `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` directly, which also costs `5 - 1 + 1 = 5` burles. The optimal solution is to choose `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` first, and then `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2`, but since we can only perform the operation once, the optimal single operation is to choose `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` directly, which costs `5 - 1 + 1 = 5` burles. However, the optimal solution with one operation is to choose `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` and then `i = 1`, `j = 1`, and `x = 2` or `i = 5`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` which costs `3 - 2 + 1 = 2` burles.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
2
```

While the program seems to give the correct answer for this specific case, it does not guarantee the correct answer for all cases. For example, consider the following input:

**Input:**
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To make all elements equal, we can choose `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 3`. This will change the array to `[1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2]` with a cost of `5 - 2 + 1 = 4` burles. Then, we can choose `i = 1`, `j = 6`, and `x = 3` to make the entire array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` with a cost of `6 - 1 + 1 = 6` burles. However, we can achieve the same result in just one operation by choosing `i = 1`, `j = 6`, and `x = 3` directly, which also costs `6 - 1 + 1 = 6` burles. The optimal solution is to choose `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 3` first, and then `i = 1`, `j = 1`, and `x = 3` or `i = 6`, `j = 6`, and `x = 3`, which costs `5 - 2 + 1 = 4` burles. However, the optimal solution with one operation is to choose `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 3` directly, which costs `5 - 2 + 1 = 4` burles. However, the optimal solution with one operation is to choose `i = 1`, `j = 3`, and `x = 3` and then `i = 4`, `j = 6`, and `x = 3` which costs `3 - 1 + 1 = 3` burles.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
4
```

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all cases, and the correctness is **False**.
