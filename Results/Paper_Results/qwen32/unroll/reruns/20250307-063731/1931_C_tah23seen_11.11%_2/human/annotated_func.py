#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the length of arr, denoted as n, satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function is called once for each test case, and the total number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: - If the list is a palindrome or all elements are the same, `i` will be equal to `j + 1` (or `j` will be equal to `i - 1`), and the loop will have finished executing without breaking early.
    #- If the list is not a palindrome, `i` and `j` will point to the first pair of elements that do not match, and the loop will have broken at that point.
    #
    #Since the problem asks for a single output state, we consider the most general case where the list may or may not be a palindrome. Therefore, the output state is described as follows:
    #
    #Output State:
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: If the list is a palindrome or all elements are the same, `i` will be equal to `j + 1` (or `j` will be equal to `i - 1`), and the loop will have finished executing without breaking early. If the list is not a palindrome, `i` and `j` will point to the first pair of elements that do not match, and the loop will have broken at that point. Additionally, `i` is not greater than `j`.
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: 
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the value of `j - i + 1`
    #State: `j` is an integer, `arr` is a list, and `j` is equal to the length of `arr` minus 1.
    return j - i
    #The program returns j - i, where j is an integer equal to the length of the list arr minus 1, and i is an undefined variable in the given initial state
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input and returns 0 if the list is a palindrome or all elements are the same. Otherwise, it returns the length of the longest palindromic suffix of the list.
