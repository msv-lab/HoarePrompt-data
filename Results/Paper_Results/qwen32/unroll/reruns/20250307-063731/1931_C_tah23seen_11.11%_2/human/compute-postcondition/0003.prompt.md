Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq a_i \leq n \), and the length of `arr`, denoted as `n`, satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \). The function is called once for each test case, and the total number of test cases, `t`, satisfies \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \). The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \). `i` is 0. `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while i <= j:
    if arr[i] == arr[j]:
        i += 1
        j -= 1
    else:
        break



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
