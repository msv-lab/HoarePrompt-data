Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq a_i \leq n \), and the length of `arr`, denoted as `n`, satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \). The function is called once for each test case, and the total number of test cases, `t`, satisfies \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \). The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \). `i` is 0.**

In natural language: The list `arr` and its properties remain unchanged. The variable `i` is now set to 0. All other conditions and constraints specified in the initial state are still valid.
