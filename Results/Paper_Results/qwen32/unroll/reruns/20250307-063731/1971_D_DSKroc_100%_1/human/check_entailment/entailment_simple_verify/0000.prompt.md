You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string. Specifically, the condition `if flag == 0: print(count + 1)` is incorrect. The `flag` variable is set to `1` if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in the string, but this does not accurately determine whether the string is already sorted or if an additional piece is needed.

Let's analyze the program with the given examples and find a counterexample:

1. For the input "11010":
   - The program correctly identifies transitions from '1' to '0' and vice versa, resulting in `count = 3`.
   - Since there is a transition from '0' to '1', `flag` is set to `1`.
   - The program correctly prints `count = 3`.

2. For the input "00000000":
   - There are no transitions, so `count = 0` and `flag = 0`.
   - The program incorrectly prints `count + 1 = 1`, which is correct in this case but due to a flawed logic.

3. For the input "1":
   - There are no transitions, so `count = 0` and `flag = 0`.
   - The program incorrectly prints `count + 1 = 1`, which is correct in this case but due to a flawed logic.

4. For the input "10":
   - There is one transition, so `count = 1` and `flag = 1`.
   - The program correctly prints `count = 1`.

5. For the input "0001111":
   - There is one transition, so `count = 1` and `flag = 1`.
   - The program correctly prints `count = 1`.

6. For the input "0110":
   - There are two transitions, so `count = 2` and `flag = 1`.
   - The program correctly prints `count = 2`.

However, consider the input "110011":
- There are three transitions, so `count = 3` and `flag = 1`.
- The program correctly prints `count = 3`.

Now consider the input "001001":
- There are four transitions, so `count = 4` and `flag = 1`.
- The program incorrectly prints `count = 4`, but the correct answer should be `3` because we can split it into "00", "1", "00", "1" and rearrange it into "000011".

The issue arises because the program incorrectly adds `1` to `count` when `flag == 0`, which is not always necessary. The correct approach is to simply print `count + 1` without considering the `flag`.

Thus, the program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling the `flag` variable.
