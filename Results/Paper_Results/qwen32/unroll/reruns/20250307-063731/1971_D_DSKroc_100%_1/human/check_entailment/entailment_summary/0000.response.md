### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string such that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

The program provided calculates the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string. Each transition indicates a point where the string changes from '0' to '1' or from '1' to '0'. If there are no '0' to '1' transitions (which means the string is already sorted or consists only of '0's or '1's), the program adds one to the count to account for the entire string being one piece.

Let's break down the logic:
- **Counting Transitions**: The program correctly counts the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string.
- **Handling Sorted Strings**: If there are no '0' to '1' transitions, the program correctly outputs `count + 1`, which is `1` for a string that is already sorted (either all '0's or all '1's).
- **Handling Unsorted Strings**: For strings that are not sorted, the number of pieces needed is equal to the number of transitions, as each transition point indicates a new piece.

The program's logic aligns with the problem requirements and the execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior.
