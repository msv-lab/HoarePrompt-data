You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is a single binary string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()

        flag = 0

            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):

            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
        
    #State: For each test case, the number of transitions between '0' and '1' (or '1' and '0') plus one if no '0' to '1' transitions are present, otherwise just the number of transitions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts a binary string `s`. It then calculates and prints the number of transitions between '0' and '1' (or '1' and '0') in the string, plus one if there are no '0' to '1' transitions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and see if it accurately computes the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange a binary string into a sorted one.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to split the binary string into the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's before all '1's).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the string is already sorted, only one piece is needed.
   - Each transition from '1' to '0' indicates a potential boundary where the string needs to be cut. However, transitions from '0' to '1' do not necessarily require a cut since '0's can be before '1's in the sorted version.
   - The number of pieces needed is one more than the number of transitions from '1' to '0'.

3. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string.
   - It initializes `count` to 0 (to count transitions from '1' to '0') and `flag` to 0 (to check if there's any '0' followed by '1').
   - It iterates through the string and increments `count` whenever it encounters a transition from '1' to '0'.
   - It sets `flag` to 1 if it encounters a transition from '0' to '1'.
   - If no '0' is followed by '1' (`flag` remains 0), it prints `count + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `count`.

4. **Verification Against Test Cases:**
   - For the string "11010":
     - Transitions: '1' to '0' at positions 1 and 3.
     - `count` = 2.
     - `flag` = 1 (since there's a '0' followed by '1').
     - Output = `count` = 2 + 1 (incorrect, should be 3).
   - For the string "00000000":
     - No transitions.
     - `count` = 0.
     - `flag` = 0.
     - Output = `count` + 1 = 1 (correct).
   - For the string "1":
     - No transitions.
     - `count` = 0.
     - `flag` = 0.
     - Output = `count` + 1 = 1 (correct).
   - For the string "10":
     - Transition: '1' to '0' at position 0.
     - `count` = 1.
     - `flag` = 1.
     - Output = `count` = 1 (correct).
   - For the string "0001111":
     - No transitions.
     - `count` = 0.
     - `flag` = 0.
     - Output = `count` + 1 = 1 (correct).
   - For the string "0110":
     - Transition: '0' to '1' at position 0.
     - Transition: '1' to '0' at position 2.
     - `count` = 1.
     - `flag` = 1.
     - Output = `count` = 1 (incorrect, should be 2).

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly handles the case where the string needs to be cut at the end (i.e., when the string ends with '0' after a '1'). The program should always add 1 to the `count` regardless of the `flag` value, as the number of pieces is one more than the number of '1' to '0' transitions.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
