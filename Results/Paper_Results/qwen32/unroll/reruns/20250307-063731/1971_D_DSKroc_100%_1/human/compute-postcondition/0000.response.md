The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This value is then stored in the variable `t`. The other variables mentioned (`s` for the binary strings) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is a single binary string `s` (1 ≤ |`s`| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. `t` is an input integer.**
