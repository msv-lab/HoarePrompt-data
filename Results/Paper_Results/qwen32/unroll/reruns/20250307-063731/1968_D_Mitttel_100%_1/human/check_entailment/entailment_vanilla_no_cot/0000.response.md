Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The program incorrectly adjusts the values in arrays `a` and `p` by subtracting 1, which is unnecessary and incorrect. The problem description uses 1-based indexing, and the program should work with 1-based indexing directly without adjusting the values.

2. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position, but the logic for calculating `mx` is incorrect. The line `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` is incorrect because it assumes that the player can stay on the same position `k` times, which is not the case. The player can either stay or move to the next position in each turn, and the score should be calculated accordingly.

3. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle cycles in the permutation. If the player enters a cycle, they can only stay in the cycle for a certain number of turns, and the score calculation should reflect that.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    score = 0
    vis = [0] * n
    cycle = []
    cycle_found = False
    cycle_length = 0
    cycle_score = 0
    
    # Find the cycle and the path to it
    while k > 0 and not vis[s]:
        vis[s] = 1
        score += a[s]
        k -= 1
        if not cycle_found and vis[p[s] - 1]:
            cycle_found = True
            cycle_start = p[s] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        if cycle_found:
            cycle_length += 1
            cycle_score += a[s]
    
    if k == 0:
        return score
    
    # If we are in a cycle
    if cycle_found:
        full_cycles = k // cycle_length
        remaining_turns = k % cycle_length
        score += full_cycles * cycle_score
        for _ in range(remaining_turns):
            score += a[s]
            s = p[s] - 1
    
    return score

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    A = func_1(a, p, pb, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')
```

This corrected version handles cycles and calculates the score correctly for each player.
