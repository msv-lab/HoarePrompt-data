### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the given rules and multiple test cases. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, which represent the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices**:
   - The program adjusts the indices of the permutation `p` and the array `a` to be 0-based by subtracting 1 from each element. This is a common practice in programming to simplify array indexing.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program defines a function `func_1` to calculate the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` within `k` turns.
   - Inside `func_1`, it initializes variables to keep track of the maximum score (`mx`), the current accumulated score (`cur`), and a visited list (`vis`) to avoid revisiting the same positions.
   - The function then enters a loop that continues until the player revisits a position (i.e., a cycle is detected) or until `k` turns have been completed.
   - In each iteration of the loop:
     - It marks the current position as visited.
     - It updates the maximum score by considering the score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns.
     - It adds the current position's score to the accumulated score.
     - It decrements the number of remaining turns.
     - It moves to the next position in the permutation.
   - The function returns the maximum score calculated.

4. **Determining the Winner**:
   - The program calculates the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `func_1` function.
   - It then compares the scores and prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input parsing, index adjustment, score calculation, and winner determination accurately. The use of a visited list ensures that the program does not enter an infinite loop when a cycle is detected in the permutation. The time complexity is efficient given the constraints, as it processes each position at most once per test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
