Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the line `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` is incorrect. This line assumes that the player can stay in the current position `s` and collect the score `k * a[s]` for the remaining `k` turns. However, the problem description states that the player can either stay at the current position or move to `p[s]`. Therefore, the player can only collect the score `a[s]` for the current turn and then either stay or move to `p[s]`.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    return mx
```

In this corrected version, `mx` is updated with the score after each turn, considering only the score from the current position `s` and not the score from staying in the same position for the remaining `k` turns.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

Expected Output:
```
Bodya
```

With the original program, the output might be incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_1`. The corrected program should handle this case and all other cases correctly.
