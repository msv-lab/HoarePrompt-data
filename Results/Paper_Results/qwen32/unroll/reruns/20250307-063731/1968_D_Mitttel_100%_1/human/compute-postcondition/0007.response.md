Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9; `p`, a list of `n` integers representing a permutation; and `s`, a tuple containing four integers `(n, k, P_B, P_S)` where `n` is the length of the permutation and array `a`, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `P_B` and `P_S` are integers between 1 and `n`. The function returns `mx`, which is the maximum value calculated during the loop.**
