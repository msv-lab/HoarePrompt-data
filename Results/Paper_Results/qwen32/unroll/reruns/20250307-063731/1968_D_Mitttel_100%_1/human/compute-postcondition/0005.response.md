To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the loop's behavior based on the given initial state and the loop's logic.

### Initial State Recap:
- `a`: A list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\).
- `p`: A list of `n` integers representing a permutation of indices from 0 to \(n-1\).
- `s`: A tuple containing four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S), where:
  - `n` is the length of the permutation and array `a`.
  - `k` is the number of iterations allowed.
  - `P_B` and `P_S` are integers between 1 and `n`.
- `mx`: Initialized to 0.
- `cur`: Initialized to 0.
- `vis`: A list of `n` zeros, used to track visited states.

### Loop Logic:
1. The loop continues as long as the current state `s` has not been visited (`vis[s] == 0`) and `k` is greater than 0.
2. Inside the loop:
   - The current state `s` is marked as visited by setting `vis[s]` to 1.
   - The maximum value (`mx`) is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`.
   - `cur` is incremented by `a[s]`.
   - `k` is decremented by 1.
   - The state `s` is updated to `p[s]`.

### Analysis:
- The loop is essentially a traversal of a permutation graph starting from the initial state `s` (which is the tuple `(n, k, P_B, P_S)`). However, the tuple `s` is not directly used as an index in the array `a` or `p`. This suggests that the state `s` is being used in a way that might not directly map to the indices of `a` or `p` as initially expected.
- Given the structure of the loop and the fact that `s` is a tuple, it's likely that the loop is intended to use the index `s` modulo `n` to access elements in `a` and `p`. However, since `s` is a tuple, we need to clarify the exact index being used.

### Assumption:
- We assume that the tuple `s` is being used to index into `a` and `p` in a way that the first element of `s` (which is `n`) is being used to index into `a` and `p`. This is a common mistake in the problem statement, and we will assume this for the purpose of this analysis.

### Execution:
- The loop will traverse the permutation graph starting from the index `n-1` (since `s` is `(n, k, P_B, P_S)` and we assume `n-1` is the starting index).
- The loop will continue until either the state `s` is revisited or `k` becomes 0.
- During each iteration, `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`.
- `cur` accumulates the sum of the elements visited in the permutation.
- `k` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.

### Output State:
- After the loop finishes, the values of `mx`, `cur`, and `vis` will be updated based on the traversal.
- The tuple `s` will be the last state visited before the loop terminates.
- The values of `a`, `p`, and the other elements of `s` (n, k, P_B, P_S) remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:
Given the assumptions and the loop's behavior, the output state will be:

Output State: **`mx` is the maximum value calculated during the loop, `cur` is the accumulated sum of the elements visited, `vis` is a list of `n` integers where some elements are set to 1 indicating visited states, and `s` is the last state visited before the loop terminates.**

In simpler terms, the output state will have `mx` as the maximum value found, `cur` as the sum of the elements visited, `vis` indicating which states were visited, and `s` as the last state visited.
