Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the function summary to ensure everything aligns correctly with the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a "Permutation Game" where two players, Bodya and Sasha, move through a permutation array `p` and collect scores from an array `a` over `k` turns. Each player can either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by `p` at each turn. The goal is to determine who has the higher score after `k` turns.

### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` with `k` turns. It iterates through the permutation, updating the current score `cur` and decrementing `k` until `k` reaches zero or a cycle is detected. The function keeps track of visited positions using a `vis` list to prevent infinite loops.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It adjusts `P_B` and `P_S` to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1.
   - It also adjusts the elements of `p` and `a` to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1. This adjustment is incorrect because `p` should not be zero-indexed; it should remain one-indexed as it represents positions in the permutation.

2. **Scoring Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum score by iterating through the permutation and updating the current score `cur` and decrementing `k`.
   - The function calculates the maximum score by considering staying at the current position for all remaining turns and moving to the next position `p[s]`.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The program calculates the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha using `func_1`.
   - It then compares these scores and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Index Adjustment**: The program incorrectly adjusts the elements of `p` to be zero-indexed. This adjustment is incorrect because `p` should represent positions in the permutation, which are one-indexed. Adjusting `p` to zero-indexed will lead to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
Given the issue with the incorrect adjustment of the permutation array `p`, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The adjustment of `p` should be removed to ensure the positions in the permutation are correctly interpreted.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate due to the incorrect adjustment of the permutation array `p`. The program does not correctly handle the permutation indices, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
