The given Python code snippet initializes a variable `mx` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables (`a`, `p`, and `s`). Therefore, the only change in the output state is the value of `mx`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `p` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing a permutation, `s` is a tuple containing four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and `n` is the length of the permutation and array `a`. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is 0.**
