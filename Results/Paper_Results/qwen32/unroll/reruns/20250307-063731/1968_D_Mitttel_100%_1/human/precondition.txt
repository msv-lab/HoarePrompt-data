a and p are lists of integers of length n, where each element in p is a distinct integer from 1 to n, s is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, and k is a non-negative integer. Additionally, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all 1 <= i <= n.
