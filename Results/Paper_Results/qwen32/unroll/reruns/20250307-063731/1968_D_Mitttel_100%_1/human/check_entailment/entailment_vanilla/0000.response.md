Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - The program adjusts `P_B` and `P_S` to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1.
   - It also adjusts the elements of `p` and `a` to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1.

2. **Scoring Calculation**:
   - The program defines a function `func_1` to calculate the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` with `k` turns.
   - Inside `func_1`, it initializes `mx` to 0 (which will store the maximum score) and `cur` to 0 (which will store the current score).
   - It uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to detect cycles.
   - The loop continues as long as the current position `s` has not been visited and `k` turns remain.
   - Inside the loop, it marks the current position as visited, updates the maximum score (`mx`) considering staying at the current position for all remaining turns, adds the current position's score to `cur`, decrements `k`, and moves to the next position `p[s]`.
   - The function returns the maximum score `mx`.

3. **Comparison**:
   - The program calculates the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha using `func_1`.
   - It then compares these scores and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Input Adjustments**: The program correctly adjusts the input indices to be zero-indexed, which is necessary for Python's zero-based indexing.
- **Cycle Detection**: The program uses a `vis` list to detect cycles, which is crucial because the game can potentially enter a cycle. Without cycle detection, the program could run indefinitely.
- **Score Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum score by considering the best possible score at each step, including staying at the current position for all remaining turns.
- **Comparison and Output**: The program correctly compares the scores and outputs the appropriate result.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all edge cases, such as cycles and the maximum number of turns, and correctly compares the scores to determine the winner.

Reasoning: The program correctly handles input parsing, cycle detection, score calculation, and comparison. It adheres to the problem's requirements and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
