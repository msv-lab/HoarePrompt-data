You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), p is a list of n integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing a permutation, s is a tuple containing four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and n is the length of the permutation and array a.
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: `mx` is the maximum value calculated during the loop, `cur` is the accumulated sum of the elements visited, `vis` is a list of `n` integers where some elements are set to 1 indicating visited states, and `s` is the last state visited before the loop terminates.
    return mx
    #The program returns `mx`, which is the maximum value calculated during the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9; `p`, a list of `n` integers representing a permutation; and `s`, a tuple containing four integers `(n, k, P_B, P_S)` where `n` is the length of the permutation and array `a`, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `P_B` and `P_S` are integers between 1 and `n`. The function returns `mx`, which is the maximum value calculated during the loop.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `mx`, which is the maximum value calculated during the loop.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
