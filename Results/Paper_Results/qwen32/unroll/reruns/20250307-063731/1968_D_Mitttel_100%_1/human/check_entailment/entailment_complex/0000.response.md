### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by simulating the game for both Bodya and Sasha. It uses a function `func_1` to calculate the maximum possible score each player can achieve starting from their respective positions. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation array `p` and the score array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices**:
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` to be zero-based for easier manipulation in Python.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - For each player, the program calls `func_1` to compute the maximum score possible starting from their respective starting positions.
   - `func_1` iterates through the permutation `p`, accumulating the score from the array `a` and keeping track of visited positions to detect cycles.
   - The function calculates the maximum possible score by considering the accumulated score and the remaining turns `k`.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After obtaining the maximum scores for both players, the program compares them and prints the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Cycle Detection**: The function uses a `vis` list to track visited positions to detect cycles. This is crucial because permutations can form cycles, and the game can repeat the same sequence of positions.
- **Score Calculation**: The function calculates the maximum possible score by considering the accumulated score and the remaining turns `k`. However, this part of the logic seems flawed. The expression `cur + k * a[s]` does not correctly account for the scenario where the player might choose to stay in the same position or move to the next position in the permutation. The correct approach should consider the best possible score for each turn, which might involve staying in the same position if it leads to a higher score.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum score for each player. The expression `cur + k * a[s]` does not accurately represent the best possible score for each player, especially considering the option to stay in the same position or move to the next position in the permutation.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
