The code snippet creates a list `vis` of length `n` where each element is initialized to 0. The variables `a`, `p`, `s`, `mx`, and `cur` are not modified by this code.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `p` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing a permutation, `s` is a tuple containing four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `n` is the length of the permutation and array `a`, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.**
