To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to ensure that both conditions in the loop head are satisfied:

1. `not vis[s]` - This condition requires that the element at index `s` in the list `vis` is `False` (or `0` since `vis` is initialized with zeros).
2. `k > 0` - This condition requires that the variable `k` is greater than `0`.

Let's analyze the provided state and identify the necessary adjustments:

- `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) - This does not affect the loop condition directly.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing a permutation - This does not affect the loop condition directly.
- `s` is a tuple containing four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `n` is the length of the permutation and array `a` - The value of `k` from this tuple is what we need to ensure is greater than `0`. Also, `s` is used as an index for the `vis` list, so we need to ensure `vis[s]` is `False` (or `0`).
- `n` is the length of the permutation and array `a` - This does not need adjustment.
- `mx` is 0 - This does not affect the loop condition directly.
- `cur` is 0 - This does not affect the loop condition directly.
- `vis` is a list of `n` zeros - This needs to be adjusted to ensure `vis[s]` is `0`.

Since `vis` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros, `vis[s]` will be `0` by default, satisfying the first condition. The second condition requires `k` to be greater than `0`. Since `k` is part of the tuple `s`, and `s` is defined as `(n, k, P_B, P_S)`, we need to ensure that `k` in this tuple is greater than `0`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `vis` since it is already a list of zeros. We just need to ensure that `k` in the tuple `s` is greater than `0`, which is already stated in the problem constraints (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `p` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing a permutation, `s` is a tuple containing four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `n` is the length of the permutation and array `a`, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros**
