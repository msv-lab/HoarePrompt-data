The code snippet provided initializes a variable `cur` to 0. No other variables are affected by this code. The initial state of the other variables (`a`, `p`, `s`, and `mx`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `p` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing a permutation, `s` is a tuple containing four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and `n` is the length of the permutation and array `a`. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is 0. `cur` is 0.**
