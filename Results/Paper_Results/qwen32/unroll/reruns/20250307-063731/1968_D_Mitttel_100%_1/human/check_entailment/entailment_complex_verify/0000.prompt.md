You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

    Sasha
    Sasha
    Bodya
    
Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), p is a list of n integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing a permutation, s is a tuple containing four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and n is the length of the permutation and array a.

    #State: `mx` is the maximum value calculated during the loop, `cur` is the accumulated sum of the elements visited, `vis` is a list of `n` integers where some elements are set to 1 indicating visited states, and `s` is the last state visited before the loop terminates.
    return mx
    #The program returns `mx`, which is the maximum value calculated during the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the maximum value of a specific expression `cur + k * a[s]` as it iterates through a permutation of indices, updating the current sum `cur` and decrementing `k` until `k` reaches zero or a cycle is detected.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the line `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` is incorrect. This line assumes that the player can stay in the current position `s` and collect the score `k * a[s]` for the remaining `k` turns. However, the problem description states that the player can either stay at the current position or move to `p[s]`. Therefore, the player can only collect the score `a[s]` for the current turn and then either stay or move to `p[s]`.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    return mx
```

In this corrected version, `mx` is updated with the score after each turn, considering only the score from the current position `s` and not the score from staying in the same position for the remaining `k` turns.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

Expected Output:
```
Bodya
```

With the original program, the output might be incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_1`. The corrected program should handle this case and all other cases correctly.
