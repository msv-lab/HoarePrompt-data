### Reasoning:

The task is to determine the winner of a game based on given rules and inputs. The game involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in a permutation and score points based on an array of values. Both players can either stay or move to the next position in the permutation on each turn. The goal is to determine who will have the higher score after exactly `k` turns.

The provided program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of turns `k`, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha. It also reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`. The program then calculates the maximum score that each player can achieve starting from their respective positions using the `func_1` function and compares these scores to determine the winner.

The `func_1` function calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` and playing for `k` turns. It does this by iterating through the permutation, updating the current score `cur` with the value from the array `a` at the current position, and considering the possibility of staying at the current position for the remaining turns to maximize the score. The function stops iterating if a cycle is detected (i.e., a position is revisited) or if `k` turns have been completed.

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, reads the required inputs: `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It adjusts the indices in `p` and `a` to be zero-based for easier array indexing in Python.

2. **Score Calculation (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score for a player starting at position `s` and playing for `k` turns.
   - It uses a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions to detect cycles.
   - The function correctly updates the current score `cur` and the maximum score `mx` as it iterates through the permutation.
   - It considers the scenario where the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns to maximize the score (`mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`).

3. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the maximum scores for both players, the program compares them and prints the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and inputs. It handles multiple test cases, calculates the maximum possible scores for both players, and correctly determines the winner or if the game ends in a draw.

### Correctness:
