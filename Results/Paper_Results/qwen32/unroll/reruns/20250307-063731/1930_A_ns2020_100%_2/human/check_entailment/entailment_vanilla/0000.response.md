Reasoning:
To solve the problem, we need to maximize the score by optimally performing the given moves. The key insight is that to maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available numbers together. This is because choosing the smallest numbers ensures that we are adding the largest possible minimum values to our score.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the integer `n`, which indicates that there are `2n` numbers on the whiteboard.
   - It reads the `2n` integers and stores them in the list `A`.
   - It sorts the list `A` in ascending order.
   - It calculates the score by summing every second element from the sorted list `A` starting from the first element (i.e., `A[0]`, `A[2]`, `A[4]`, ..., `A[2n-2]`).
   - It prints the calculated score.
3. The program repeats the process for all test cases.

By sorting the list and summing every second element, the program effectively pairs the smallest numbers together, ensuring that the score is maximized.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the program, this approach is correct and will yield the maximum possible score for each test case.
