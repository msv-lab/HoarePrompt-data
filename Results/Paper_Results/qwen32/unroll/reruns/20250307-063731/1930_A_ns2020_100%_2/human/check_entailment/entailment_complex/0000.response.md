### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to maximize the score by choosing pairs of integers from a list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. The optimal strategy to achieve the maximum score is to always pair the smallest available integers together. This is because adding the smaller of two numbers to the score will always yield the highest possible score given the constraints.

The provided program implements this strategy by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. Sorting the list of integers.
4. Summing up the first `n` elements of the sorted list (which are the smallest `n` integers).
5. Printing the sum for each test case.

This approach ensures that we are always adding the minimum of each pair to the score, thereby maximizing the score as required by the problem statement.
