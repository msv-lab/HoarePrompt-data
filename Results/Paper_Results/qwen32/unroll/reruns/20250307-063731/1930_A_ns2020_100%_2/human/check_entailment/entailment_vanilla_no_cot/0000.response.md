Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the strategy to achieve the maximum final score by sorting the list of numbers and summing up every second number starting from the first (which are the smallest numbers in each pair). This ensures that the minimum of each pair is always added to the score, maximizing the final score as required by the problem description.
