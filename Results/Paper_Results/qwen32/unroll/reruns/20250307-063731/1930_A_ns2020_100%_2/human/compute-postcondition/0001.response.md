The only variable in the loop head is `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is truthy, which means `t` should be greater than 0. Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `t` will always be greater than 0, and thus the loop can certainly execute one time.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `t` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a list of 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7.**
