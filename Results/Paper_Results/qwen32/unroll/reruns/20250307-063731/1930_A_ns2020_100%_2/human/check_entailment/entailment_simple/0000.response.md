### Reasoning:

To determine the maximum final score, we need to optimally choose pairs of integers from the whiteboard such that the sum of the minimum values of these pairs is maximized. 

The optimal strategy involves sorting the list of integers in ascending order and then pairing the smallest integers together. This way, we ensure that the minimum value in each pair is as large as possible given the sorted order.

In the provided program:
1. The number of test cases `t` is read.
2. For each test case:
   - The value of `n` is read.
   - The list `A` of `2n` integers is read and sorted.
   - The sum of every second element starting from the first element (i.e., the minimum of each pair) is computed and printed. This is done using `sum(A[::2])`, which correctly sums up the elements at even indices of the sorted list.

This approach ensures that we are always adding the smallest possible values in each step, thus maximizing the final score.

### Execution States:
- **First Test Case**: `n = 1`, `A = [2, 3]`. After sorting, `A = [2, 3]`. The sum of every second element is `2`, which matches the expected output.
- **Second Test Case**: `n = 2`, `A = [1, 1, 2, 1]`. After sorting, `A = [1, 1, 1, 2]`. The sum of every second element is `1 + 1 = 2`, which matches the expected output.
- **Third Test Case**: `n = 3`, `A = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. After sorting, `A = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. The sum of every second element is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`, which matches the expected output.

Since the program correctly implements the optimal strategy and the outputs match the expected results for the given test cases, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
