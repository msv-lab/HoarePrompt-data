Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a list of 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, which is within the range of 1 to 5000. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged as the code snippet only affects `t`.
