To determine the Output State, we need to understand the impact of the line `a = func_1(d)` on the variables. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we can only infer based on the given initial state and the action of assigning its output to `a`.

Given:
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree.
- `d` contains the distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices in the tree.

The line `a = func_1(d)` suggests that `func_1` takes `d` as an argument and returns some value, which is then assigned to `a`. Since we donâ€™t have the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `a`, but we can state that `a` will hold whatever `func_1(d)` returns.

Thus, the Output State will be:
Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` contains the distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices in the tree; `a` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`.**
