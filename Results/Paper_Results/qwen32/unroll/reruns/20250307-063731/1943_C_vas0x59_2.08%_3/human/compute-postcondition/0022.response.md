Postcondition: **`path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `0` in reverse order, including both `b` and `0`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list of tuples where each tuple is `(c, i)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `ci` (inclusive), where `c` is the middle vertex of `path_ba` and `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list of tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for `i` values `1, 3, 5, ..., (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`.**
