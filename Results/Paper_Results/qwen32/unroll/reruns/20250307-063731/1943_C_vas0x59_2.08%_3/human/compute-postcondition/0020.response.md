The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters (1, `len(path_ba) - c1`, 2). To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the range has at least one valid value for `i`.

Let's break it down:

1. The loop starts at `i = 1`.
2. The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration.
3. The loop continues as long as `i < len(path_ba) - c1`.

For the loop to execute, `len(path_ba) - c1` must be greater than 1 (since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 2).

Given:
- `c2 = len(path_ba) // 2`
- `c1 = c2 - 1`

So, `len(path_ba) - c1` can be simplified as:
- `len(path_ba) - (c2 - 1)`
- `len(path_ba) - ((len(path_ba) // 2) - 1)`
- `len(path_ba) - len(path_ba) // 2 + 1`
- `(len(path_ba) // 2) + 1` (if `len(path_ba)` is even)

To ensure the loop executes, `(len(path_ba) // 2) + 1` must be greater than 1, which means `len(path_ba) // 2` must be at least 1. Therefore, `len(path_ba)` must be at least 4.

So, the conditions for the loop to execute are:
- `path_ba` must have at least 4 elements.
- `i` should start at 1.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `0` in reverse order, including both `b` and `0`, and must have at least 4 elements; `ops` is an empty list; `i` is 1**
