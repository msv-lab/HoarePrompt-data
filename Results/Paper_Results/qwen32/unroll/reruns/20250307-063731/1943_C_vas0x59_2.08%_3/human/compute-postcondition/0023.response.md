To determine the output of `print(len(ops))`, we need to understand how `ops` is constructed based on the length of `path_ba`.

Given:
- `path_ba` is a list containing vertices from `b` to `0` in reverse order, including both `b` and `0`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list of tuples where each tuple is `(c, i)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `ci` (inclusive), where `c` is the middle vertex of `path_ba` and `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list of tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for `i` values `1, 3, 5, ..., (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`.

Let's break this down:

1. **Length of `path_ba` is odd:**
   - `c` is the middle vertex of `path_ba`.
   - `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`.
   - `ops` will contain tuples `(c, i)` for each `i` from `0` to `ci`.
   - The number of tuples in `ops` will be `ci + 1`.

2. **Length of `path_ba` is even:**
   - `c1` and `c2` are the two middle vertices of `path_ba`.
   - `ops` will contain tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for `i` values `1, 3, 5, ..., (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`.
   - The number of tuples in `ops` will be twice the number of `i` values used, which is half the length of the range from `1` to `(len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)` with a step of `2`.

Since the exact `path_ba` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `len(ops)`. However, we can describe it based on the length of `path_ba` and the conditions given.

Let's formulate the output:

- If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `len(ops)` will be `ci + 1`.
- If `len(path_ba)` is even, `len(ops)` will be twice the number of `i` values from `1` to `(len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)` with a step of `2`.

Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is determined by the length of path_ba and the conditions given for constructing ops)**
