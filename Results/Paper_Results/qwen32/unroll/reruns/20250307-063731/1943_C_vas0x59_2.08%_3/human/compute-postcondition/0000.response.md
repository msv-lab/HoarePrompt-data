The code snippet provided is:
```
n = int(input())
```

This code reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `u2vs`, which is a list of lists representing the adjacency of vertices in a tree, is not affected by this code snippet. The precondition for `n` is that it represents the number of vertices in the tree and is within the range 1 to 2 * 10^3. After executing the code, `n` will hold the specific integer value provided by the input.

Output State: **u2vs is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the vertices adjacent to the corresponding vertex in the tree, n is the input integer representing the number of vertices in the tree such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3.**
