Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `0` in reverse order, including both `b` and `0`; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.**

In simpler terms, the length of `path_ba` remains even, `ops` remains an empty list, and `c2` is calculated as half the length of `path_ba`.
