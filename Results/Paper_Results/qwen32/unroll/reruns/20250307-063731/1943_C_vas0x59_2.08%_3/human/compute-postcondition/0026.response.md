Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `u2vs`, which is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the vertices adjacent to the corresponding vertex in the tree, and `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3. The function returns None.**
