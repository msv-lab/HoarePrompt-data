The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `ops`. It does not affect the variable `path_ba`, which remains unchanged as a list containing the vertices from `b` to `0` in reverse order, including both `b` and `0`.

Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `0` in reverse order, including both `b` and `0`; `ops` is an empty list.**
