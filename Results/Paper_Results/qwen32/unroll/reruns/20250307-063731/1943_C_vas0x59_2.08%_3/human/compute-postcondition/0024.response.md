Let's break down the given task and determine what will be printed based on the initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `0` in reverse order, including both `b` and `0`.
2. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list of tuples where each tuple is `(c, i)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `ci` (inclusive), where `c` is the middle vertex of `path_ba` and `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`.
3. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list of tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for `i` values `1, 3, 5, ..., (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`.

### Analysis:

- **Case 1: Length of `path_ba` is odd**
  - `c` is the middle vertex of `path_ba`.
  - `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`.
  - `ops` will contain tuples `(c, i)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`.

- **Case 2: Length of `path_ba` is even**
  - `c1` and `c2` are the two middle vertices of `path_ba`.
  - `ops` will contain tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for `i` values `1, 3, 5, ..., (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement uses `map` to apply a lambda function to each tuple in `ops`. The lambda function formats each tuple `(x[0], x[1])` as `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`, and `sep='\n'` ensures that each formatted string is printed on a new line.

### Output Description:
- If `path_ba` is odd-length, the output will be a series of lines where each line is formatted as `c+1 i` for `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`.
- If `path_ba` is even-length, the output will be a series of lines where each line is formatted as `c1+1 i` and `c2+1 i` for `i` values `1, 3, 5, ..., (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`.

### Final Output:
Since we do not have the exact values of `path_ba`, `c`, `ci`, `c1`, `c2`, we will describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **c+1 0\nc+1 1\nc+1 2\n...\nc+1 ci (if path_ba is odd-length)\nc1+1 1\nc2+1 1\nc1+1 3\nc2+1 3\nc1+1 5\nc2+1 5\n...\nc1+1 (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)\nc2+1 (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1) (if path_ba is even-length)**

This description captures the format and structure of the output based on the given conditions.
