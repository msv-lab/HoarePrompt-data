The code snippet provided initializes a list named `path_ba` with a single element, which is the value of the variable `b`. This does not affect the values of `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, or `b` directly. The only change is the creation of the new list `path_ba`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as returned by `bfs(a)`; `previous` is the list of previous vertices in the shortest path as returned by `bfs(a)`; `a` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`; `b` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.**
