Let's analyze the given code snippet:

The loop runs `n - 1` times, where `n` is the number of vertices in a tree. During each iteration, the code reads a pair of integers `u` and `v` from the input, representing an edge between vertices `u` and `v` in the tree. The vertices are 1-indexed in the input, so the code converts them to 0-indexed by subtracting 1 from each. It then appends `v` to the list at index `u` and `u` to the list at index `v` in the list `u2vs`.

Since `u2vs` is initially a list of `n` empty lists, after the loop, `u2vs` will contain the adjacency list representation of the tree. Each list at index `i` in `u2vs` will contain the list of vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i`.

Given that the tree has `n` vertices and `n - 1` edges, after the loop, `u2vs` will be a complete adjacency list representation of the tree.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree.**
