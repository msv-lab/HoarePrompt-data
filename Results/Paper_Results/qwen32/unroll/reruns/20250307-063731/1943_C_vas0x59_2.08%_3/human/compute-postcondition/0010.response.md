Let's analyze the provided loop and determine the final state.

### Loop Analysis:

The loop is as follows:
```python
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)
```

- `path_ba` is initialized with a single element `b`.
- In each iteration, `n` is set to the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`.
- If `n` is `-1`, the loop breaks.
- Otherwise, `n` is appended to `path_ba`.

### Understanding `previous`:

The `previous` list is generated by a BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm, which tracks the shortest path from the source vertex (vertex `0`) to all other vertices. Each entry `previous[i]` contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `i`. If there is no path (which would only be the case for the source vertex itself in a connected graph), it is set to `-1`.

### Loop Execution:

1. **Initialization**: `path_ba` starts with `[b]`.
2. **First Iteration**: 
   - `n = previous[path_ba[-1]] = previous[b]` (the previous vertex to `b` in the shortest path from `0`).
   - If `n` is not `-1`, `n` is appended to `path_ba`, making `path_ba = [b, n]`.
3. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - `n = previous[path_ba[-1]]` (the previous vertex to the last element in `path_ba`).
   - This process continues until `n` is `-1`, which means we have reached the source vertex `0` (since `previous[0]` would be `-1`).

### Final State:

After the loop finishes, `path_ba` will contain the shortest path from vertex `b` back to vertex `0` in reverse order. The loop terminates when the source vertex `0` is reached (since `previous[0]` is `-1`).

### Output State:

The final state of `path_ba` will be a list containing the vertices from `b` to `0` in reverse order.

**Output State: **path_ba is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `0` in reverse order, including both `b` and `0`.**

In natural language: The final state is that `path_ba` contains the sequence of vertices starting from `b` and ending at `0`, representing the shortest path from `b` to `0` in reverse order.
