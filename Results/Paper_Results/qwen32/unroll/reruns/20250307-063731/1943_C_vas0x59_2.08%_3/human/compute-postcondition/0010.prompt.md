Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as returned by `bfs(a)`; `previous` is the list of previous vertices in the shortest path as returned by `bfs(a)`; `a` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`; `b` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
