Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `0` in reverse order, including both `b` and `0`; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2; `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**

In simple terms, the variable `c1` has been assigned the value of `c2 - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
