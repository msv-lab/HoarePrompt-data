Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `0` in reverse order, including both `b` and `0`, and the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ops` is an empty list; `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, which is `(len(path_ba) // 2)`; `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`.**

In natural language: The list `path_ba` remains unchanged, still containing the vertices from `b` to `0` in reverse order with an odd length. The list `ops` remains empty. The variable `ci` remains as the middle index of `path_ba`. The new variable `c` is assigned the value of the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`.
