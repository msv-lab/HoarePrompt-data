Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `0` to all other vertices as returned by `bfs(a)`; `previous` is the list of previous vertices in the shortest path as returned by `bfs(a)`; `a` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`; `b` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`.**

In simpler terms: The state remains the same except for the addition of the variable `b`, which is assigned the same value as `a`, which is the value returned by `func_1(d)`.
