The only variable in the loop head of the provided for loop is `_`, which is a throwaway variable, and `n`, which is the number of iterations the loop will execute. The loop will execute `n - 1` times. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2, because if `n` is 1, `n - 1` would be 0, and the loop would not execute.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `n` must be at least 2**. 

This ensures that the loop will execute `n - 1` times, which is at least 1 iteration.
