The code snippet `u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]` initializes a list `u2vs` with `n` empty lists. This means that each of the `n` vertices in the tree will have an empty list associated with it, representing the adjacent vertices (which are initially none).

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `n` is the input integer representing the number of vertices in the tree such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3.**
