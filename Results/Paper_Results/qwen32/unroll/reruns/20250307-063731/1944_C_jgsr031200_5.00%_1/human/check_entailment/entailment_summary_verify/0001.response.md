Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and deleting them.
- Alice appends her chosen elements to `c`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The score is the MEX of `c`.
- Alice wants to maximize the score, while Bob wants to minimize it.

### Strategy:
- Alice and Bob play optimally.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- Alice will try to add elements in such a way that the MEX is maximized.
- Bob will try to add elements that minimize the MEX.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `arr`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - `nums = c.Counter(arr)`: This creates a counter for the elements in the array, which counts how many times each element appears.

3. **Finding the MEX:**
   - `start = 0`: Initializes the starting point for finding the MEX.
   - `vis = set()`: A set to keep track of visited elements.
   - The while loop runs as long as the current `start` value exists in `nums` (`nums.get(start, 0)`).
     - `vis.add(start)`: Adds the current `start` to the visited set.
     - `nums[start] -= 1`: Decrements the count of the current `start` in `nums`.
     - If `start + 1` exists in `nums` (`nums.get(start + 1, 0)`), it decrements the count of `start + 1` and increments `start`.
     - If `start + 1` does not exist, it prints `start + 1` as the MEX and returns.

### Correctness:
- The logic to find the MEX is correct. The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `arr` by incrementing `start` until it finds a missing integer.
- However, the program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. The key point here is that the order in which elements are added to `c` does not affect the MEX calculation when both players play optimally. This is because the MEX is determined by the presence of integers in the final array `c`, and the optimal strategy for both players ensures that the final array `c` will contain the smallest possible non-negative integers in the most efficient manner.

### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array by using a counter to track the occurrences of each integer and incrementally checking for the smallest missing integer.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `arr` for each test case, which is the desired output. The function summary supports this conclusion by accurately describing the behavior of `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the function summary.
