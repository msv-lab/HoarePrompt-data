The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n` and `n` is the length of `arr`. It processes the list to find the smallest integer `start` such that the sequence starting from `0` cannot be continued by finding consecutive integers in the list. The function prints the integer just before the sequence breaks.
