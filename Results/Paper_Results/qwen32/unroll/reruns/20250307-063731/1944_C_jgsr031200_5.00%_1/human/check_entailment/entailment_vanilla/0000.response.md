Let's break down the reasoning step by step to determine if the given program is correct based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob are playing a game on an array `a`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and deleting them.
- Alice appends her chosen elements to `c`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The score is the MEX of `c`.
- Alice wants to maximize the score, while Bob wants to minimize it.

### Strategy:
- Alice and Bob play optimally.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- Alice will try to add elements in such a way that the MEX is maximized.
- Bob will try to add elements that minimize the MEX.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `arr`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - `nums = c.Counter(arr)`: This creates a counter for the elements in the array, which counts how many times each element appears.

3. **Finding the MEX:**
   - `start = 0`: Initializes the starting point for finding the MEX.
   - `vis = set()`: A set to keep track of visited elements.
   - The while loop runs as long as the current `start` value exists in `nums` (`nums.get(start, 0)`).
     - `vis.add(start)`: Adds the current `start` to the visited set.
     - `nums[start] -= 1`: Decrements the count of the current `start` in `nums`.
     - If `start + 1` exists in `nums` (`nums.get(start + 1, 0)`), it decrements the count of `start + 1` and increments `start`.
     - If `start + 1` does not exist, it prints `start + 1` as the MEX and returns.

### Correctness:
- The logic to find the MEX is correct. The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `arr` by incrementing `start` until it finds a missing integer.
- The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, but due to the nature of the MEX calculation, it is sufficient to determine the MEX of the entire array `arr` since the order of elements does not affect the MEX when considering optimal play.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `arr` for each test case, which is the desired output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
