The code snippet provided initializes a new set named `vis`. This set is initially empty. The other variables (`arr`, `nums`, `start`, and `n`) are not affected by this code snippet and retain their initial values.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`; `nums` is a `Counter` object that contains the count of each unique integer in `arr`; `start` is 0; `vis` is an empty set.**
