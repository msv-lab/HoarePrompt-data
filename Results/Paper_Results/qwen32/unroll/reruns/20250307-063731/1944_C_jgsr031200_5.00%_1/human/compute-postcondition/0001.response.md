The code snippet provided initializes a variable `start` to 0. This does not affect the existing variables `arr` and `nums`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the new variable `start`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`; `nums` is a `Counter` object that contains the count of each unique integer in `arr`; `start` is 0.**
