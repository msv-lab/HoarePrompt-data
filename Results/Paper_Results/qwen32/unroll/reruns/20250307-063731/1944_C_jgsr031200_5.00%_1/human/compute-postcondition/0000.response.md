The given code snippet creates a `Counter` object from the list `arr`. The `Counter` object, `nums`, will hold the count of each unique integer in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`. `nums` is a `Counter` object that contains the count of each unique integer in `arr`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `arr` remains a list of integers where each integer `a_i` is still between 0 and `n-1`, and `n` is still the length of `arr`. Additionally, `nums` is now a `Counter` object that holds the count of each unique integer present in `arr`.
