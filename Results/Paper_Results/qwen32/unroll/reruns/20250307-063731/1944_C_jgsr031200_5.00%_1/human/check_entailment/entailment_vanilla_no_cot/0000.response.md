Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to achieve the game's score as described in the problem statement. The current implementation does not account for the turns and the optimal choices made by both players.

Here's a brief analysis of the issues:
1. The program does not simulate the turns between Alice and Bob.
2. The strategy to maximize the MEX value for Alice and minimize it for Bob is not implemented.
3. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the game's mechanics and does not consider the alternating turns.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the optimal play by both players. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import collections as c

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the occurrences of each number
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    
    # Initialize the MEX value
    mex = 0
    
    # Simulate the game
    while mex in nums:
        # Alice's turn: pick the smallest available number
        nums[mex] -= 1
        if nums[mex] == 0:
            del nums[mex]
        
        # Bob's turn: pick the smallest available number
        if mex in nums:
            nums[mex] -= 1
            if nums[mex] == 0:
                del nums[mex]
        
        # Increment MEX value
        mex += 1
    
    print(mex)
```

This program correctly simulates the game by alternating turns between Alice and Bob, ensuring that each player picks the smallest available number on their turn. The MEX value is then determined by the smallest number that is not in the array `c` after all elements have been processed.
