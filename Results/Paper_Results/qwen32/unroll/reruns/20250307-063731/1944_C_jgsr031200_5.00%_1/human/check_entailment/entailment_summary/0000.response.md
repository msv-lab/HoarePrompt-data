### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by simulating the game between Alice and Bob and determining the optimal final score based on the MEX of the array `c`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Counting Occurrences**: The function `func_1` uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the input array `arr`.

2. **Simulating the Game**: 
   - It initializes `start` to 0, which represents the smallest integer that hasn't been added to `c` yet.
   - It uses a `set` called `vis` to keep track of visited integers.
   - In a loop, it checks if the current `start` integer is present in the array (using the `Counter`).
   - If `start` is present, it is added to `c` (simulated by adding it to `vis`), and its count is decremented.
   - It then checks if the next integer (`start + 1`) is present. If it is, it is also added to `c` (simulated by decrementing its count) and `start` is incremented.
   - If `start + 1` is not present, the loop breaks, and the function prints `start + 1`, which is the MEX of `c`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: 
   - Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning Alice will always try to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it.
   - The strategy implemented in the code implicitly captures this by always trying to add the smallest possible integer to `c` and its consecutive integers, ensuring that the MEX is maximized when Alice plays optimally and Bob minimizes it by not allowing Alice to continue the sequence.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The code correctly identifies the smallest integer that cannot be part of a consecutive sequence starting from 0, which is the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.
   - The use of `Counter` and the loop ensures that the function efficiently finds the MEX without simulating the entire game, which would be computationally expensive.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, assuming optimal play from both Alice and Bob. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
