### Reasoning:

The original assessment suggests that the program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `arr` for each test case, which is the desired output. However, there are some nuances in the problem statement and the program's behavior that need closer examination.

The problem specifies that Alice and Bob take turns playing optimally:
- Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the final array `c`.
- Bob aims to minimize the MEX of the final array `c`.

The given program calculates the MEX of the entire array `arr` without simulating the turns of Alice and Bob. It assumes that the optimal strategy for both players leads to the MEX of the entire array `arr` being the final score. This is a reasonable assumption because the MEX of the final array `c` is not affected by the order of elements if both players play optimally.

However, the annotated code and the original assessment do not explicitly address the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob. They only describe the process of finding the MEX of the array. Let's verify if this assumption holds true:

1. **Counting Elements:**
   - `nums = c.Counter(arr)`: This correctly counts the occurrences of each element in the array.

2. **Finding the MEX:**
   - The while loop runs as long as the current `start` value exists in `nums`.
   - It increments `start` until it finds a missing integer, which is the MEX of the array.

The key point is that the MEX calculation is independent of the order of elements being added to `c` if both players play optimally. Alice can always force the MEX to be as high as possible by choosing elements in a way that maximizes the smallest missing integer, and Bob can minimize it by choosing elements that prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the MEX calculation, the program correctly computes the MEX of the array `arr` for each test case, which is indeed the final score of the game when both players play optimally.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `arr` for each test case, which is the desired output.

Final: **True**
