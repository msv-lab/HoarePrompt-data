You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n` and `n` is the length of `arr`. It processes the list to find the smallest integer `start` such that the sequence starting from `0` cannot be continued by finding consecutive integers in the list. The function prints the integer just before the sequence breaks.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively. Here's why:

1. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**:
   - The strategy in the code simply iterates through the numbers starting from 0 and adds them to the set `vis` if they are present in `arr`. It then checks for the next number and removes it from `arr` if it exists. This approach does not take into account the turns between Alice and Bob or the fact that they are playing optimally.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she should try to delay the appearance of smaller numbers as long as possible. Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he should try to force smaller numbers to appear as early as possible.
   - The current code does not simulate the turns or the optimal choices made by Alice and Bob.

2. **Example of Incorrectness**:
   - Consider the test case `n = 4` with `arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]`. The optimal game for Alice and Bob should result in a MEX of 4, as both players will try to delay the appearance of the numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3. However, the current code will output `1` for this case, which is incorrect.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game turns and consider the optimal choices for both players. One possible approach is to count the occurrences of each number in `arr` and then simulate the game by alternating turns between Alice and Bob, always making the optimal choice based on the remaining numbers.

Here is a corrected version of the code that simulates the game correctly:

```python
import collections as c

def mex_of_c(c):
    i = 0
    while i in c:
        i += 1
    return i

def game_score(arr):
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    mex = 0
    turn = 0  # 0 for Alice, 1 for Bob
    while sum(nums.values()) > 0:
        if turn == 0:  # Alice's turn
            # Alice tries to maximize MEX
            while mex in nums and nums[mex] > 0:
                nums[mex] -= 1
                mex += 1
        else:  # Bob's turn
            # Bob tries to minimize MEX
            min_val = min([k for k in nums if nums[k] > 0])
            nums[min_val] -= 1
        turn = 1 - turn
    return mex

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(game_score(arr))
```

This code correctly simulates the game turns and ensures that both players play optimally.
