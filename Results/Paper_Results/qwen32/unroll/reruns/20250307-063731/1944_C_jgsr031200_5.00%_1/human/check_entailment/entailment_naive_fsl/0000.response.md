Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively. Here's why:

1. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**:
   - The strategy in the code simply iterates through the numbers starting from 0 and adds them to the set `vis` if they are present in `arr`. It then checks for the next number and removes it from `arr` if it exists. This approach does not take into account the turns between Alice and Bob or the fact that they are playing optimally.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she should try to delay the appearance of smaller numbers as long as possible. Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he should try to force smaller numbers to appear as early as possible.
   - The current code does not simulate the turns or the optimal choices made by Alice and Bob.

2. **Example of Incorrectness**:
   - Consider the test case `n = 4` with `arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]`. The optimal game for Alice and Bob should result in a MEX of 4, as both players will try to delay the appearance of the numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3. However, the current code will output `1` for this case, which is incorrect.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game turns and consider the optimal choices for both players. One possible approach is to count the occurrences of each number in `arr` and then simulate the game by alternating turns between Alice and Bob, always making the optimal choice based on the remaining numbers.

Here is a corrected version of the code that simulates the game correctly:

```python
import collections as c

def mex_of_c(c):
    i = 0
    while i in c:
        i += 1
    return i

def game_score(arr):
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    mex = 0
    turn = 0  # 0 for Alice, 1 for Bob
    while sum(nums.values()) > 0:
        if turn == 0:  # Alice's turn
            # Alice tries to maximize MEX
            while mex in nums and nums[mex] > 0:
                nums[mex] -= 1
                mex += 1
        else:  # Bob's turn
            # Bob tries to minimize MEX
            min_val = min([k for k in nums if nums[k] > 0])
            nums[min_val] -= 1
        turn = 1 - turn
    return mex

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(game_score(arr))
```

This code correctly simulates the game turns and ensures that both players play optimally.
