The given print statement is:

```python
print('! -1', flush=True)
```

The string `'! -1'` is explicitly provided in the print statement. The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately flushed to the console, but it does not affect the content of the output string.

Based on the initial state provided, none of the variables `n`, `k`, `v`, `cnt`, `l`, or `i` are used in the print statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output.

The print statement will output the exact string `'! -1'`.

Output: **! -1**
