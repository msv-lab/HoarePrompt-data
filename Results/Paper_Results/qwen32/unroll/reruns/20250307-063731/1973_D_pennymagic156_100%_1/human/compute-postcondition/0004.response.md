To determine the necessary state adjustments for the provided for loop to execute, we need to consider the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and `k`. The variable `v` is mentioned in the state description but is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Analysis:
1. **`n`**: `n` is a positive integer, which is already stated. This variable is part of the range calculation (`n // k + 1`), and since `n` is positive, it does not need further adjustment for the loop to execute.
2. **`k`**: `k` is a positive integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, which is already stated. This variable is also part of the range calculation, and since `k` is within the specified range, it does not need further adjustment for the loop to execute.
3. **`i`**: The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be automatically initialized to 1 at the start of the loop. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.

### Conclusion:
The provided state already ensures that the loop can execute as `n` and `k` are correctly defined within the required constraints. The variable `v` is not relevant to the loop's execution and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `v` is the value returned by func_2() in the last iteration**
