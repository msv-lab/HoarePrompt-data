### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays where each subarray's `f(l, r) = m`.
   - `f(l, r) = (r - l + 1) * max(a[l], a[l+1], ..., a[r])`.
   - We can ask up to `2n` queries to find this value `m`.

2. **Function Breakdown:**
   - `func_1`: Reads a line of input and returns a list of integers.
   - `func_2`: Reads a single integer from input.
   - `func_3`: Reads a line of input and returns a map object containing two integers.
   - `func_4`: Reads a line of input and returns it stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `func_5`: This is the main function that implements the logic to solve the problem.

3. **Details of `func_5`:**
   - It first reads `n` and `k` using `func_3`.
   - It then tries to find the maximum possible value of `m` by querying from the start of the array (`l=1`) with different values of `x = i * n` for `i` from `n` down to `1`. This is done to find the maximum possible value of `m` that could satisfy `f(1, r) = m`.
   - If a valid `m` is found (i.e., `v == n`), it breaks out of the loop and assigns `v = i`.
   - It then tries to split the array into `k` parts with each part having `f(l, r) = i * v`.
   - If successful, it prints `! i * v` and returns.
   - If not, it prints `! -1` and returns.

### Analysis:
- The approach of starting with `x = i * n` and decrementing `i` is a reasonable strategy to find the maximum possible `m` because `m` cannot exceed `n * max(a)`, and `max(a)` is at most `n`.
- The loop that attempts to split the array into `k` parts with each part having `f(l, r) = i * v` ensures that we are trying to find a valid split.
- The use of `flush=True` in print statements ensures that the output is sent to the standard output immediately, which is necessary for interactive problems.

### Conclusion:
The provided code seems to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. It uses an appropriate strategy to find the maximum possible `m` and verifies if it can split the array into `k` parts with each part having `f(l, r) = m`.

**Correctness: True**
