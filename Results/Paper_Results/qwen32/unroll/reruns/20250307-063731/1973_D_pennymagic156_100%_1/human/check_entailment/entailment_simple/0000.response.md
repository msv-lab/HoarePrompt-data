### Reasoning:

The program is designed to interactively determine the largest value \( m \) such that the hidden array can be split into exactly \( k \) subarrays where each subarray satisfies \( f(l, r) = m \).

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Finding the Maximum Possible Value \( v \):**
   - The program iterates from \( n \) down to 1 and queries the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(1, r) = i \cdot n \).
   - If \( r = n \), it implies that the maximum possible value for \( m \) is \( i \cdot n \) because the entire array satisfies this condition.

3. **Checking for Valid Split:**
   - For each possible value of \( m \) from \( i \cdot n \) down to \( i \cdot v \), the program checks if the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays such that each subarray has \( f(l, r) = m \).
   - It does this by making queries for each subarray starting from the beginning of the array and checking if the required \( f(l, r) \) can be achieved.
   - If it successfully splits the array into \( k \) subarrays with the required \( f(l, r) = m \), it prints the value of \( m \) and moves to the next test case.
   - If it fails to find such a split, it prints \(-1\).

### Evaluation:

- The program correctly handles the input reading and the logic for finding the maximum possible value \( m \) by iteratively querying the smallest \( r \) for different values of \( i \cdot n \).
- It then checks if the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays with the required \( f(l, r) = m \) by making appropriate queries.
- If the split is possible, it correctly prints the value of \( m \); otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided logic and the interaction with the hidden array, the program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: **True**
