You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

Fox gave Cat two positive integers n and k . She has a hidden array a_1,
\ldots , a_n of length n , such that 1 \leq a_i \leq n for every i . Now they
are going to play the following game:

For any two integers l, r such that 1 \leq l \leq r \leq n , define f(l, r) =
(r - l + 1) \cdot \max\limits_{x=l}^r a_x . In other words, f(l, r) is equal
to the maximum of the subarray a_l, \ldots, a_r multiplied by its size.

Cat can ask Fox at most 2 n questions about the array. He will tell her two
integers l and x (1 \leq l \leq n, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ), and she will tell him
one integer p as the answer — the smallest positive integer r such that f(l,
r) = x , or n+1 if no such r exists.

Now, Cat needs to find the largest value m such that there exists a sequence
c_1, \ldots, c_{k-1} such that 1 \leq c_1 < \ldots < c_{k-1} < n and f(1, c_1)
= f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = \ldots = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m . If no such m exists, he
should indicate this and take -1 as the answer. Note that for k = 1 , m is
always equal to f(1, n) .

In other words, the goal is to find the largest m such that you can split the
array into exactly k subarrays (k is the constant given to you in the
beginning of the interaction) so that all the subarrays have the product of
their length and their maximum equal to m , or determine that no such m
exists. Every element should belong in exactly one of the subarrays.

Cat doesn't know what he should do, so he asked you to play the game for him.

Interaction

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1
\leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 ) — the length of the hidden array and the number of
subarrays in the desired split.

Now you are allowed to make queries in the following way — print one line of
the form "\mathtt{?} \ l \ x " (it must hold that 1 \leq l \leq n , 1 \leq x
\leq 10^9 ) and you will receive the smallest integer r such that l \leq r
\leq n and f(l, r) = x , or n + 1 if no such r exists.

If you want to print the answer, output "\mathtt{!} \ m " and you will recieve
1 if your answer is correct and -1 otherwise. In the first case, the
interaction continues with the next test case. Note that printing the answer
doesn't count towards the number of queries made. Please note that you don't
receive the values for the next test case immediately, you will first have to
read whether your answer to the last test case was correct.

If you receive the integer -1 at any moment, it means your program has made an
invalid query, exceeded the query limit, or gave an incorrect answer. Your
program must terminate immediately to receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query, do not forget to output end of line and flush the
output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the total sum of n over the test cases won't exceed 10^4
.

Hacks

The format of the hacks should be the following: the first line should contain
one integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases should follow.

The first line of each test case should contain two integers n and k (1 \leq k
\leq n \leq 10^4 ) — the length of the array a and the number of subarrays you
want to split it into.

The second line should contain n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \leq a_i
\leq n ).

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Note

The hidden arrays in the three testcases are [1] , [1, 2] and [1, 3, 6, 1, 2,
1] . In the second testcase, no split satisfies the constraints, so the answer
is -1 .

The answer for the first query of the third testcase is 7 since no valid r
exists. For the second query of the third testcase, since 2 \cdot \max(1, 3) =
6 , we will get 2 as the answer, since r = 1 doesn't satisfy the constraint.

The sample interaction guessed all three answers (1, -1 and 6 ) correctly, so
it received 1 after each answer.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` performs a series of queries to determine a specific value based on the input parameters `n` and `k`, which are obtained from `func_3`. It then uses another function `func_2` to process the results of these queries. If a valid value is found that satisfies certain conditions, it prints this value. If no such value is found, it prints `-1`. The function itself does not return any value (None).+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the largest value \( m \) such that the array can be split into exactly \( k \) subarrays where each subarray has the product of its length and its maximum equal to \( m \).

Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Approach to Finding \( m \)**:
   - The code attempts to find the largest \( m \) by querying the maximum possible value of \( i \cdot n \) and then checking if it can split the array into \( k \) subarrays with the same \( f(l, r) \) value. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider all possible values of \( m \) and does not handle the interaction correctly to find the exact largest \( m \).

2. **Binary Search for \( m \)**:
   - The problem requires using a binary search approach to find the largest \( m \) efficiently. The provided code does not implement binary search and instead uses a linear approach which is not optimal and may not cover all cases.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the array cannot be split into \( k \) subarrays with the same \( f(l, r) \) value. It only checks a limited set of values and does not ensure that it can find the correct largest \( m \) for all possible inputs.

4. **Query Limit**:
   - The code does not ensure that it does not exceed the query limit of \( 2n \) queries per test case. It makes a large number of queries without considering the efficiency of its approach.

### Example of a Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 2
1 2 3 4
```

The correct answer is `4` because the array can be split into two subarrays `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4]` where `f(1, 3) = 3 * 3 = 9` and `f(4, 4) = 1 * 4 = 4`, but the largest \( m \) that can be achieved by splitting the array into two subarrays is `4` (e.g., `[1, 2]` and `[3, 4]` where `f(1, 2) = 2 * 2 = 4` and `f(3, 4) = 2 * 4 = 8`).

The provided code would likely not find `4` as the correct answer because it does not implement the correct logic to find the largest \( m \) efficiently and correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to find the largest \( m \) for all possible test cases and does not handle the interaction efficiently.
