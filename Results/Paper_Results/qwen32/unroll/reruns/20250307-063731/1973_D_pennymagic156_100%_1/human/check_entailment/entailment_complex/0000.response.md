### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by making queries to the hidden array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of its logic:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - For each test case, `func_5` is called.
   - `n` and `k` are read using `func_3`.

2. **Finding the Largest Possible Value**:
   - The code starts by trying to find the largest possible value `v` such that `f(1, n) = v * n` exists. This is done by making queries of the form `? 1 {i * n}` for `i` from `n` down to `1`.
   - If a query returns `n`, it means `f(1, n) = i * n` is valid, and `v` is set to `i`. The loop breaks once such a `v` is found.

3. **Checking for a Valid Split**:
   - Once `v` is determined, the code checks if it is possible to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray has the value `i * v`.
   - It does this by making queries of the form `? {l} {i * v}` for each subarray.
   - If the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the desired value, it prints `! {i * v}` and terminates.
   - If no such split is possible, it prints `! -1`.

### Analysis:

- **Finding `v`**:
  - The approach to find `v` is logical. By starting from the largest possible value and moving downwards, the first valid `v` found is the largest possible value for `f(1, n)`.
  - This ensures that the code is trying to maximize `m` from the start.

- **Checking for a Valid Split**:
  - The code attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays with the value `i * v` by making queries.
  - It ensures that each subarray has the same value `i * v` by querying the array from the start and moving forward.
  - If the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the desired value, it correctly prints the result.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code handles the case where no valid split is possible by printing `! -1`.
  - The code also handles the case where `k = 1` by directly using `f(1, n)`.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the largest `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the value `m`. It makes the necessary queries and checks for valid splits. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.
