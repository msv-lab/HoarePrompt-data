The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and the step `-1`. According to the loop statement, the loop will start with `i` initialized to `n` and will decrement `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` is no longer greater than 0. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 because the range function will generate values from `n` down to 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n.
- `v` is 1.

The state of `k` and `v` does not affect the execution of the loop. The loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer, which is already given. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n` to ensure the loop executes. 

However, to align with the requirement to specify the state of all objects in the loop head, we can explicitly state that `i` is initialized to `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is initialized to `n`**
