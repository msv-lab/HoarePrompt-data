To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the provided code:

The loop iterates from `1` to `n // k + 1`. In each iteration, it initializes `cnt` to `k` and `l` to `1`. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as `cnt` is greater than `0` and `l` is less than `n + 1`. Inside the while loop, it prints a query with `l` and `i * v`, then updates `l` based on the result of `func_2()`, and decrements `cnt`. If after the while loop `cnt` is `0` and `l` is `n + 1`, it prints the result `i * v` and calls `func_2()` before returning.

The loop will terminate when the condition `cnt == 0 and l == n + 1` is met, and the function will return after printing the result. This implies that the loop will find a value of `i * v` such that the sequence of `l` values generated by `func_2()` will cover all values from `1` to `n`, and `cnt` will be decremented to `0`.

Given that the loop returns after finding such a value, the state of `n`, `k`, and `v` will remain unchanged from the initial state. The variables `cnt`, `l`, `i`, and the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration will be the final values in the output state.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, v is the value returned by func_2() in the last iteration, cnt is 0, l is n + 1, and i is the value that caused the loop to terminate.**
