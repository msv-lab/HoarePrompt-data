Functionality: **The function `func_5` performs a series of queries to determine a specific value based on the input parameters `n` and `k`, which are obtained from `func_3`. It then uses another function `func_2` to process the results of these queries. If a valid value is found that satisfies certain conditions, it prints this value. If no such value is found, it prints `-1`. The function itself does not return any value (None).**
