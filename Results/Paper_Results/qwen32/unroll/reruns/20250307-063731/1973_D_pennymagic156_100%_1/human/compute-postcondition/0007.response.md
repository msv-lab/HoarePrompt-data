The code snippet provided is simply a call to the function `func_2()`. This function call will execute the code inside `func_2()`, but the provided initial state does not specify what `func_2()` does. Therefore, we can only assume that `func_2()` will return a value, which we will denote as `v`.

Since the initial state mentions that `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, after calling `func_2()` again, `v` will be updated to the new return value of `func_2()`. No other variables are affected by this function call based on the information provided.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `cnt`, `l`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the function call `func_2()`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in this iteration, `cnt` is 0, `l` is n + 1, and `i` is the value that caused the loop to terminate.**
