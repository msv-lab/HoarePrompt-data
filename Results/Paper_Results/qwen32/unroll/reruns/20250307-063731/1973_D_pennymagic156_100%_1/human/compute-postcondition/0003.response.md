To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the function `func_2()`. The loop iterates from `n` down to `1`, and in each iteration, it prints a query and then assigns the result of `func_2()` to `v`. If `v` equals `n`, it sets `v` to the current loop index `i` and breaks out of the loop.

Given the loop's behavior, there are two possible scenarios:
1. If `func_2()` returns `n` at some point during the loop, the loop will break, and `v` will be set to the current loop index `i`.
2. If `func_2()` never returns `n` during the loop, the loop will complete all iterations, and `v` will retain the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration (which is `n` in the initial state but could be any value returned by `func_2()`).

However, since the problem does not provide the definition of `func_2()`, we assume the worst-case scenario where `func_2()` never returns `n`, and the loop completes all iterations. In this case, the final value of `v` will be the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, which is not specified. But since we need to adhere to the format and the information given, we assume `v` retains its last assigned value, which is not `n` in this case.

Given the initial state and the loop's behavior, the output state after all iterations will be:

Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, v is the value returned by func_2() in the last iteration.**

Since the exact value of `v` in the last iteration is not specified, and assuming `func_2()` did not return `n` at any point, we can say `v` retains its last value, which is not `n`.

For the sake of providing a concrete example, if we assume `func_2()` consistently returns a value other than `n` (let's say it returns `1` for simplicity), then the output state would be:

Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, v is 1.**

However, without the exact behavior of `func_2()`, the most accurate response based on the given information is:

Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, v is the value returned by func_2() in the last iteration.**

Since the problem asks for a specific format and the exact value of `v` is not provided, we can assume the loop completes without breaking and `v` retains its last value, which we can denote as `v` (the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration).

Thus, the final answer is:

Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, v is the value returned by func_2() in the last iteration.**
