The value of `v` is assigned the value `1`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are the values returned by `func_3()` and are still valid after the code execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and `v` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `v` is 1**.
