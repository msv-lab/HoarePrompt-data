The code snippet `n, k = func_3()` indicates that the values of `n` and `k` are being reassigned based on the return values of the function `func_3()`. Since the specific implementation of `func_3()` is not provided, we can only infer that `n` and `k` will be updated to whatever values `func_3()` returns. The initial conditions about `n` and `k` (that `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the hidden array, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n) should still hold after the function call, assuming `func_3()` adheres to these constraints.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n.**
