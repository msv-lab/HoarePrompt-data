You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when the Kraken's attacks are insufficient to sink any ship or when the number of attacks is very large. Let's analyze a specific case where the code fails:

Consider the following test case:

```
1
5 20
2 7 1 8 2
```

According to the problem statement, the Kraken will attack the ships in the following order: first, last, first, last, and so on. The durability of the ships is [2, 7, 1, 8, 2]. The Kraken attacks 20 times. 

Let's simulate the process:

1. Attack the first ship (durability 2) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 2] -> 1 ship sunk
2. Attack the last ship (durability 2) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 0] -> 2 ships sunk
3. Attack the first ship (durability 0, already sunk) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]
4. Attack the last ship (durability 0, already sunk) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]
5. Attack the first ship (durability 0, already sunk) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]
6. Attack the last ship (durability 0, already sunk) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]
7. Attack the first ship (durability 0, already sunk) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]
8. Attack the last ship (durability 0, already sunk) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]
9. Attack the first ship (durability 0, already sunk) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]
10. Attack the last ship (durability 0, already sunk) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]
11. Attack the first ship (durability 0, already sunk) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]
12. Attack the last ship (durability 0, already sunk) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]
13. Attack the first ship (durability 0, already sunk) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]
14. Attack the last ship (durability 0, already sunk) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]
15. Attack the first ship (durability 0, already sunk) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]
16. Attack the last ship (durability 0, already sunk) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]
17. Attack the first ship (durability 0, already sunk) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]
18. Attack the last ship (durability 0, already sunk) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]
19. Attack the first ship (durability 0, already sunk) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]
20. Attack the last ship (durability 0, already sunk) -> [0, 7, 1, 8, 0]

In this case, the Kraken should sink 2 ships, but the provided code will not correctly handle this scenario due to incorrect logic in the loop and the handling of `k`. Specifically, the code does not correctly account for the scenario where `k` is large and many attacks are made on already sunk ships.

Thus, the code is incorrect for this test case, and the Correctness is **False**.
