You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves simulating a series of attacks on a list of ships with varying durability. The Kraken alternates attacks between the first and last ships in the list until it has performed `k` attacks or all ships have sunk. The task is to determine how many ships have sunk after `k` attacks.

### Program Analysis:
The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the number of ships `n`, the number of attacks `k`, and a list of ship durabilities `a`. It uses a two-pointer technique (`l` and `r`) to track the first and last ships in the list. The function attempts to simulate the attacks and count the number of ships that sink.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `l` (left pointer) is initialized to 0 (the first ship).
   - `r` (right pointer) is initialized to `n - 1` (the last ship).
   - `sunks` is initialized to 0 to count the number of sunk ships.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `k` is greater than 0.

3. **Single Ship Case**:
   - If `l` equals `r`, it means there's only one ship left. If `k` is at least the durability of this ship, it sinks, and the loop breaks.

4. **Attacking the First Ship**:
   - If the durability of the first ship (`a[l]`) is less than or equal to the durability of the last ship (`a[r]`):
     - If `k` is at least twice the durability of the first ship, it attacks the first ship twice (once reducing its durability to 0 and sinking it, and once attacking the last ship). It then adjusts the durability of the last ship and updates the pointers and counters accordingly.
     - If `k` is exactly `2 * a[l] - 1`, it attacks the first ship once, sinking it, and the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, it breaks the loop (indicating that there aren't enough attacks left to sink the first ship).

5. **Attacking the Last Ship**:
   - If the durability of the last ship (`a[r]`) is less than the durability of the first ship (`a[l]`):
     - If `k` is at least twice the durability of the last ship, it attacks the last ship twice (once reducing its durability to 0 and sinking it, and once attacking the first ship). It then adjusts the durability of the first ship and updates the pointers and counters accordingly.
     - If `k` is exactly `2 * a[r] - 1`, it attacks the last ship once, sinking it, and the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, it breaks the loop (indicating that there aren't enough attacks left to sink the last ship).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where `k` is very large (up to \(10^{15}\)) efficiently, as it attempts to simulate each attack individually.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Inefficiency for Large `k`**: The program attempts to simulate each attack individually, which is inefficient for large values of `k` (up to \(10^{15}\)).
- **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle cases where `k` is exactly enough to sink a ship but not enough to attack the other ship again.
- **Logical Errors**: The program incorrectly breaks out of the loop in some cases where it should continue simulating attacks.

### Correctness:
Given the inefficiency and logical errors in handling large values of `k` and edge cases, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
