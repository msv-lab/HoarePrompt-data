The `while` loop condition is `l <= r`, which means the loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Given the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `sunks` is 0.

The variables `l` and `r` are the only ones that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. 

Currently, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. Since `r` is defined as `n - 1`, and `n` is at least 1 (as per the constraints), `r` will always be at least 0. Therefore, `l` (which is 0) will always be less than or equal to `r`.

Thus, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 0**
