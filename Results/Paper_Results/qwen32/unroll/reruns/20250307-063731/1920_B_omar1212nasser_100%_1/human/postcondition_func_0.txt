The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list of `n` positive integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum possible sum of the list after allowing Alice to remove up to `k` elements and Bob to multiply up to `x` elements by -1.
