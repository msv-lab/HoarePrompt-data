### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic and see if the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This helps in easily identifying the smallest and largest elements, which is crucial for both Alice and Bob's optimal moves.

2. **Alice's Move**: Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array. Therefore, she should remove the smallest `k` elements from the array. This is because removing smaller elements will leave the larger elements in the array, thus maximizing the sum.

3. **Bob's Move**: After Alice's move, Bob wants to minimize the sum of the array. He can do this by multiplying up to `x` elements by -1. The optimal strategy for Bob is to flip the signs of the smallest elements in the remaining array because flipping smaller elements will have a more significant impact on reducing the sum.

4. **Calculating the Sum**:
   - Initially, the sum of the array is calculated.
   - The function `func_2` calculates the sum after Alice removes `i` elements (where `i` ranges from 0 to `k`). It also calculates the sum after Bob flips the signs of `negatives` elements.
   - `s` is the sum of the array after removing the last `removals` elements.
   - `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the array after the loop, considering the conditional additions and subtractions.
   - The function then computes the possible sums after each combination of removals and flips, and returns the maximum of these sums.

5. **Maximizing the Result**: The function `func_2` calculates the sum for each possible number of removals by Alice and flips by Bob, and returns the maximum possible sum after both players have made their optimal moves.

Given the above logic, the program correctly calculates the maximum sum after both players have made their optimal moves.
