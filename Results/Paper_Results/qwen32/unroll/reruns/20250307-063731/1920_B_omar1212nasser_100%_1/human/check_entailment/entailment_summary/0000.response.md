Let's analyze the provided code and its functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Alice's Move**: Alice can remove up to `k` elements from the array.
2. **Bob's Move**: Bob can multiply up to `x` elements by `-1`.
3. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of the array after both players play optimally.

### Analysis of the Code

#### Function `func_1()`

- **Purpose**: This function handles the input reading and output generation for multiple test cases.
- **Process**:
  - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the list of `n` integers.
  - Sorts the list of integers.
  - Calls `func_2()` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted list.
  - Prints the result from `func_2()`.

#### Function `func_2(removals, negatives, elements)`

- **Purpose**: This function calculates the maximum possible sum after Alice and Bob's moves.
- **Process**:
  - Initializes an empty list `pos` to store possible sums.
  - Computes the initial sum `s` of all elements.
  - Computes the sum `s2` of the last `negatives` elements.
  - Appends the first possible sum to `pos`: `s - 2 * s2`.
  - Iteratively removes elements from the end of the list (i.e., the largest elements) and updates `s` and `s2` accordingly.
  - For each iteration, it calculates the new sum after Alice's removal and Bob's optimal negation and appends it to `pos`.
  - Returns the maximum value from `pos`.

### Correctness Evaluation

1. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to facilitate optimal removal by Alice (removing the largest elements) and optimal negation by Bob (negating the smallest remaining elements).
2. **Iterative Calculation**: The function iterates through the possibilities of removing up to `k` elements and calculates the maximum possible sum considering Bob's negation of up to `x` elements.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function handles cases where `k` or `x` could be equal to `n`, meaning Alice could remove all elements or Bob could negate all elements.

### Conclusion

The provided functions correctly implement the logic to determine the optimal sum of the array after both players play optimally. The sorting and iterative calculation ensure that both Alice's and Bob's moves are considered optimally.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
