### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the optimal sum of an array after Alice and Bob play their respective moves. Alice can remove up to `k` elements from the array, and Bob can multiply up to `x` elements by `-1`. The goal is to find the maximum possible sum after these operations, assuming both players play optimally.

Let's break down the provided functions and their logic:

#### `func_1()`:
- **Input Handling**: Reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
- **Parameters**: For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `x` and the array `a`.
- **Sorting**: Sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
- **Function Call**: Calls `func_2()` with `k`, `x`, and the sorted array `a`.
- **Output**: Prints the result returned by `func_2()`.

#### `func_2(removals, negatives, elements)`:
- **Initialization**: 
  - `pos` is initialized as an empty list.
  - `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements`.
  - `pos` is appended with `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`. This represents the scenario where no elements are removed by Alice, and Bob inverts the last `negatives` elements.
- **Loop**:
  - Iterates from `1` to `removals` (inclusive).
  - In each iteration:
    - `s` is updated by subtracting the last element in `elements` (since elements are sorted, this means removing the largest element in the remaining array).
    - `s2` is updated by subtracting the last element in `elements`.
    - If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is updated by adding the element at the position `-(negatives + i)`.
    - `pos` is appended with `s - 2 * s2`.
- **Return**: Returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

### Analysis:
- **Sorting**: Sorting the array in ascending order helps in making optimal choices for removal and inversion.
- **Logic in `func_2`**:
  - The function calculates the sum of the array after different scenarios of removals and inversions.
  - It iteratively removes the largest elements (since removing larger elements maximizes the sum for Alice) and considers different scenarios of inverting the last `negatives` elements.
  - The list `pos` stores the sum of the array in different scenarios, and the maximum value in `pos` is returned.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic for finding the optimal sum after both players play optimally. The sorting step helps in making the best choices for removal and inversion, and the iterative approach in `func_2` considers all possible scenarios.

**Correctness: True**
