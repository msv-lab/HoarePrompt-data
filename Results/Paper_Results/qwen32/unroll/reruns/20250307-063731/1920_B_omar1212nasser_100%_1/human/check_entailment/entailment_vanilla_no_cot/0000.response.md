Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Here are the main issues:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted in ascending order, but the optimal strategy requires considering the smallest absolute values for removal and the smallest non-negative values for negation.
  
2. **Handling Removals and Negations**: The current implementation does not correctly simulate the optimal removals and negations:
   - Alice should remove the `k` smallest absolute values to maximize the sum.
   - Bob should negate the `x` smallest non-negative values to minimize the sum after Alice's removals.

3. **Negation Logic**: The current logic for negation is incorrect and does not consider the optimal choice of elements to negate.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases where all elements are negative or where `k` or `x` equal `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort(key=abs, reverse=True)  # Sort by absolute value in descending order
        
        # Alice removes k elements
        remaining = a[k:]
        
        # Bob negates x elements
        for i in range(min(x, len(remaining))):
            if remaining[i] > 0:
                remaining[i] = -remaining[i]
        
        print(sum(remaining))

# Call the function to process input
func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Sorting**: The array is sorted by absolute value in descending order. This ensures that the smallest absolute values are considered first for removal and the smallest non-negative values are considered first for negation.
2. **Alice's Removal**: Alice removes the `k` smallest absolute values.
3. **Bob's Negation**: Bob negates the `x` smallest non-negative values from the remaining array.
4. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the remaining array is calculated and printed.

This approach ensures that both players play optimally according to the problem statement.
