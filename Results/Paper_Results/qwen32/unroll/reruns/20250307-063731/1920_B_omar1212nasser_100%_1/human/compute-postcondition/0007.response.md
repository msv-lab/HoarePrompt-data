Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and `elements` is a list of integers. The function calculates a value `pos` in each iteration as the difference between the sum of the elements in `elements` after removing the last `removals` elements (`s`) and twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` (`s2`). The function returns the maximum value of `pos` obtained during these calculations.**
