The only object in the loop head is the variable `f` and the iterable `F`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `F` has at least one element for the loop to execute. The states of `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, and `ans` are not directly related to the execution of the loop and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the larger element in the pair that gives the largest difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`, `F` must have at least one element**
