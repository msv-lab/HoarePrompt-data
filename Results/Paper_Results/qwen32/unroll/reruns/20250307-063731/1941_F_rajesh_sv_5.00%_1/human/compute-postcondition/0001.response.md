In the given task, the loop will execute based on the value of `testcases`, which is the return value of the function `func_3()`. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and `testcases`. The underscore `_` is a conventional variable name used when the loop variable is not needed in the loop body, and `testcases` determines the number of iterations.

To ensure that the loop executes, `testcases` must be greater than 0 since the `range(testcases)` will produce an iterable with `testcases` number of elements.

State: **`testcases` holds the return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than 0**
