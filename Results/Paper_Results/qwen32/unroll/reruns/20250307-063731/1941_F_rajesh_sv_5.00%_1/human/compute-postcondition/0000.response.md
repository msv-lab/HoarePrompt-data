The code snippet `testcases = func_3()` indicates that the variable `testcases` is being assigned the return value of the function `func_3()`. Since the initial state does not provide any information about the function `func_3()` or its return value, we can only state that `testcases` will hold whatever value `func_3()` returns.

Output State: **`testcases` holds the return value of `func_3()`**.
