You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 8 : The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It executes a number of times determined by the value returned from `func_3`, calling `func_6` that many times. The function itself does not return any value but performs the action of calling `func_6` multiple times.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly and contains some logical issues. Let's break down the problems:

1. **Function `func_1` and `wrapper`**:
   - `func_1` is defined to return a `wrapper` function, but `d` is a local variable inside `func_1`. This means `d` will be re-initialized every time `func_1` is called, which is not the intended behavior for memoization. Also, `func_1` is never used in the program, making it redundant.

2. **Function `func_6`**:
   - The core logic for finding the minimum imbalance is implemented here. However, there are several issues:
     - The variables `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` are initialized to `-inf`, which is fine for finding the maximum difference, but it might not be the best practice for readability.
     - The logic for finding the `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` is correct, but the binary search part has a flaw. The binary search is used to find the position where the new problem can be inserted to minimize the imbalance, but the logic to update `ans` is incorrect.
     - The binary search loop condition `while l < h` might not correctly cover all cases. For example, if `l` and `h` are adjacent, the loop might not execute, and the `ans` might not be updated correctly.
     - The final `ans` is compared with `next_max_diff`, but this comparison might not be correct in all cases. The `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference in the original list, and it might not be the correct value to compare with when a new problem is added.

3. **Function `func_7`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_6` for each test case. This part is correct, but it relies on the correctness of `func_6`.

To ensure correctness, we need to carefully handle the binary search and the logic to update `ans`. Here is a potential edge case that the program might fail:

**Edge Case:**
```
1
3 1 1
1 10 100
5
1
```
In this case, the original list is `[1, 10, 100]`, and the only possible new problem complexity is `5 + 1 = 6`. The correct minimum imbalance should be `min(10 - 1, 100 - 6, 6 - 1) = 4`, but the program might not handle this correctly due to the binary search logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
