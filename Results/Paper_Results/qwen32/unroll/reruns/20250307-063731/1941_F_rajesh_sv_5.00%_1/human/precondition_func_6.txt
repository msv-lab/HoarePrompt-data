n, m, and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, and 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5. A is a list of n integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems, sorted in strictly increasing order. D is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models. F is a list of k integers representing the complexities of the functions.
