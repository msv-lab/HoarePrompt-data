To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n):`, which means the loop will iterate over the indices from 1 to `n-1`.

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range starts from 1. The value of `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it will be initialized to 1 by the `range` function.

The other variables mentioned (`m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff` is -inf, `next_max_diff` is -inf, `index` is None**
