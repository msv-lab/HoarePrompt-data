Output State: **`max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the larger element in the pair that gives the largest difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`.**

In this output state, the variable `ans` has been assigned the value of `max_diff`. All other variables retain their initial values as they were not modified by the code snippet.
