The code assigns the value of the element before the `index` in list `A` to `left` and the value of the element at `index` in list `A` to `right`. The values of `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the larger element in the pair that gives the largest difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`.**
