You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

    #The program returns the variable `wrapper`, which is not defined in the given initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `func`, which is expected to be a function. The function attempts to return a variable `wrapper`, but since `wrapper` is not defined within the provided code, this would result in a `NameError`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of arguments that the function `func` can accept. The elements within `args` can be of any type and value, and the function `wrapper` checks if `args` is already a key in the dictionary `d`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function computes and prints the maximum value between the second largest difference between consecutive elements in a sorted list `A` and a computed minimum value `ans`. The computation of `ans` involves finding the optimal adjustment using elements from list `F` and a sorted list `D` to minimize the difference between a specific pair of elements in `A`.

The function itself does not return any value but performs the action of calling `func_6` multiple times.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1(func)`: This function is supposed to define a memoization wrapper, but it's incomplete and incorrect. It doesn't even call `wrapper` properly.
   - `wrapper(*args)`: This is supposed to be a memoization function but is not being used anywhere in the code, and it references `d` which is not defined in its scope.
   - `func_2()`: This reads a line from the standard input and strips it.
   - `func_3()`: This reads an integer from the input.
   - `func_4(delimiter=' ')`: This reads a line from the input, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer.
   - `func_5()`: This reads a line from the input without stripping it.
   - `func_6()`: This is the main function that processes each test case. It reads the number of problems, models, and functions, the complexities of the problems, the complexities of the models, and the complexities of the functions. It then calculates the current maximum imbalance and the second largest imbalance. It uses a binary search to find the optimal position to insert a new problem to minimize the imbalance.
   - `func_7()`: This reads the number of test cases and iterates over each one, calling `func_6()` for each test case.

2. **Logic of `func_6()`**:
   - The function reads the input values.
   - It calculates the current maximum imbalance and the second largest imbalance.
   - It iterates over all possible function complexities `f` and uses binary search to find the best model complexity `d` to minimize the imbalance.
   - It prints the minimum imbalance after considering the insertion of the new problem.

3. **Correctness of `func_6()`**:
   - The function correctly calculates the current maximum imbalance and the second largest imbalance.
   - It uses binary search to find the optimal model complexity `d` for each function complexity `f` to minimize the imbalance.
   - It ensures that the new problem is inserted in such a way that the imbalance is minimized.

4. **Issues**:
   - The memoization functions `func_1` and `wrapper` are not used and are not correctly defined.
   - The function `func_5` is defined but not used.
   - The function `func_2` is defined but not used (since `func_4` already reads and splits the line).

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct in terms of logic and functionality, but it contains a few unused and incorrectly defined functions which do not affect the correctness of the solution. Thus, the core functionality of the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
