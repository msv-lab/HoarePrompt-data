Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, and three lists: `A` (a list of `n` integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems, sorted in strictly increasing order), `D` (a sorted list of `m` unique integers representing the complexities of the models), and `F` (a list of `k` integers representing the complexities of the functions). The function returns the number of problems that can be solved with the available models and functions.**
