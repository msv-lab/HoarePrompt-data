#State of the program right berfore the function call: func is a function.
def func_1(func):

    return wrapper
    #The program returns the variable `wrapper`, which is not defined in the given initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `func`, which is expected to be a function. The function attempts to return a variable `wrapper`, but since `wrapper` is not defined within the provided code, this would result in a `NameError`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of arguments that the function `func` can accept. The elements within `args` can be of any type and value, and the function `wrapper` checks if `args` is already a key in the dictionary `d`. If not, it computes the result of `func(*args)` and stores it in `d` with `args` as the key.
def wrapper():

    #State: `args` is a tuple of arguments that the function `func` can accept, and the elements within `args` can be of any type and value. If `args` was not already a key in the dictionary `d`, then `d` now includes `args` as a key with the value `func(*args)`. Otherwise, `d` remains unchanged. `a` is a list of integers.
    return d[args]
    #The program returns the value associated with the key `args` in the dictionary `d`. This value is the result of `func(*args)` if `args` was not already a key in `d` when the function was called. If `args` was already a key in `d`, it returns the pre-existing value associated with `args`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `wrapper` takes a tuple of arguments `args` and checks if `args` is a key in the dictionary `d`. If `args` is not a key in `d`, it computes the result of `func(*args)`, stores this result in `d` with `args` as the key, and returns the result. If `args` is already a key in `d`, it returns the pre-existing value associated with `args`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of text from standard input, removes any leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the cleaned string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature.
def func_3():

    #The program returns the integer value returned by `func_2()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns the integer value returned by `func_2()`.

    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_2()` using the `delimiter` and converting each split substring into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a `delimiter` string and returns a list of integers by splitting the string returned by `func_2()` using the `delimiter` and converting each split substring into an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters, so there are no variables to describe in terms of preconditions.
def func_5():

    #The program returns the result of the function `func_2()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns the result of the function `func_2()`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, and 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5.

    #This is printed: max(ans, next_max_diff) (where ans is the minimum value found by the loop and next_max_diff is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in list A)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function computes and prints the maximum value between the second largest difference between consecutive elements in a sorted list `A` and a computed minimum value `ans`. The computation of `ans` involves finding the optimal adjustment using elements from list `F` and a sorted list `D` to minimize the difference between a specific pair of elements in `A`.

    #State: `func_6()` has been called `testcases` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It executes a number of times determined by the value returned from `func_3`, calling `func_6` that many times. The function itself does not return any value but performs the action of calling `func_6` multiple times.
