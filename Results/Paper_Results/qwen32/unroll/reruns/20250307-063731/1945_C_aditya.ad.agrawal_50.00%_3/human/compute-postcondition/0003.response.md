The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s. Each character in the string `a` indicates the side of the street the resident of the corresponding house wants to live on, where 0 means the left side and 1 means the right side. The function returns the number of residents who want to live on the left side of the street (i.e., the number of 0s in the string `a`).
