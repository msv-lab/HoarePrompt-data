To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the variable `t`, which is the loop condition. The loop will execute as long as `t` is non-zero.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an input integer.
- `n` is an integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses.
- `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s.

The `while` loop condition is `while t:`, which means the loop will execute if `t` is not zero.

Therefore, to ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5), `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s**.
