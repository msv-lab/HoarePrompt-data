Each test case consists of an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, followed by a string a of length n consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident wants to live on the right side. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
