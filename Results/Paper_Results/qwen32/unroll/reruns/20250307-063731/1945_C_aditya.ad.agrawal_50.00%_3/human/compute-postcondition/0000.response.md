Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, followed by a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, where `a_j` = 0 if the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side of the street, and `a_j` = 1 if the resident wants to live on the right side. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of an input integer. The other variables `n` and `a` remain as described in the initial state, with no changes made to them by the provided code snippet.
