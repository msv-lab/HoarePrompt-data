Functionality: **The function `func_1` determines the winner of a game based on the structure of a tree and the starting node of a stone. It accepts three parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in the tree, a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges in the tree, and an integer `start` representing the starting node of the stone. The function returns 'Ron' if the distance from the starting node to any two leaf nodes is such that at least one of these distances is even, otherwise it returns 'Hermione'.**
