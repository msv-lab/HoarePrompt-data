Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree, where 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n. `tree` is an adjacency list representing the tree structure with n nodes and n-1 edges, and it is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves. `queue` is a deque with the initial element `(start, 0)`.**

In simple terms, the initial state of `start` and `target` as integers within the specified range, and the `tree` structure as an adjacency list with the given properties, remains unchanged. A new variable `queue` is introduced as a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`.
