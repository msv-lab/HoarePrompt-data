n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, edges is a list of (n-1) tuples where each tuple contains two integers (u, v) representing an edge in the tree with 1 <= u, v <= n, and start is an integer representing the starting node of the game such that 1 <= start <= n. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
