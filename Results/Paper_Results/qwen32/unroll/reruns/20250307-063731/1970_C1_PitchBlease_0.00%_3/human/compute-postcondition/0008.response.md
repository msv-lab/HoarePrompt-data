Postcondition: **`tree` is a `defaultdict` where each key is a node (from 1 to n) and each value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to the key node, representing the adjacency list of the tree; `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged; `leaves` is a list of nodes that have exactly one connection in the tree; `dist1` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[0]`; `dist2` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[1]`. Both `dist1` and `dist2` are odd integers.**
