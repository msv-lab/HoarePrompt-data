### Reasoning:

The program provided aims to determine if a given subarray can be split into parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. The program reads multiple test cases, each containing an array and a series of queries. For each query, it checks if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

The approach taken by the program is as follows:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix XOR for the array. The prefix XOR at index `i` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`. This is stored in the `pf` array.

2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**: The program uses a dictionary `mp` to map each prefix XOR value to the list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query defined by `l` and `r`, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XOR values: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` is 0, it means the subarray itself has an XOR of 0, and hence, it can be trivially split into parts with equal XOR (each part being the subarray itself). 

4. **Checking for Valid Splits**: If `x` is not 0, the program checks if there are indices `i` and `j` such that `l <= i < j <= r` and `pf[i] == pf[j]`. This indicates that the subarray from `i` to `j` has an XOR of 0. The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to efficiently find such indices in the list of indices stored in the dictionary `mp`.

5. **Result Compilation**: The program appends "YES" or "NO" to the `results` list based on whether the subarray can be split as required. After processing all queries for a test case, it appends an empty string to `results` to separate the results of different test cases.

6. **Output**: Finally, the program prints all results, with each test case's results separated by an empty line.

The logic and implementation seem correct based on the problem description. The use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures that the program efficiently handles the constraints provided (up to 2 * 10^5 elements and queries per test case).
