Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `a` and `queries` are not yet processed; `idx` is equal to 1 + 2*t + n*q (the index after processing all test cases); `results` is a list containing the answers to all the queries, with each test case's results followed by an empty string.**
