The function processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if there exists a subarray within the specified range that has a bitwise XOR of zero and returns "YES" if such a subarray exists, otherwise "NO". The results for all queries in a test case are printed together, with an empty line separating the results of different test cases.
