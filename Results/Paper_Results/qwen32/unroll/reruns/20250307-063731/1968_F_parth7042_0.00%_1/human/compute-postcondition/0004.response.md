The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the initial state of `t`, `n`, `q`, `data`, `a`, `queries`, and `idx` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `a` and `queries` are not yet processed; `idx` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
