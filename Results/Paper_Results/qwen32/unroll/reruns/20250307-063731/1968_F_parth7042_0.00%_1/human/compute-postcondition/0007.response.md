The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print('\n'.join(results))`. This statement will concatenate all the elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). 

Based on the initial state, `results` is a list that contains the answers to all the queries for each test case, followed by an empty string after each test case's results. Therefore, the output will be a string where each answer to a query is on a new line, and an extra newline separates the results of different test cases.

To provide a precise description, let's break it down:
- `results` contains the answers to the queries for each test case.
- Each test case's results are followed by an empty string, which translates to an extra newline in the output.

Given that we do not have the exact contents of `results`, we can describe the output format as follows:
- Each element of `results` is printed on a new line.
- An extra newline separates the results of different test cases.

Output: **[Each element of results on a new line, with an additional newline separating the results of different test cases]**
