Let's analyze the problem and the provided code in detail, using the annotated version to validate the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine if a subarray can be divided into `k > 1` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. The key insight is that if a subarray's XOR is zero, it can always be divided into parts with XOR zero. Otherwise, we need to check if there are indices that allow us to split the subarray into segments with equal XOR values.

### Code Analysis
The provided code follows these steps:
1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: It calculates the prefix XOR for the array. The prefix XOR array `pf` is used to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray.
2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**: A dictionary `mp` maps each prefix XOR value to the indices where it occurs.
3. **Query Processing**: For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XOR values. If the XOR is zero, it returns "YES". Otherwise, it checks if there are any indices in the prefix XOR map that can divide the subarray into segments with the same XOR.

### Validation Using Annotations
Let's validate the code using the annotated version:
- The program correctly initializes the prefix XOR array `pf` and the dictionary `mp`.
- For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
- If `x == 0`, it appends "YES" to the results, as the subarray can be trivially divided into parts with XOR zero.
- If `x != 0`, it checks if there are valid segment boundaries using binary search (`bisect_left`). The logic here is to find indices in `mp[pf[r]]` and `mp[pf[l - 1]]` that allow the subarray to be divided into segments with the same XOR.

### Detailed Reasoning
The logic for checking valid segment boundaries is crucial. The code uses `bisect_left` to find the first index in `mp[pf[r]]` that is greater than or equal to `l` and the last index in `mp[pf[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`. If such indices exist and satisfy the conditions, it means there is a way to split the subarray into segments with the same XOR.

### Conclusion
The original assessment seems accurate based on the annotated version of the code. The code correctly handles the prefix XOR calculation, mapping, and query processing. It also efficiently checks for valid segment boundaries using binary search, ensuring that it can handle the large constraints provided in the problem description.
