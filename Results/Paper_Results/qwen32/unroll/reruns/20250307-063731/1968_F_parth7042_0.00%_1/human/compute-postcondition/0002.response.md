Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `a` and `queries` are not yet processed; `idx` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`, but since `idx` is 0 and the value of `data[idx]` is not specified, we only know that `t` will be an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. All other variables remain unchanged.
