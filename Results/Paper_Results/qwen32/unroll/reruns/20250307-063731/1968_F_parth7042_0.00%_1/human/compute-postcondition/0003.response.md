Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `a` and `queries` are not yet processed; `idx` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
