The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters as per the provided function signature `def func_1():`. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function operates on test cases, each containing an integer `n`, an integer `q`, an array `a` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `q`, an array `a` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r`. The function processes these inputs and returns the results of the queries based on the provided constraints.**
