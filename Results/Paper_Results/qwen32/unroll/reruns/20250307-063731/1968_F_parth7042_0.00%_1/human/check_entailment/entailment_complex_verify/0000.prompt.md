You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if there exists a subarray within the specified range that has a bitwise XOR of zero and returns "YES" if such a subarray exists, otherwise "NO". The results for all queries in a test case are printed together, with an empty line separating the results of different test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix XOR for the array. The prefix XOR array `pf` is used to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray.

2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**: A dictionary `mp` is used to map each prefix XOR value to the indices where it occurs. This helps in quickly finding segments of the array that have the same XOR value.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XOR values. If the XOR is zero, it means the subarray can be trivially divided into any number of parts with the same XOR (each part having XOR zero).

4. **Checking for Valid Divisions**: If the XOR of the subarray is not zero, the program checks if there are any indices in the prefix XOR map that can divide the subarray into segments with the same XOR. It uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find valid segment boundaries.

The program handles edge cases such as:
- Subarrays where the XOR is zero.
- Subarrays where the XOR is non-zero but can be divided into segments with the same XOR.
- Subarrays where no valid division exists.

The code also efficiently handles the constraints provided in the problem description, including the large number of test cases and queries.

Given the above points and the lack of any identified edge cases where the program fails, the program appears to be correct.
