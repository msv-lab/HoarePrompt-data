### Reasoning:

The provided program appears to be designed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
    - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings for easier parsing.
    - It processes each test case one by one, extracting the number of elements `n`, the number of queries `q`, the array `a`, and the queries.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
    - For each test case, it calculates the prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`. This is useful because the XOR of any subarray `a[l:r+1]` can be computed in constant time as `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.

3. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**:
    - It maintains a dictionary `mp` that maps each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that value occurs in the prefix XOR array. This helps in quickly finding the indices of a particular prefix XOR value.

4. **Query Processing**:
    - For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the prefix XOR values.
    - If the XOR of the subarray is `0`, it directly appends "YES" to the results list because a subarray with XOR `0` can always be split into two or more parts with equal XOR (each part having XOR `0`).
    - Otherwise, it uses the dictionary `mp` to find the indices of the prefix XOR values `pf[r]` and `pf[l-1]` and checks if there is a valid split point between `l` and `r` using binary search (`bisect_left`).

5. **Output**:
    - After processing all queries for a test case, it appends an empty string to the results list to separate the results of different test cases.
    - Finally, it prints all results joined by newlines.

### Correctness:

The program efficiently calculates the prefix XOR values and uses a dictionary to map these values to their indices. It correctly handles the queries by checking if there is a valid split point between `l` and `r` using binary search. The logic for determining if a subarray is interesting is sound based on the problem description.

However, there is a small issue with the provided code: the function `func_1()` is called, but it is not defined in the snippet provided. The function is defined after the call, which will result in a `NameError`. Assuming the function definition is correct and placed before the call, the logic seems correct.

### Final Answer:
Given the logic and assuming the function definition is correctly placed, the program is correct. Therefore:

Correctness: **True**
