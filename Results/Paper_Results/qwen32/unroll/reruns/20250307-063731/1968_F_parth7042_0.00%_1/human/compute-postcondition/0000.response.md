The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. This input is expected to contain the values for `t`, `n`, `q`, and potentially other values depending on the number of test cases and queries.

Given the initial state, the variable `data` will be assigned the result of `input().split()`, which is a list of strings representing the input values. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `q`, and the array `a` (and potentially the queries) are integers, but they are not yet assigned values. After the `input().split()` operation, `data` will be a list of strings that need to be converted to integers for further processing.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; the array `a` and queries are not yet processed.**
