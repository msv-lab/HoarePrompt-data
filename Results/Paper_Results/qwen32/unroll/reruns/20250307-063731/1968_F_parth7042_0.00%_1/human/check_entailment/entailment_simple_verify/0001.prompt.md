You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the input in one go using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings `data`.
   - It then iterates through this list to extract the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` (number of elements in the array), `q` (number of queries), the array `a`, and the queries.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - It also maintains a dictionary `mp` where the keys are the prefix XOR values and the values are lists of indices where these prefix XOR values occur.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query defined by `l` and `r`, the program computes the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the prefix XOR array as `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
   - If `x` is `0`, it means the subarray can be split into segments where each segment XORs to `0`, and the program appends "YES" to the results.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there are indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] = pf[r]` and `pf[j] = pf[l-1]` and `l <= i <= r` and `l <= j <= r`. This is done using binary search (`bisect_left`) on the lists stored in `mp`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all queries for a test case, the program appends an empty string to the results list (which seems unnecessary but does not affect correctness).
   - Finally, it prints all results joined by newlines.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The prefix XOR array is correctly calculated, and the dictionary `mp` correctly stores the indices for each prefix XOR value.
- **Query Handling**: 
  - The check for `x == 0` is correct because if the XOR of the entire subarray is `0`, it can be split into any number of segments where each segment XORs to `0`.
  - The binary search logic to find indices `i` and `j` is correct in theory, but there is a subtle issue. The check `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l` ensures that the found indices are within the subarray bounds, but the logic does not guarantee that the segments between these indices will have the same XOR value. The current logic does not ensure that the subarray can be split into segments with equal XOR values, only that there exist indices with the same prefix XOR values.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly determine if a subarray can be split into segments with equal XOR values. The binary search logic alone is not sufficient to ensure that the subarray can be split into such segments. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
