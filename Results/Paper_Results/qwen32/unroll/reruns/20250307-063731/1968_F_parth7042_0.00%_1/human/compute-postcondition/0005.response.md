The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The current state describes `t` as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, which means the loop will definitely execute at least once given the provided range for `t`.

Since the loop head only involves `t`, and `t` is already within a range that ensures the loop will execute, no adjustment is needed for the loop to start executing. The other variables (`n`, `q`, `data`, `a`, `queries`, `idx`, `results`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; `data` is a list of strings representing the input values; `a` and `queries` are not yet processed; `idx` is 1; `results` is an empty list**
