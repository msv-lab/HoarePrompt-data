### Reasoning:
The program is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case involves a string `s`. The program's logic is as follows:

1. **Single Character Check**: If the string `s` has only one character, it is impossible to rearrange it to form a different string, so the program correctly outputs "No".
2. **Uniform Character Check**: If the string `s` consists of the same character repeated multiple times (i.e., all characters in the set of `s` are the same), rearranging it will still result in the same string. Therefore, the program correctly outputs "No" in this case as well.
3. **Rearrangement**: For strings that do not meet the above conditions, the program attempts to create a new string `s2` by randomly shuffling the characters of `s`. If the shuffled string `s2` is the same as the original string `s`, it instead rotates the string by moving the first character to the end. This ensures that `s2` is different from `s` and then outputs "Yes" followed by the rearranged string `s2`.

The logic appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution summary. The program handles all edge cases appropriately and provides a valid rearrangement when possible.

### Correctness: **True**
