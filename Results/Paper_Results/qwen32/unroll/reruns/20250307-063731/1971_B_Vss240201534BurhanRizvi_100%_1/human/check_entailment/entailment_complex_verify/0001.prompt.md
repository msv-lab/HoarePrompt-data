You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: For each test case, either "No" if the string length is 1 or all characters are the same, or "Yes" followed by a modified version of the string `s` which is a random permutation or a rotated version of the string if the random permutation matches the original string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string `s`. For each string, it checks if the string length is 1 or if all characters in the string are the same. If either condition is true, it outputs "No". Otherwise, it outputs "Yes" followed by a modified version of the string `s`, which is either a random permutation of the string or a rotated version of the string if the random permutation matches the original string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Single Character Case**:
   - If the length of `s` is 1, the program outputs "NO" because it's impossible to rearrange a single character to form a different string.
   - This is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **All Characters Identical Case**:
   - If all characters in `s` are the same (checked using `len(set(s)) == 1`), the program outputs "NO" because rearranging identical characters will always result in the same string.
   - This is also correct according to the problem statement.

4. **General Case**:
   - If the string `s` has more than one character and not all characters are identical, the program attempts to rearrange the string.
   - It uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to create a random permutation of the string.
   - If the generated permutation `s2` is the same as the original string `s`, it adjusts `s2` by rotating the string (i.e., `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`).
   - The program then outputs "YES" followed by the rearranged string `s2`.

5. **Checking the Rearrangement**:
   - The program ensures that the rearranged string `s2` is not equal to the original string `s` by checking if `s == s2` and adjusting accordingly.
   - This part is crucial to meet the requirement of forming a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`.

6. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs "YES" or "NO" in any case (upper or lower), which is acceptable according to the problem statement.
   - It outputs the rearranged string `s2` on the next line when a valid rearrangement is possible.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem statement and ensures that the rearranged string is different from the original string when possible. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
