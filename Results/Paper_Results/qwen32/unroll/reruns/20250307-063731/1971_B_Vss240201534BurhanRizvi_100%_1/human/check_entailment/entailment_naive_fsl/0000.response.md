Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses `random.sample` to shuffle the string `s`, and if the shuffled string `s2` is the same as the original string `s`, it performs a simple rotation (`s[1:] + s[0]`). However, this approach does not guarantee that `s2` will be different from `s` for all possible inputs, especially when the string has repeated characters or a specific pattern that makes the rotation ineffective.

Consider the following counterexample:
- Input: `cc`
- Expected Output: `NO`
- Actual Output: `YES cc` (since `cc` rotated is still `cc`)

This demonstrates that the program does not handle all cases correctly, specifically when the string consists of only two identical characters. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
