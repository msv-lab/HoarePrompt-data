Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. The program uses `random.sample` which may not always produce a different string from the original string `s`. While it does check if `s == s2` and then attempts to swap the first and last characters, there is no guarantee that this will always produce a different string, especially for strings with repeated characters.

2. The program prints "No" in lowercase, but the problem allows for "NO" to be printed in any case. While this is not a correctness issue per se, it does not strictly adhere to the problem's specifications.

3. The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if the string consists of all the same characters except for one, the program may still output a rearrangement that is the same as the original string.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s_list = list(s)
            s_list[0], s_list[-1] = s_list[-1], s_list[0]  # Swap first and last characters
            s2 = ''.join(s_list)
            if s == s2:
                # If swapping first and last characters didn't work, find another way to rearrange
                for i in range(1, len(s_list)):
                    if s_list[i] != s_list[0]:
                        s_list[0], s_list[i] = s_list[i], s_list[0]
                        break
                s2 = ''.join(s_list)
            print('YES')
            print(s2)

func()
```

This version ensures that a different rearrangement is always produced when possible and handles all edge cases correctly.
