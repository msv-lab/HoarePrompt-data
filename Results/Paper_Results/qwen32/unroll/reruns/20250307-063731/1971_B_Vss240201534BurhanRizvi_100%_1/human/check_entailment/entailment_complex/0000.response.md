### Reasoning:

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly identifies and handles the edge cases where the string `s` has a length of 1 or consists of all identical characters. In these cases, it prints "NO" because no rearrangement can result in a different string.

2. **Random Permutation:**
   - The program attempts to create a new string `s2` by generating a random permutation of the characters in `s` using `random.sample(s, len(s))`. This is a valid approach to try and get a different string.

3. **Fallback Mechanism:**
   - If the randomly generated string `s2` is the same as the original string `s`, the program falls back to rotating the string by moving the first character to the end (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`). This ensures that a different string is always produced if possible.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints "YES" followed by the modified string `s2` if a valid rearrangement is found. If not, it prints "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the given problem requirements and edge cases. It ensures that the output string is different from the input string when possible and correctly identifies when it is impossible to do so.

Correctness: **True**
