The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string `s`. For each string, it checks if the string length is 1 or if all characters in the string are the same. If either condition is true, it outputs "No". Otherwise, it outputs "Yes" followed by a modified version of the string `s`, which is either a random permutation of the string or a rotated version of the string if the random permutation matches the original string.
