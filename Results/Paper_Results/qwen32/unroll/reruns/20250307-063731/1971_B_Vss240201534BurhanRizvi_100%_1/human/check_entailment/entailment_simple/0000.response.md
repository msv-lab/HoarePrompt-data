### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine if it is correct.

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - For each test case, we need to check if we can rearrange the characters of the string `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`.
   - If it's not possible to form such a string `r`, we should output "NO".
   - If it is possible, we should output "YES" followed by one such rearrangement.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the string `s` has a length of 1, it is impossible to rearrange it to form a different string, so the output should be "NO".
   - If all characters in the string `s` are the same (e.g., "aaaaa"), any rearrangement will still result in the same string, so the output should be "NO".
   - For any other string, it is always possible to rearrange the characters to form a different string.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the string `s`.
   - It then checks if the length of `s` is 1 or if all characters in `s` are the same. If either condition is true, it outputs "NO".
   - Otherwise, it attempts to create a new string `s2` by randomly permuting the characters of `s`.
   - If the randomly permuted string `s2` is the same as the original string `s`, it rotates the string by moving the first character to the end.
   - It then outputs "YES" followed by the modified string `s2`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for handling strings of length 1 and strings with all identical characters is correct.
   - The logic for generating a different string by random permutation and rotation is also correct. If the random permutation results in the same string, rotating the string ensures that the output is different from the original string.
   - The code handles all possible edge cases and provides the correct output as per the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a rearrangement of the string `s` can be formed that is different from `s` and outputs the correct results for all test cases.

**Correctness: True**
