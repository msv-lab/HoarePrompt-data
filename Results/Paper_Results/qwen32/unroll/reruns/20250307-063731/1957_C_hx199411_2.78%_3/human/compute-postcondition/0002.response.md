To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's break down the provided code and understand how the output is derived based on the initial state and the loop's behavior.

### Code Explanation:

1. **Loop Initialization:**
   - The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n` is the size of the grid.
     - `k` is the number of moves.
     - For each move, `r_i` and `c_i` denote the row and column of the move.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `num` is initialized to 0. It counts the number of moves that affect the grid.
   - For each move:
     - If `r_i` equals `c_i` (i.e., the move is on the main diagonal), `num` is incremented by 1.
     - Otherwise, `num` is incremented by 2.
   - `m` is calculated as `n - num`. This represents the number of cells left unvisited after all moves.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - If `m` is 0, the output is 0 (all cells are visited).
   - If `m` is 1, the output is 1 (only one cell is left unvisited).
   - If `m` is greater than 1, a dynamic programming (DP) approach is used to calculate the number of ways to visit the remaining `m` cells. The DP array `dp` is used where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to visit `i` cells. The result is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Output State Calculation:

Given the loop runs `t` times, and for each test case, the output is determined based on the value of `m`, the output state will be a series of outputs, one for each test case.

Let's consider a sample input to illustrate the output state:

**Sample Input:**
```
2
3 2
1 1
2 3
4 3
1 1
2 2
3 3
```

**Processing:**

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 3`, `k = 2`
   - Moves: `(1, 1)` and `(2, 3)`
   - `num = 1 + 2 = 3`
   - `m = 3 - 3 = 0`
   - Output: `0`

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 4`, `k = 3`
   - Moves: `(1, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, and `(3, 3)`
   - `num = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
   - `m = 4 - 3 = 1`
   - Output: `1`

**Output State:**
```
0
1
```

### Final Output State:

Output State: **0\n1**

This represents the output for the two test cases provided in the sample input. The output state will vary depending on the specific values of `n`, `k`, and the moves for each test case. The format strictly adheres to the problem's requirements, with each test case's output printed on a new line.
