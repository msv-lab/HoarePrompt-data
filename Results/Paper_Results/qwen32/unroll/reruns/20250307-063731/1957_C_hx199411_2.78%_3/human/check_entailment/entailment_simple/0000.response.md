### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations of a chessboard after a series of rook placements, with the constraint that no two rooks can attack each other. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the code:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` representing the positions of the rooks placed by the player.

2. **Counting Non-Mirrored Moves:**
   - The variable `num` is used to count the number of moves where the player placed a rook at `(r, r)`, which cannot be mirrored by the computer.
   - For each move, if `r == c`, it increments `num` by 1.
   - Otherwise, it increments `num` by 2 because each non-diagonal move results in two rooks being placed (one by the player and one by the computer).

3. **Calculating Remaining Empty Slots:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`, representing the number of rows/columns that are still empty and can potentially be used for further moves.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - If `m == 0`, there are no more moves possible, and the output is `0`.
   - If `m == 1`, there is only one possible configuration, so the output is `1`.
   - For `m > 1`, a dynamic programming approach is used to calculate the number of different configurations:
     - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in `i` rows/columns.
     - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
     - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to compute the number of configurations for larger values of `m`.

5. **Output:**
   - The result for each test case is printed modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Correctness:

The logic for counting non-mirrored moves and the dynamic programming approach seem correct based on the problem description. However, there are a few points to consider:

- **Recurrence Relation:** The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to calculate the number of configurations. This relation is derived from the fact that for each new row/column, you can either place a rook in it (which corresponds to `dp[i - 1]`), or you can choose any of the previous `i - 1` positions to place a rook (which corresponds to `(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2`).

- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases where `m == 0` and `m == 1` correctly.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem constraints and the provided code, the logic appears to be correct. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for solving the problem efficiently.

**Correctness: True**
