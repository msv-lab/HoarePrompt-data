#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.
def func():
    t = int(input())

        t -= 1
        
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

            c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:

            dp[1] = 1

            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)

    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases where each test case involves a grid of size `n` and a series of `k` moves. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of ways the computer can place its remaining moves on the grid to ensure a win, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). If no moves are left for the computer, it prints `0` or `1` based on whether the player has won or the game is a draw.
