Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly compute the number of different final configurations of the chessboard after all valid moves are made. The dynamic programming (DP) approach used in the program is incorrect for this problem.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `num`:** The variable `num` is used to count the number of positions that are either occupied or "blocked" by previous moves. However, the way it is incremented is flawed. Specifically, incrementing `num` by 2 for non-diagonal moves is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that placing a rook on (r, c) blocks both (r, c) and (c, r), but only one of these positions should be counted as occupied or blocked.

2. **Incorrect DP Transition:** The DP transition formula used in the program is incorrect. The formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` does not correctly model the problem of placing non-attacking rooks on a chessboard. The correct approach involves combinatorial counting of the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining free cells.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Count the Number of Free Rows and Columns:** After processing the `k` moves, count the number of rows and columns that are still free (i.e., not occupied or blocked by previous moves).
2. **Calculate the Number of Configurations:** The number of ways to place rooks on the remaining free rows and columns can be calculated using combinatorial methods, specifically the number of ways to choose and arrange rooks on a reduced chessboard.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, and therefore, the correctness is **False**.
