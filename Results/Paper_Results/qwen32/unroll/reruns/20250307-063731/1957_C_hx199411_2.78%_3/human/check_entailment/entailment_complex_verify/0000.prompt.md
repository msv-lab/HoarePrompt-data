You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases where each test case involves a grid of size `n` and a series of `k` moves. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of ways the computer can place its remaining moves on the grid to ensure a win, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). If no moves are left for the computer, it prints `0` or `1` based on whether the player has won or the game is a draw.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly account for all potential cases and edge conditions described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the situation where the computer skips its turn due to a move being on the main diagonal (i.e., when `r = c`). While the program does increment the `num` counter correctly when `r = c`, it does not properly adjust the remaining moves (`m`) or the dynamic programming (DP) table to reflect the fact that the computer does not place a rook in those cases.

Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Counting Moves**:
   - The program correctly increments `num` by 1 when `r = c` and by 2 otherwise.
   - This correctly accounts for the number of positions occupied by rooks after `k` moves.

2. **Remaining Moves**:
   - The program calculates `m = n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions available for rooks.
   - However, the program does not correctly account for the fact that when `r = c`, the computer skips its turn. This means that the number of remaining moves for the player and the computer is not evenly split.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - The DP table is initialized and populated based on the assumption that each move by the player is mirrored by the computer.
   - However, when `r = c`, the computer skips its turn, which affects the number of valid configurations. The current DP logic does not handle this scenario correctly.

### Example Case:
Consider a 4x4 board with 1 move already made at (1, 1). According to the problem, the computer skips its turn because `r = c`. The remaining positions are 12, and the player can place rooks in these positions without any immediate mirroring by the computer. The DP table should be adjusted to reflect this, but the current program does not handle this scenario correctly.

### Correct Approach:
- The program should maintain separate counters for the player's and the computer's moves.
- When `r = c`, the computer skips its turn, so the number of remaining moves for the computer should not be incremented.
- The DP table should be recalculated based on the actual number of moves made by the player and the computer.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and thus the Correctness is **False**.
