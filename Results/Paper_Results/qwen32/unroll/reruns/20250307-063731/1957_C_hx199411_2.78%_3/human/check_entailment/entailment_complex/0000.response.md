### Reasoning:

The problem involves a chessboard game where you and the computer take turns placing rooks on an n x n board. The key points are:

1. **Moves and Mirroring**: You start by placing a white rook at (r, c), and the computer mirrors your move by placing a black rook at (c, r). If r == c, the computer skips its turn.
2. **Objective**: Determine the number of distinct final configurations possible after k moves, considering the mirroring rules.
3. **Constraints**: The board size `n` can be up to \(3 \times 10^5\), and the number of moves `k` can be up to `n`.

The provided Python function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case as follows:
- It reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.
- It iterates through the `k` moves, counting how many are on the diagonal (r == c) and how many are off the diagonal.
- It calculates the number of remaining moves `m` that can be made on the board.
- If `m` is 0, there are no more moves possible, and the result is `0`.
- If `m` is 1, there is exactly one way to place the remaining rook, and the result is `1`.
- For `m > 1`, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations. The dynamic programming array `dp` is used to store the number of ways to place `i` rooks on the board without any two attacking each other.

The dynamic programming transition formula used is:
\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) \]
This formula reflects the fact that for each new rook placement, you can either place it in a new row/column (without mirroring) or place it with mirroring, considering the constraints of the game.

### Correctness:

The function correctly implements the logic for calculating the number of distinct final configurations based on the given constraints and rules. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the solution is efficient and can handle the maximum input sizes.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
