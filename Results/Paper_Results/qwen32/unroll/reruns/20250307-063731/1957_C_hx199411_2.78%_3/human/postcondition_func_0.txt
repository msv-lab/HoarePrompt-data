The function processes multiple test cases where each test case involves a grid of size `n` and a series of `k` moves. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of ways the computer can place its remaining moves on the grid to ensure a win, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). If no moves are left for the computer, it prints `0` or `1` based on whether the player has won or the game is a draw.
