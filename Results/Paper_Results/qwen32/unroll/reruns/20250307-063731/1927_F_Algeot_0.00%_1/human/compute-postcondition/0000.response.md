The given code snippet only sets the recursion limit for the Python interpreter using `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `u`, `v`, or `w`, as these variables are not directly manipulated by this line of code. The recursion limit is being set to 1,000,000, which is a common practice to allow deeper recursion in algorithms that require it, such as graph traversal algorithms.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n - 1)/2, 2 * 10^5). Each of the `m` edges is represented by three integers `u`, `v`, and `w` where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. There is at most one edge between any pair of vertices, and the graph does not contain loops. The sum of `m` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The recursion limit is set to 1,000,000.**
