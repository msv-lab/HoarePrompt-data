Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n - 1)/2, 2 * 10^5). Each of the m edges is represented by three integers u, v, and w where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. There is at most one edge between any pair of vertices, and the graph does not contain loops. The sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
