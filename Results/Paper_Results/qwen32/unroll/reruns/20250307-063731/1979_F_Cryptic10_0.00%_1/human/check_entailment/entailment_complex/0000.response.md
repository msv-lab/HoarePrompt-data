### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify that the program adheres to the problem description and correctly outputs a Hamiltonian path for each test case within the given constraints.

#### Key Points to Consider:

1. **Graph Structure**:
   - The graph is initially a complete undirected graph with `n` vertices.
   - Exactly `n-2` edges are removed, ensuring that a Hamiltonian path always exists.

2. **Queries**:
   - The program can ask queries of the form `? d`, where `d` is a non-negative integer.
   - The response to the query `? d` provides two integers `v` and `u`:
     - `v` is the vertex with the minimum degree that is at least `d`.
     - `u` is another vertex that is not connected to `v`. If no such `u` exists, `u` is `0`.
   - If no vertex `v` with degree at least `d` exists, the response is `0 0`.

3. **Hamiltonian Path**:
   - The program needs to output a Hamiltonian path, which is a path that visits each vertex exactly once.
   - The path should be printed in the format `! v1 v2 ... vn`.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:

- **Function `func_1(d)`**:
  - It correctly formats and sends the query `? d` to the interactor.
  - It reads the response and returns the tuple `(v, u)`.

- **Function `func_2(n)`**:
  - It initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices in the Hamiltonian path.
  - It uses a set `remaining_vertices` to keep track of the vertices that have not been included in the path yet.
  - It iteratively queries the interactor with decreasing values of `d` until it finds a valid vertex `v` with degree at least `d`.
  - Once a valid vertex `v` is found, it is added to the path, and the vertex is removed from `remaining_vertices`.
  - The loop continues until all vertices are included in the path.
  - Finally, it prints the Hamiltonian path in the required format.

#### Correctness:

- The program ensures that it does not exceed the maximum allowed number of queries (`n`).
- It correctly processes the responses from the interactor and constructs the Hamiltonian path.
- The logic for selecting vertices and constructing the path is sound and aligns with the problem description.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality and adheres to the problem constraints.

**Correctness: True**
