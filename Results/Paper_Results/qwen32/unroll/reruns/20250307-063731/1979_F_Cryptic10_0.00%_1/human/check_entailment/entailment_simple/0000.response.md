### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph by iteratively removing vertices based on their degree. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the number of vertices in the graph.

2. **Finding the Hamiltonian Path**:
   - The function `func_2` is called for each test case with `n` as the argument.
   - Inside `func_2`, it initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices in the order they are added to the Hamiltonian path.
   - It also initializes a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from `1` to `n`.

3. **Querying for Vertices**:
   - The program uses a nested loop to query for vertices with decreasing degrees starting from `n-1` down to `0`.
   - For each degree `d`, it calls `func_1(d)` to get the vertex `v` with the minimum degree at least `d` and a vertex `u` not connected to `v`.
   - If `v` is `0`, it means no such vertex was found, and the loop continues with the next degree.
   - If `v` is found and is still in `remaining_vertices`, it is added to `path`, and `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`.

4. **Termination**:
   - The loop continues until all vertices have been removed from `remaining_vertices`.
   - Once all vertices are in `path`, the program prints the path in the required format.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Degree Queries**: The program correctly queries for vertices with decreasing degrees, ensuring that it finds vertices with the minimum degree first, which aligns with the problem's requirements.
- **Vertex Removal**: The program removes vertices from `remaining_vertices` as they are added to `path`, ensuring that each vertex is only added once.
- **Output**: The final output is a Hamiltonian path, which is a sequence of vertices that visits each vertex exactly once. Since the problem guarantees that a Hamiltonian path always exists, the program's approach is valid.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using the allowed number of queries and the provided interaction protocol.

**Correctness: True**
