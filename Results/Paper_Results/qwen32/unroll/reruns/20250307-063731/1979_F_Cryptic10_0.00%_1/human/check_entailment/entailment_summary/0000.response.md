### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its functions to determine if they meet the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Graph Structure**: A complete undirected graph with `n` vertices, from which `(n - 2)` edges have been removed.
2. **Interaction**: We can ask up to `n` queries of the form `"? d"`, where `d` is a non-negative integer. The response will be a tuple `(v, u)`:
   - `v` is a vertex with a degree of at least `d`, with ties broken by the smallest degree and smallest vertex number.
   - `u` is another vertex not connected to `v`, or `0` if no such vertex exists.
3. **Objective**: Construct a Hamiltonian path in the original graph using at most `n` queries.
4. **Constraints**: The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `10^5`.

#### Functions Provided:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function sends a query to the interactor and reads the response. It returns the tuple `(v, u)` received from the interactor.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function constructs the Hamiltonian path by iteratively selecting vertices using `func_1` and removing them from the set of remaining vertices. It prints the path once all vertices are included.

#### Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly sends a query in the format `"? d"` and reads the response.
   - It flushes the output buffer after sending the query, which is crucial for the interaction protocol.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function initializes an empty path and a set of remaining vertices.
   - It iteratively queries the interactor for vertices with decreasing values of `d` (from `n-1` to `0`).
   - If a valid vertex `v` is found (i.e., `v != 0` and `v` is still in the set of remaining vertices), it adds `v` to the path and removes it from the set of remaining vertices.
   - The loop continues until all vertices are included in the path.
   - Finally, it prints the path in the required format.

#### Correctness:
- **Query Strategy**: The strategy of querying with decreasing values of `d` ensures that we prioritize vertices with higher degrees first, which helps in forming a path efficiently.
- **Handling Responses**: The function correctly handles the responses from the interactor, including cases where no valid vertex is found (`v == 0`).
- **Efficiency**: The function ensures that the number of queries does not exceed `n`, as required by the problem constraints.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the required logic to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using the allowed number of queries.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
