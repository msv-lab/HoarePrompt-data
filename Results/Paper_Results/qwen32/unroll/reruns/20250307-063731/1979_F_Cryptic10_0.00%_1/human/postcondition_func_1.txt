The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a graph, where `2 <= n <= 10^5`. It constructs a path that includes all vertices from `1` to `n` in a specific order by iteratively selecting vertices and removing them from a set of remaining vertices. The function prints a line starting with an exclamation mark followed by the space-separated vertices in the order they were removed.
