To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the loop condition: `while remaining_vertices:`. This loop will continue to execute as long as `remaining_vertices` is not an empty set.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `path` is an empty list.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`.

The loop condition depends solely on `remaining_vertices`. For the loop to execute at least once, `remaining_vertices` must not be empty. Since `remaining_vertices` is already described as a set containing integers from 1 to `n`, it will definitely not be empty if `n` is at least 2.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time, as `remaining_vertices` will inherently contain elements from 1 to `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`.**
