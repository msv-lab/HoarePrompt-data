The code snippet initializes a set `remaining_vertices` with values from 1 to `n` inclusive. This means `remaining_vertices` will contain all the vertices of the graph as individual elements in a set.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `path` is an empty list.

After executing the code:
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`.**
