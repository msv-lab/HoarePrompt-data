The provided code snippet only contains `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is a call to flush the output buffer. This operation does not affect the values of any variables or the state of the program in terms of variable values. Therefore, the variables `n`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop; `path`: Contains all the vertices from `1` to `n` in the order they were removed from `remaining_vertices`; `remaining_vertices`: Is an empty set because all vertices have been removed.**
