To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to analyze the behavior of the code:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`: A positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph.
   - `path`: An empty list.
   - `remaining_vertices`: A set containing integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `remaining_vertices` is not empty.
   - Inside the loop, there is a `for` loop that iterates from `n-1` down to `0`.
   - For each iteration of the `for` loop, the function `func_1(d)` is called, which presumably returns two values `v` and `u`.
   - If `v` is `0`, the loop continues to the next iteration.
   - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is appended to `path`, removed from `remaining_vertices`, and the inner loop breaks, moving to the next iteration of the outer loop.

The key here is that `remaining_vertices` starts with all vertices from `1` to `n` and vertices are removed from it one by one as they are added to `path`. The loop terminates when `remaining_vertices` is empty.

**Output State:**
- `n`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `path`: Contains all the vertices from `1` to `n` in the order they were removed from `remaining_vertices`.
- `remaining_vertices`: Is an empty set because all vertices have been removed.

Output State: **`path` contains all integers from 1 to `n` in the order they were removed from `remaining_vertices`, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.**
