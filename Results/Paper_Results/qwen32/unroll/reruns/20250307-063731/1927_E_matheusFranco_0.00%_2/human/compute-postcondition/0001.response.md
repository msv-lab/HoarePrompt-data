In this case, the loop condition is `t > 0`. The variable `t` is described as an input integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`. Since `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1 and at most 10,000, the condition `t > 0` will always be true for the given range of `t`.

Therefore, no adjustment to the state is necessary for the loop to execute the first time. The loop will definitely execute because `t` is always greater than 0 given the constraints.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
