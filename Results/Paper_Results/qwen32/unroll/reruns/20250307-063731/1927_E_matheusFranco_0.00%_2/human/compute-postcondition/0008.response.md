To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and work through the implications of the variables and the construction of the `permutation` list.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n` and `k`**:
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `k` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even.
   
2. **`permutation`**:
   - `permutation` is a list of `n` integers from `1` to `n` in a specific order determined by the multiples of `k` plus `i`.
   - The specific order is not explicitly defined in the problem statement, but we can infer that it involves some pattern based on multiples of `k` and an index `i`.

3. **`idx` and `idx_v`**:
   - `idx` is initialized to `0`.
   - `idx_v` is initialized to `1`.

4. **`curr_v`**:
   - `curr_v` is initialized to `n + 1`.

5. **`result`**:
   - `result` is a string that contains the space-separated values of the `permutation` list.

### Analysis:
The `permutation` list is constructed based on a pattern involving multiples of `k` and an index `i`. However, the exact construction of the `permutation` list is not detailed in the problem statement. Therefore, we can only describe the `result` in terms of the `permutation` list.

### Output:
Since the exact construction of the `permutation` list is not specified, we can only describe the `result` in terms of the space-separated values of the `permutation` list.

Output: **result (where result is the space-separated values of the permutation list)**
