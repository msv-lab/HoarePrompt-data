Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` now holds the integer value provided by the input. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4 still holds, as the input is expected to be within this range.
