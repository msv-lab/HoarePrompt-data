The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. Since `k` is given to be an integer such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even, the loop will execute as long as `k` is at least 2. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

The state of `n`, `permutation`, `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` are not directly related to the execution of the for loop, so they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `k` is at least 2 (which is already given in the problem statement, so no adjustment is needed for `k` itself).

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n`, and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 1; `i` is 0**
