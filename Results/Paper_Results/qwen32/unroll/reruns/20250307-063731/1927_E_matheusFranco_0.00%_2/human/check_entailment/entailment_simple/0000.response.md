### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a **k-level permutation** of length **n** where the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length **k** is no more than 1. The provided solution involves two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function handles multiple test cases.
- **Execution**: It reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- **State Before Call**: `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- **State After Execution**: `t` is decremented until it reaches 0.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function constructs a k-level permutation for a single test case.
- **Execution**:
  1. **Input Reading**: Reads integers `n` and `k`.
  2. **Initialization**: Initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros, and variables `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v`.
  3. **Permutation Construction**:
     - Iterates over `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
     - For each `i`, it places the current value `curr_v` at positions in `permutation` that are multiples of `k` plus `i`.
     - This ensures that each segment of length `k` will have a similar sum because the values are distributed evenly across the segments.
  4. **Output**: Converts the `permutation` list to a space-separated string and prints it.

### Analysis of the Solution:
- **Correctness of Permutation Construction**:
  - The algorithm places values in a way that ensures the sums of any two segments of length `k` differ by at most 1. This is because the values are distributed evenly across the segments, and the difference in sums is minimized.
  - For example, in the test case `n = 10, k = 4`, the output `1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6` ensures that the sums of all segments of length 4 are either 23 or 22, satisfying the k-level condition.

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
  - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1` until all test cases are processed.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case, ensuring that the sums of any two segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
