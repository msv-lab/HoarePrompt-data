To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's break down the code's behavior:

1. The loop runs `k` times, where `k` is an even integer.
2. For each iteration `i` of the loop, the inner `while` loop fills the `permutation` list with values starting from `curr_v` at positions that are multiples of `k` plus `i`.
3. The `curr_v` is incremented each time a value is placed in the `permutation` list.
4. The `multiples_of_k_plus_i` variable is used to track the positions in the `permutation` list to be updated.

Let's see how the `permutation` list is updated for each iteration of `i`:

- For `i = 0`, positions `0, k, 2k, ..., nk` are updated with values `curr_v, curr_v+1, curr_v+2, ...`.
- For `i = 1`, positions `1, k+1, 2k+1, ..., nk+1` are updated with values `curr_v, curr_v+1, curr_v+2, ...`.
- This pattern continues until `i = k-1`.

Since `k` is even, the pattern will fill the `permutation` list in a way that every position from `0` to `n-1` will be filled with a unique value from `1` to `n`.

Thus, the `permutation` list will be filled with values from `1` to `n` in a specific order determined by the multiples of `k` plus `i`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n`, and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` integers from `1` to `n` in a specific order determined by the multiples of `k` plus `i`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `n+1`.**
