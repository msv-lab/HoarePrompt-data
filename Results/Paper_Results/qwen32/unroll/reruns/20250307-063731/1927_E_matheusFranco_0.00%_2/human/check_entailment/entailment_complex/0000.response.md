### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length k is no more than 1. The provided code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's a detailed analysis of the correctness of the code based on the problem description:

1. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **Purpose:** This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Execution:** It reads an integer `t` and then enters a loop that runs `t` times. In each iteration, it calls `func_1`, which constructs and prints a permutation for a given `n` and `k`.
   - **State Transition:** Before the call, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. After all iterations, `t` becomes 0.
   - **Correctness:** `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Purpose:** This function constructs and prints a k-level permutation for given `n` and `k`.
   - **Execution:**
     - It initializes an empty permutation list of length `n` with zeros.
     - It iterates `k` times, and for each iteration `i`, it fills the permutation list at positions that are multiples of `k` plus `i` with sequential integers starting from 1.
     - After filling the permutation list, it converts the list to a space-separated string and prints it.
   - **State Transition:** Before the call, `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even. After the execution, the permutation list is filled with integers from 1 to `n` in a specific order, and the result is printed.
   - **Correctness:** The function fills the permutation list by placing integers in a specific pattern based on multiples of `k` plus an offset. However, this pattern does not guarantee that the resulting permutation is a k-level permutation. The sums of continuous segments of length `k` may not differ by no more than 1, which is a requirement for a k-level permutation.

### Analysis:

The given code does not ensure that the constructed permutation is a k-level permutation. The pattern used to fill the permutation list does not guarantee that the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` will differ by no more than 1. This is a critical requirement for the permutation to be considered k-level.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not meet the problem requirements for constructing a k-level permutation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
