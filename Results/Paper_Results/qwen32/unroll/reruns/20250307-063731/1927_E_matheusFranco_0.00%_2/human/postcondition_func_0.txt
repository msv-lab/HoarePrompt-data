The function generates and prints a permutation of `n` integers based on specific multiples of `k`, where `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n`. The permutation is constructed such that certain positions in the list are filled with sequential integers starting from 1, following a pattern determined by the multiples of `k` plus an offset. The final output is a space-separated string of the generated permutation.
