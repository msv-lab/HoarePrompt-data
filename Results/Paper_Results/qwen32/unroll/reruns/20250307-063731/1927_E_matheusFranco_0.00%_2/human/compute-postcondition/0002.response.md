To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the provided loop:

```python
while t > 0:
    func_1()
    t -= 1
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. In each iteration, `func_1()` is called, and then `t` is decremented by 1. This process repeats until `t` is no longer greater than 0.

Given the initial state where `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, the loop will execute exactly `t` times. After each iteration, `t` decreases by 1. Therefore, after `t` iterations, `t` will be 0.

The function `func_1()` is called `t` times, but since its internal behavior is not specified, we can only state that it will be executed `t` times.

The output state will only reflect the change in the variable `t` since it is the only variable directly affected by the loop. All other variables (if any) in the initial state that are not mentioned in the loop will remain unchanged.

Output State: **t is 0.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the variable `t` will have the value 0. All other variables in the initial state that are not affected by the loop will remain in their original state.
