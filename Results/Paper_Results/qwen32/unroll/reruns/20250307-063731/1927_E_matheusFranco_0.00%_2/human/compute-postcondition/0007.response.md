The code snippet provided joins the elements of the `permutation` list into a single string with each element separated by a space. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `k`, `permutation`, `idx`, `idx_v`, or `curr_v`. It only creates a new string variable `result`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n`, and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` integers from `1` to `n` in a specific order determined by the multiples of `k` plus `i`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `n+1`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated values of the `permutation` list.**
