Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Specifically, it does not account for the possibility of turning the phone on and off at the exact moments when messages need to be sent, which could potentially save battery. The current approach simply subtracts the minimum of the energy used to keep the phone on or the energy used to turn it off and on between each pair of messages. However, this does not consider the optimal strategy for turning the phone on and off.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the optimal strategy for turning the phone on and off. Here's a revised version of the program that correctly implements this strategy:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        (n, f, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        ls = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initial charge
        charge = f
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                # For the first message, we can only turn on the phone at 0
                charge -= a * ls[i]
            else:
                # Calculate the energy needed to keep the phone on from the last message to this one
                keep_on_energy = a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])
                # Calculate the energy needed to turn off and on the phone at this moment
                turn_on_energy = b + a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])
                
                # Choose the minimum energy option
                charge -= min(keep_on_energy, turn_on_energy)
            
            # If at any point the charge is less than or equal to 0, it's not possible to send the message
            if charge <= 0:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            # If we finish the loop without breaking, it means we can send all messages
            print('YES')
        
        t -= 1

func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Program:
1. **Initialization**: Start with the initial charge `f`.
2. **First Message**: For the first message, the phone must be on from time 0 to `ls[0]`, so we subtract `a * ls[0]` from the charge.
3. **Subsequent Messages**: For each subsequent message, we calculate two possibilities:
   - The energy to keep the phone on from the last message to the current one.
   - The energy to turn off the phone at the last message time, turn it on at the current message time, and send the message.
4. **Charge Check**: After each message, check if the charge is less than or equal to 0. If it is, print "NO" and break out of the loop.
5. **Completion**: If the loop completes without the charge dropping to 0 or below, print "YES".
