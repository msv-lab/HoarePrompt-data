In this task, the `while` loop condition is `t > 0`. The variable `t` is described as an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Given this range, `t` is guaranteed to be greater than 0, ensuring that the loop can certainly execute at least once.

Since `t` is already within a range that satisfies the loop condition (`t > 0`), no adjustment to the state is necessary for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

Therefore, the state remains the same as it is right before the loop:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `f`, `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9; `m` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= m_i <= 10^9 and m_i < m_{i + 1}. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
