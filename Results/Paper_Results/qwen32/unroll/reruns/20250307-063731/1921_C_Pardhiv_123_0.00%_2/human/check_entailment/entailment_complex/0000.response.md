### Reasoning:
The given problem requires determining if Stepan can send all messages without running out of battery. The program processes each test case by iterating through the list of message times and adjusting the phone's charge based on the time elapsed between messages and the energy cost of turning the phone on and off.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. **Initialization**: For each test case, the program reads the number of messages `n`, the initial charge `f`, the charge consumption rate `a`, and the energy cost `b` for turning the phone on and off.
2. **Processing Messages**: It then iterates through the list of message times. For each pair of consecutive message times, it calculates the energy consumed if the phone remains on (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`) and the energy consumed if the phone is turned off and on (`b`). The program subtracts the minimum of these two values from the current charge `f`.
3. **Decision Making**: After processing all messages, the program checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0. If it is, it prints "YES", indicating that Stepan can send all messages. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The logic seems correct because it correctly accounts for the energy consumption in both scenarios (phone remains on or is turned off and on) and makes the optimal decision at each step. The program efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that the solution is correct for each test case.
