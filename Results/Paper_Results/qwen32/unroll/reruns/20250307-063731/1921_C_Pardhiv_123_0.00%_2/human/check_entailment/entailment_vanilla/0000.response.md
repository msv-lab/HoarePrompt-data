To determine if the provided program is correct, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Understanding:
- Stepan needs to send `n` messages at specific moments `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`.
- The phone starts with `f` units of charge.
- The phone loses `a` units of charge per unit of time.
- Turning the phone off and on again consumes `b` units of charge.
- If the charge drops to 0 or below, Stepan cannot send any more messages.
- The goal is to determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge.

### Solution Approach:
- For each test case, read the number of messages `n`, initial charge `f`, charge consumption per unit time `a`, and the cost to turn the phone off and on `b`.
- Read the list of message sending times `ls`.
- For each pair of consecutive message times `m_{i-1}` and `m_i`, calculate the charge consumption if the phone stays on from `m_{i-1}` to `m_i`:
  - Charge consumed by staying on: `a * (m_i - m_{i-1})`
  - Charge consumed by turning off and on: `b`
- The effective charge consumption for the interval is the minimum of these two values.
- Subtract this effective charge consumption from the current charge `f`.
- After processing all intervals, if `f` is greater than 0, output "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- It iterates through the list of message times and calculates the effective charge consumption for each interval.
- It correctly updates the charge `f` based on the effective charge consumption.
- Finally, it checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0 to determine if all messages can be sent.

### Potential Issues:
- The program handles the constraints correctly, including large values for `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `m_i`.
- There are no obvious logical errors in the implementation.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. Given the constraints and the logic, the program should work as expected.

Correctness: **True**
