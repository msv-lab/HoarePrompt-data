Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 100, followed by n lines each containing two integers a and x where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.**
