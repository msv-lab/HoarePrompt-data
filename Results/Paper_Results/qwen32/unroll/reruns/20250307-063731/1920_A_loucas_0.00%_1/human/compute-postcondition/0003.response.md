Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of constraints, followed by `n` lines each containing two integers `a` and `x`. The integer `a` is a constraint type (either 1, 2, or 3), and `x` is a positive integer up to 10^9. The function processes these constraints and returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
