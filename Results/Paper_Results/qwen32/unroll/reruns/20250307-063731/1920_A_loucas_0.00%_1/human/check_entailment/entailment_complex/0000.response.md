### Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Identifying Constraints:**
   - The code correctly identifies and separates constraints of type 1, 2, and 3 into three different lists (`big`, `less`, and `no` respectively).

2. **Finding the Range:**
   - The code attempts to find the range of valid `k` values by using `max(big)` and `min(less)`. This is correct in theory, as `k` must be at least `max(big)` and at most `min(less)`.

3. **Counting Valid `k` Values:**
   - The code then iterates through the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` and checks if each value is not in the `no` list.
   - However, the code incorrectly breaks the loop after finding the first valid `k` value and assigns this value to `num`. It then prints `num`, which is not the number of valid `k` values, but rather one of the valid `k` values.
   - Additionally, if no valid `k` values are found, `num` remains 0, which is not the correct output for a case where no valid `k` values exist.

4. **Output:**
   - The code should count all valid `k` values within the range and print the count, not just find and print one valid `k` value or 0.

### Correctness:
The code does not correctly count the number of valid `k` values that satisfy all constraints. It only finds and prints one valid `k` value or 0, which is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
