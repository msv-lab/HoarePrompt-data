Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Output Handling**: The `print` statement inside the loop in `func_2` will print the results after every iteration, which is not the desired behavior. The results should be printed only after all calculations for a test case have been completed.

2. **Logic in `func_1`**: The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game as described. It only counts the number of players that can be kicked out in each round, but it does not correctly update the list of players in each round. The players that are kicked out in a round should be removed from the list of players for the subsequent rounds.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, p):
    players = list(range(1, n + 1))
    while True:
        kicked_out = set()
        for position in p:
            if position - 1 < len(players):
                kicked_out.add(players[position - 1])
        if not kicked_out:
            break
        players = [player for player in players if player not in kicked_out]
    return len(players)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

# Call the function to execute the program
func_2()
```

In this corrected version:
- `func_1` correctly simulates the game by maintaining a list of players and removing the players that are kicked out in each round.
- `func_2` collects all results for a test case before printing them, ensuring the output format is correct.
