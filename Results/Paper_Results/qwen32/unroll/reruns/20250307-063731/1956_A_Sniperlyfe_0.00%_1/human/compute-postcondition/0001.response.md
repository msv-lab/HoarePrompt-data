The loop in the provided code is controlled by the variable `t`, which represents the number of rounds or iterations the loop should execute. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable that does not affect the loop's execution condition.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0. The variables `n` and `p` are not directly involved in controlling the loop's execution, but they are part of the state before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the initial number of players in the game, `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, and `t` must be greater than 0**
