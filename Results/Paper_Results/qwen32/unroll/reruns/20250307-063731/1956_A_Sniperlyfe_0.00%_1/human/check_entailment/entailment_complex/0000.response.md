### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to ensure the correctness of the solution.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We have a sequence `a` of positions of players to be kicked out in each round.
   - We need to simulate the game for multiple queries, where each query specifies the initial number of players `n`.
   - The goal is to determine the number of players remaining at the end of the game for each query.

2. **Function `func_1(n, p)`:**
   - This function takes the initial number of players `n` and a list `p` of positions of players to be kicked out.
   - The function simulates the rounds of the game by repeatedly subtracting the count of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n` until `n` is less than the smallest position in `p`.
   - The function returns the final value of `n`, which represents the number of players remaining at the end of the game.

3. **Function `func_2()`:**
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of positions `k`, the number of queries `q`, the list of positions `p`, and the list of queries `qs`.
   - For each query `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to determine the number of remaining players and stores the result in `res`.
   - It prints the results for each query in the test case.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(n, p)` correctly simulates the game by iterating through the rounds and removing the specified players.
   - The function `func_2()` correctly reads the input and processes each test case, calling `func_1` for each query and printing the results.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles cases where `n` is less than the smallest position in `p` by returning `n` immediately.
   - The code also handles multiple queries and test cases correctly.

6. **Output:**
   - The output matches the expected results for the provided example, confirming the correctness of the implementation.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the described game and handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
