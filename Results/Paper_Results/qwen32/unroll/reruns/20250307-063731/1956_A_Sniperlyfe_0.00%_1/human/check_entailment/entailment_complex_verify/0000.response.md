Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies an issue with the output formatting of the program. The print statement inside the loop that processes each value in `qs` results in incorrect output formatting, as it prints intermediate results instead of waiting to print the final results for all queries in a test case on a single line. 

The annotations provided in the annotated code do not address this specific issue with output formatting. They correctly describe the functionality of `func_1` and the overall behavior of `func_2` up to the point of printing, but they do not highlight the error in the placement of the print statement.

The suggested correction in the original assessment moves the print statement outside the loop that processes each value in `qs`, ensuring that the results for all values in `qs` are printed on the same line, which aligns with the problem description's requirement for output formatting.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the issue with the program's output formatting and provides a correct solution to fix it.

Final: **False** (The program is incorrect due to the output formatting issue, even though the logic in `func_1` seems to be correct.)
