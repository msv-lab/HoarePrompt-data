Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the output formatting as per the problem description. Specifically, the `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))` statement is inside the loop that processes each value in `qs`. This means that for each value in `qs`, the program prints the results accumulated so far, rather than printing the result for each value in `qs` on a new line.

Here's a breakdown of the issue:

- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of winners for a given `n` using the sequence `p`.
- However, the results are printed inside the loop that processes each value in `qs`, leading to incorrect output formatting.

To fix this issue, the print statement should be moved outside the loop that processes each value in `qs`, so that the results for all values in `qs` are printed on the same line, and then a newline is printed after each test case.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))
    return n

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

In this corrected version, the `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))` statement is outside the loop that processes each value in `qs`, ensuring that the results for all values in `qs` are printed on a single line for each test case.
