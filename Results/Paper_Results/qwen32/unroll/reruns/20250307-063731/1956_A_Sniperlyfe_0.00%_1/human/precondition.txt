n is a list of integers representing the number of players in each test case, and p is a list of integers representing the positions of the players to be kicked out in each round. The length of n is q (1 ≤ q ≤ 100), and the length of p is k (1 ≤ k ≤ 100). Each element in p is a unique integer such that 1 ≤ p[i] ≤ 100 and p is sorted in increasing order.
