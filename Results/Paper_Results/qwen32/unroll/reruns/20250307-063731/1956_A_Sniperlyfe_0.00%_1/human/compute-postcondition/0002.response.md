To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to carefully analyze the provided code and understand the impact of each iteration on the variables involved.

Here's the provided code:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = []
    for n in qs:
        res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

Let's break down the loop:

1. The loop runs `t` times.
2. In each iteration, it reads two integers `k` and `q`.
3. It then reads a list `p` of integers.
4. It reads another list `qs` of integers.
5. It initializes an empty list `res`.
6. For each integer `n` in `qs`, it appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to `res` and prints the current state of `res`.

The key points to note are:
- The variable `n` in the initial state (which represents the initial number of players) is shadowed by the loop variable `n` in the inner loop.
- The list `p` is re-assigned in each iteration of the outer loop, so it does not retain its initial value after the first iteration.
- The function `func_1(n, p)` is not defined in the provided code, so we cannot determine its exact behavior. However, we can assume it processes `n` and `p` in some way and returns a value.
- The list `qs` is also re-assigned in each iteration of the outer loop.
- The list `res` is re-initialized in each iteration of the outer loop, so it only contains the results from the current iteration.

Given these points, the final state of the variables after the loop completes would be:
- `n` retains its initial value since it is not modified within the loop.
- `p` holds the value it was assigned in the last iteration of the loop.
- `qs` holds the value it was assigned in the last iteration of the loop.
- `res` is an empty list because it is re-initialized at the start of each iteration and is not retained across iterations.

The output state, therefore, is:

Output State: **`n` is the initial number of players, `p` is the list of positions of players to be kicked out in the last round, `qs` is the list of queries in the last round, and `res` is an empty list.**
