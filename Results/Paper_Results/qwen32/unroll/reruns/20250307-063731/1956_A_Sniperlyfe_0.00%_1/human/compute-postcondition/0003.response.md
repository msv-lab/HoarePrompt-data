Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a non-negative integer representing the initial number of players in the game, and `p`, a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round. The function returns a list of player positions that remain after each player specified in `p` has been removed. If a position in `p` is out of the current range of players, it is ignored.**
