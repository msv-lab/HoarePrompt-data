### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a critical issue with the output formatting in the provided program. The `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))` statement is inside the loop that processes each value in `qs`, leading to incorrect output formatting, as it prints the results accumulated so far for each value in `qs` instead of printing the result for each value on a new line.

However, the original assessment suggests a fix by moving the print statement outside the loop that processes each value in `qs`. This fix ensures that the results for all values in `qs` are printed on a single line for each test case, which aligns with the problem description's requirement to output the results for each query on the same line.

The function `func_1` is described as correctly calculating the number of winners for a given `n` using the sequence `p`, and there is no indication that `func_1` itself is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the formatting issue and providing a correct fix. The program as originally written does not meet the output formatting requirements specified in the problem description. After applying the suggested fix, the program would be correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the formatting issue, but it would be correct after applying the suggested fix.) 

However, since the task is to evaluate the correctness of the given program as it is, without applying fixes, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
