### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and its functions to see if they correctly solve the problem described.

**Function 1 (`func_1`):**
- **Purpose:** The function `func_1(n, p)` is designed to simulate the game rounds and determine the number of players remaining after all possible rounds.
- **Logic:** 
  - It enters a loop that continues as long as `n` (the number of players) is greater than or equal to the smallest position in the list `p` (positions of players to be kicked out).
  - In each iteration, it subtracts the number of players at positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n`. This simulates the removal of players in a round.
  - The loop exits when there are no more players at positions specified in `p` that can be removed, i.e., when `n` is less than the smallest position in `p`.
  - The final value of `n` is returned, which represents the number of players remaining after the game ends.

**Function 2 (`func_2`):**
- **Purpose:** The function `func_2()` is the main function that reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
- **Logic:**
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads `k` (the number of positions in the sequence `a`), `q` (the number of queries), the sequence `a` of positions to be kicked out, and the list of queries `qs` (initial number of players for each query).
  - For each initial number of players `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to determine the number of remaining players and appends the result to the list `res`.
  - It prints the results for each query in the format required by the problem.

**Analysis:**
- The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the game rounds by iteratively removing players at specified positions until no more players can be removed.
- The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and queries, using `func_1` to determine the number of remaining players for each query.
- The output format matches the problem's requirements, printing the results for each query in the same line separated by spaces.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions together correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_1` accurately simulates the game rounds, and `func_2` correctly processes input and outputs the results.

**Correctness: True**
