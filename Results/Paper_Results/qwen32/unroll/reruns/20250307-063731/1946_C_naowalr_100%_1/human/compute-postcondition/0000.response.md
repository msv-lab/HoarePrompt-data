In the given task, the for loop depends on the value read from `sys.stdin.readline()`. The loop will execute based on the integer value of the input read from the standard input. Since there are no variables present in the function signature, the only state we can adjust is the input that will be read from `sys.stdin.readline()`.

To ensure the loop executes, the integer value read from the input must be greater than 0. The loop variable `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is a throwaway variable and is not used within the loop body.

State: **The integer value read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be greater than 0**.
