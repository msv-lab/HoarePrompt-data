#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1()`. Therefore, no precondition can be derived from the function signature alone.
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
        solve()
        
    #State: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1()`. Therefore, no postcondition can be derived from the function signature alone.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer from standard input, which specifies the number of times to execute the `solve` function. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it performs actions based on the logic within the `solve` function for the specified number of iterations.
