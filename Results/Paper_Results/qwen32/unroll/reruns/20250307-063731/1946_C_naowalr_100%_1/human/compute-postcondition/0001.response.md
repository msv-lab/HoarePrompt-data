To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the given loop and understand its behavior. Here's the loop:

```python
for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
    solve()
```

From the code snippet, we can infer that:
- The loop will iterate a number of times equal to the integer value read from standard input (`sys.stdin.readline()`).
- In each iteration, the function `solve()` is called.

Since the problem statement does not provide the implementation details of `solve()`, we can only assume that `solve()` performs some operations but does not directly affect the loop control variables (which in this case is the loop variable `_`).

The loop variable `_` is a conventional name in Python for a loop variable that we do not intend to use within the loop. It is incremented automatically by the `for` loop construct in Python, and its value is not used in the loop body.

Given that there are no other variables in the loop head or body that are modified or used outside the loop, and no variables are mentioned in the initial state that could be affected by `solve()`, the only thing that changes is the loop variable `_` itself, which is not relevant to the output state.

Thus, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state with respect to any variables that could be affected by the loop.

Output State: **No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1()`. Therefore, no postcondition can be derived from the function signature alone.**
