To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop condition is `i < n`, meaning the loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`.

Given:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5.
- `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.
- `counter` is 0.
- `i` is 0.

Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1, and `i` is initialized to 0, the condition `i < n` will be true (0 < n). Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 0, `i` is 0**
