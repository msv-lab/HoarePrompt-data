You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    print(func_1(n, s1, s2))

def func_1(n: int, s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
    counter = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and (s1[i] != s1[i + 1]):
                counter += 1
                i += 2
            else:
                counter += 1
                i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    return counter



- Function Summary: 
The function takes two binary strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length `n` and returns the count of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ, considering specific patterns of differences.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to transform the initial state of the boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`) using the minimum number of operations:
- Adding a cat to an empty box.
- Removing a cat from a box.
- Moving a cat from one box to another.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses a function `func_1` to determine the minimum number of operations required. The function iterates through the boxes and counts the number of mismatches (`s1[i] != s2[i]`). It then attempts to optimize the count by checking if two consecutive boxes can be fixed with a single operation.

#### Key Points:
1. **Mismatch Counting**: The function counts mismatches between `s1` and `s2`.
2. **Consecutive Box Check**: If two consecutive boxes are mismatched and the values in those boxes are different (`s1[i] != s1[i + 1]`), it assumes that these two mismatches can be resolved with one operation.
3. **Single Box Adjustment**: If the above condition is not met, it assumes each mismatch requires a separate operation.

#### Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for handling consecutive mismatches is flawed. The program assumes that if two consecutive boxes are mismatched, they can always be fixed with one operation. This is not always true.
- **Example**: Consider `s1 = "101"` and `s2 = "010"`. The program would count the mismatches at positions 0 and 2 and assume they can be fixed with one operation. However, it actually requires two operations (one to move the cat from position 0 to position 1, and another to move the cat from position 2 to position 1).

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to count the number of cats that need to be added, removed, or moved. The minimum number of operations required will be the sum of the absolute differences in the number of cats in the initial and desired states.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
