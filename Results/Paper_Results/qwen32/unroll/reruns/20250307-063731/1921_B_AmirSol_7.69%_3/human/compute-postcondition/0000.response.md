The code snippet initializes a variable `counter` to 0. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), and `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. The execution of the code does not affect `n`, `s1`, or `s2`; it only sets `counter` to 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 0**.
