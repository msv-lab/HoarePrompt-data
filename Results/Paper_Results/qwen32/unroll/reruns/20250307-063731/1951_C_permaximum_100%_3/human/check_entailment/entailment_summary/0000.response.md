### Reasoning:
The provided program implements a greedy algorithm to solve the problem of purchasing tickets at the minimum cost. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Heap Initialization**: The program begins by creating a min-heap of the ticket prices along with their respective indices. This allows efficient retrieval of the currently cheapest ticket price.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - It initializes `total_cost` to 0, `tickets_bought` to 0, and `price_increase` to 0.
   - It enters a loop that continues until the required number of tickets (`k`) is bought.
   - In each iteration, it pops the smallest price from the heap (which is the currently cheapest ticket price).
   - It adjusts this price by adding the `price_increase` (the total number of tickets bought so far).
   - It calculates the number of tickets to buy in the current iteration as the minimum of `m` (the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a day) and the remaining number of tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - It adds the cost of these tickets to `total_cost` and increases `tickets_bought` by the number of tickets purchased.
   - It increases `price_increase` by the number of tickets bought in the current iteration to reflect the price increase for subsequent days.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The approach ensures that tickets are always bought at the lowest available price, taking into account the increasing prices due to previous purchases.
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the cheapest tickets are prioritized, which is crucial for minimizing the total cost.
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when the number of tickets to buy in a day is limited by `m`.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets, adhering to the constraints provided.

### Correctness: **True**
