To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's walk through the logic of the provided code.

The loop continues to execute until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`. In each iteration:
1. The smallest price (along with its index, although the index is not used in this loop) is popped from the heap `pq`.
2. The price is increased by `price_increase`.
3. The number of tickets to buy in this iteration is the minimum of `m` (the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in one go) and the remaining tickets needed to reach `k` (`k - tickets_bought`).
4. The `total_cost` is updated by adding the cost of the tickets bought in this iteration (`price * tickets_to_buy`).
5. The `tickets_bought` is incremented by the number of tickets bought in this iteration.
6. The `price_increase` is incremented by the number of tickets bought in this iteration, which means the price of the next ticket will be higher.

The loop terminates when `tickets_bought` equals `k`, meaning all required tickets have been bought.

**Output State:** 
- `n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `pq` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop.
- `total_cost` will be the sum of the costs of the `k` tickets bought, considering the increasing price.
- `tickets_bought` will be equal to `k`.
- `price_increase` will be equal to `k` because it is incremented by the number of tickets bought in each iteration, and the loop runs until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.

Output State: **total_cost is the sum of the costs of the k tickets bought with increasing prices, tickets_bought is k, price_increase is k.**
