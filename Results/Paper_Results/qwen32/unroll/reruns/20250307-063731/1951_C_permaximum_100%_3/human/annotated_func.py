#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), prices is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    pq = [(price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        price += price_increase
        
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        
    #State: - `n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `pq` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop.
    #- `total_cost` will be the sum of the costs of the `k` tickets bought, considering the increasing price.
    #- `tickets_bought` will be equal to `k`.
    #- `price_increase` will be equal to `k` because it is incremented by the number of tickets bought in each iteration, and the loop runs until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
    #
    #Output State:
    return total_cost
    #The program returns `total_cost`, which is the sum of the costs of the `k` tickets bought, considering the increasing price.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the total cost of buying `k` tickets from `n` different ticket types, where each type has `m` tickets available. The tickets are bought in increasing order of price, and the price of each ticket increases by the number of tickets bought so far. The function returns the total cost of these `k` tickets.
