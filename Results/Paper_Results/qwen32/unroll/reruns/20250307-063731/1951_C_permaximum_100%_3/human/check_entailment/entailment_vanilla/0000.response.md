### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets given the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought per day and the price increases due to previous purchases.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the provided solution:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of prices `prices`.

2. **Priority Queue Initialization**: The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the prices of tickets along with their respective days. This allows the program to efficiently fetch the day with the lowest ticket price.

3. **Heapify**: The list of tuples `(price, i)` is heapified to convert it into a priority queue. This ensures that the smallest price is always at the root, allowing for efficient retrieval.

4. **Main Loop**: The program enters a loop that continues until `tickets_bought` equals `k`:
   - **Pop from Heap**: The day with the lowest current ticket price is fetched from the heap.
   - **Price Adjustment**: The price is adjusted by adding the `price_increase` which accumulates with each purchase.
   - **Tickets to Buy**: The number of tickets to buy on the current day is determined as the minimum of `m` (maximum tickets allowed per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - **Cost Calculation**: The total cost is updated by adding the product of the adjusted price and the number of tickets bought.
   - **Update Tickets Bought and Price Increase**: The number of tickets bought is updated, and the `price_increase` is incremented by the number of tickets bought on the current day.

5. **Return Result**: Once the loop exits, the total cost is returned as the result for the current test case.

### Correctness:

The solution correctly implements the required logic to find the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets while adhering to the constraints. The use of a priority queue ensures that the program always buys tickets on the day with the lowest current price, minimizing the total cost. The `price_increase` variable correctly accumulates the price increases due to previous purchases, ensuring that subsequent purchases are priced accordingly.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
