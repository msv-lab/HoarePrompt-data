### Reasoning:

The provided Python program appears to be solving the problem using a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets from the day with the lowest current price. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a priority queue (`pq`) that stores tuples of prices and their corresponding day indices.
   - The priority queue is then heapified to ensure the lowest price is always at the root.

2. **Loop Until All Tickets Are Bought**:
   - The program enters a loop that continues until the desired number of tickets (`k`) is bought.
   - In each iteration, it pops the lowest price from the priority queue.
   - The price of the ticket is adjusted by the accumulated `price_increase` (which accounts for the price increases due to previous purchases).
   - It calculates the number of tickets to buy as the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets allowed per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - The total cost is updated by adding the cost of the tickets bought on the current day.
   - The number of tickets bought is updated.
   - The `price_increase` is incremented by the number of tickets bought on the current day to account for the price increase for subsequent days.

3. **Return the Total Cost**:
   - Once the loop exits, the program returns the total cost, which is the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets considering the constraints.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets by always selecting the day with the lowest current price and considering the price increases due to previous purchases. The use of a priority queue ensures that the lowest price is always considered first, and the `price_increase` correctly tracks the cumulative effect of previous purchases on future prices.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program should correctly compute the minimum spending for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
