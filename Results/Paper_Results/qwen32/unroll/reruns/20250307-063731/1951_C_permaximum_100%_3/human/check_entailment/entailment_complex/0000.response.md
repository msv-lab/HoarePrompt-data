### Reasoning:

The provided program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets from the day with the lowest current price, taking into account the price increase due to previous purchases. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a priority queue (`pq`) with tuples of prices and their respective days.
   - It also initializes `total_cost` to keep track of the total money spent, `tickets_bought` to count the number of tickets purchased, and `price_increase` to track the cumulative number of tickets bought so far, which affects the price of future tickets.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `tickets_bought` equals `k`, meaning all required tickets have been purchased.
   - In each iteration, the program pops the smallest price from the priority queue, which represents the day with the lowest current price.
   - It then adds the `price_increase` to this price to account for the price increase due to previous purchases.
   - The number of tickets to buy on this day is the minimum of `m` (the maximum allowed tickets per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - The total cost is updated by adding the cost of the tickets bought on this day.
   - The number of tickets bought and the `price_increase` are updated accordingly.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns the `total_cost`, which is the minimum amount of money needed to purchase exactly `k` tickets.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness of the Approach**:
  - The algorithm correctly implements the greedy strategy of always buying tickets from the day with the lowest current price, which is optimal for minimizing the total cost.
  - It correctly handles the price increase mechanism by adjusting the price of future tickets based on the number of tickets bought so far.
  - The use of a priority queue ensures that the smallest price is always considered in constant time, making the algorithm efficient.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where `k` is equal to `nm` (the maximum possible tickets that can be bought), as well as smaller values of `k`.
  - It also handles cases where `m` is very large, as it only buys up to `m` tickets per day if needed.

### Conclusion:

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem and handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
