Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly account for the increasing prices after each purchase. The issue arises from the fact that the prices in the priority queue are not updated after each purchase. This means that once a price is popped from the priority queue, it is not adjusted for subsequent increases, leading to incorrect calculations.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 8
8 6 4 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
64
```

**Explanation of the expected output:**
- Buy 2 tickets on the first day at a cost of 16 (8+8). Prices increase to [10, 8, 6].
- Buy 2 tickets on the second day at a cost of 16 (10+10). Prices increase to [12, 10, 8].
- Buy 2 tickets on the third day at a cost of 16 (12+12). Prices increase to [14, 12, 10].
- Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day at a cost of 16 (14+14).

Total cost: 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 64.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program may output an incorrect value because it does not correctly update the prices in the priority queue after each purchase.

To fix this issue, the program should reinsert the updated price back into the priority queue after each purchase. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        # Reinsert the updated price back into the priority queue
        heapq.heappush(pq, (price + price_increase - price_increase, day))
    return total_cost

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
    print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that the prices are updated and reinserted into the priority queue, leading to the correct calculation of the minimum spending.
