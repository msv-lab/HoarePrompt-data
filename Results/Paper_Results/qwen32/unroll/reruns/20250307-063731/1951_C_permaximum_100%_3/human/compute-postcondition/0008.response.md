Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. `n` is the number of ticket types, `m` is the number of tickets available for each type, `k` is the number of tickets to be bought, and `prices` is a list of `n` integers representing the price of each ticket type. The function returns `total_cost`, which is the sum of the costs of the `k` tickets bought, considering that tickets are bought in increasing order of price.**
