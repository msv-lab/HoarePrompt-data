### Reasoning:

The provided solution aims to find the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets from `n` different days, given that the price per ticket increases with each purchase. Let's analyze the solution step-by-step and validate it against the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of prices `prices`.

2. **Priority Queue Initialization**: The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the prices of tickets along with their respective days. This is done to efficiently fetch the day with the lowest ticket price.

3. **Heapify**: The list of tuples `(price, i)` is heapified to convert it into a priority queue. This ensures that the smallest price is always at the root, allowing for efficient retrieval.

4. **Main Loop**: The program enters a loop that continues until `tickets_bought` equals `k`:
   - **Pop from Heap**: The day with the lowest current ticket price is fetched from the heap.
   - **Price Adjustment**: The price is adjusted by adding the `price_increase` which accumulates with each purchase. This step correctly accounts for the price increase due to previous purchases.
   - **Tickets to Buy**: The number of tickets to buy on the current day is determined as the minimum of `m` (maximum tickets allowed per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - **Cost Calculation**: The total cost is updated by adding the product of the adjusted price and the number of tickets bought.
   - **Update Tickets Bought and Price Increase**: The number of tickets bought is updated, and the `price_increase` is incremented by the number of tickets bought on the current day.

5. **Return Result**: Once the loop exits, the total cost is returned as the result for the current test case.

### Correctness:

The solution correctly implements the required logic to find the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets while adhering to the constraints. The use of a priority queue ensures that the program always buys tickets on the day with the lowest current price, minimizing the total cost. The `price_increase` variable correctly accumulates the price increases due to previous purchases, ensuring that subsequent purchases are priced accordingly.

However, there is a critical issue with the implementation: the priority queue does not account for the updated prices after each purchase. Specifically, once a purchase is made, the prices for subsequent days should be updated in the priority queue to reflect the new prices. The current implementation does not update the priority queue with the new prices, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, after each purchase, the program should update the prices for the remaining days and reinsert these updated prices into the priority queue. This ensures that the next purchase is made from the day with the correct, updated lowest price.

### Corrected Implementation:

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    import heapq
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        # Update the prices for the remaining days and reinsert into the priority queue
        for i in range(day + 1, n):
            new_price = prices[i] + price_increase
            heapq.heappush(pq, (new_price, i))
    return total_cost
```

### Final Evaluation:

Given the critical issue in the original implementation, the original assessment is inaccurate. The program as provided does not correctly update the priority queue with the new prices after each purchase, leading to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
