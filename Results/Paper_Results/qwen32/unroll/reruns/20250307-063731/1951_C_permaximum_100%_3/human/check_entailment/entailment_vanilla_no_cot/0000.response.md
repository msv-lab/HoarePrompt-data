Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly handle the condition that the price per ticket increases for all subsequent days after a purchase is made. The current implementation only increases the price for the day of purchase, which is incorrect based on the problem description.

Here's a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    import heapq
    # Create a priority queue of prices with their indices
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        # Get the smallest price available
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        # Adjust the price by the current price increase
        adjusted_price = price + price_increase
        # Determine the number of tickets to buy today
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        # Add the cost to the total
        total_cost += adjusted_price * tickets_to_buy
        # Update the number of tickets bought
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        # Update the price increase for future days
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        # Push the updated price back into the heap if there are still days left
        if day + 1 < n:
            heapq.heappush(pq, (prices[day + 1] + price_increase, day + 1))
    return total_cost
```

In this corrected version, after purchasing tickets on a given day, the price for the next day (if it exists) is adjusted by the current price increase and pushed back into the priority queue. This ensures that the price increase is correctly applied to all subsequent days, as required by the problem description.
