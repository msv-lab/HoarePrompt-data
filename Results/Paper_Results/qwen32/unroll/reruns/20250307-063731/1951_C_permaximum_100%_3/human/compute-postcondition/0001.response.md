Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) for each price in `prices`.**

In simple terms, the output state is that all the initial conditions for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` remain the same. The only change is that `pq` has been transformed into a heap, meaning it satisfies the heap property where the smallest element is at the root.
