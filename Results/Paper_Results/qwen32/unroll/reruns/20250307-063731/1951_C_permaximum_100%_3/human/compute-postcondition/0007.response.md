To determine the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

Given:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `pq` remain unchanged.
- `total_cost` is the sum of the costs of the `k` tickets bought, considering the increasing price.
- `tickets_bought` will be equal to `k`.
- `price_increase` will be equal to `k`.

The code snippet:
```
return total_cost
```

Since the only variable being returned is `total_cost`, and `total_cost` is described as the sum of the costs of the `k` tickets bought, considering the increasing price, we can infer that `total_cost` is the final value that accumulates the cost of purchasing `k` tickets with each ticket's price potentially increasing.

Output State: **The program returns `total_cost`, which is the sum of the costs of the `k` tickets bought, considering the increasing price.**
