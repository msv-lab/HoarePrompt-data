You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #- `tickets_bought` will be equal to `k`.
    #- `price_increase` will be equal to `k` because it is incremented by the number of tickets bought in each iteration, and the loop runs until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets given the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought per day and the price increases due to previous purchases.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the provided solution:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of prices `prices`.

2. **Priority Queue Initialization**: The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the prices of tickets along with their respective days. This allows the program to efficiently fetch the day with the lowest ticket price.

3. **Heapify**: The list of tuples `(price, i)` is heapified to convert it into a priority queue. This ensures that the smallest price is always at the root, allowing for efficient retrieval.

4. **Main Loop**: The program enters a loop that continues until `tickets_bought` equals `k`:
   - **Pop from Heap**: The day with the lowest current ticket price is fetched from the heap.
   - **Price Adjustment**: The price is adjusted by adding the `price_increase` which accumulates with each purchase.
   - **Tickets to Buy**: The number of tickets to buy on the current day is determined as the minimum of `m` (maximum tickets allowed per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - **Cost Calculation**: The total cost is updated by adding the product of the adjusted price and the number of tickets bought.
   - **Update Tickets Bought and Price Increase**: The number of tickets bought is updated, and the `price_increase` is incremented by the number of tickets bought on the current day.

5. **Return Result**: Once the loop exits, the total cost is returned as the result for the current test case.

### Correctness:

The solution correctly implements the required logic to find the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets while adhering to the constraints. The use of a priority queue ensures that the program always buys tickets on the day with the lowest current price, minimizing the total cost. The `price_increase` variable correctly accumulates the price increases due to previous purchases, ensuring that subsequent purchases are priced accordingly.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
