Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It attempts to perform a binary search on the permutation and swaps elements to ensure that the binary search ends with the correct element. However, the program does not handle the case where two swaps are necessary, and it does not correctly identify when a swap is needed based on the binary search outcome.

Here are the issues:
1. The program performs a binary search but does not correctly handle cases where the permutation needs to be adjusted by two swaps.
2. The program only prints one swap when it is required, and it does not consider the possibility of needing two swaps.
3. The program does not correctly identify the positions that need to be swapped to ensure the binary search ends with the correct element.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
1. Identify the position of `x` in the permutation.
2. Perform up to two swaps to ensure that the binary search will end with `p_l` equal to `x`.
3. Print the number of swaps and the positions of the elements to be swapped.

The current implementation does not account for these requirements, so it is incorrect.
