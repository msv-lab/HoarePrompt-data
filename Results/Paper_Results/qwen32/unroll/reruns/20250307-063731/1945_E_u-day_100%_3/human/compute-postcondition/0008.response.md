To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the provided loop. This loop is a binary search variant that adjusts the `low` and `high` pointers based on the comparison of the middle element `arr[mid]` with `k`. The loop continues until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`.

### Steps to Understand the Loop:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `low` is set to 0.
   - `high` is set to `n`.
   - `st` is an empty set.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `low + 1 < high`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - `mid` is calculated as the integer division of `(low + high) // 2`.
   - `mid` is added to the set `st`.
   - If `arr[mid] > k`, `high` is set to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, `low` is set to `mid`.

### Analysis:
- The loop will iterate until `low` and `high` are consecutive indices.
- The set `st` will contain all the `mid` values that were considered during the binary search.

### Final Output State:
- `low` will be the largest index where `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`.
- `high` will be the smallest index where `arr[high]` is greater than `k` or it will be `n` if no such element exists.
- `st` will contain all the `mid` values considered during the loop.

### Conclusion:
After the loop finishes, `low` and `high` will be consecutive indices, and `st` will contain the `mid` values that were part of the binary search process.

**Output State:** **`low` is the largest index where `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`, `high` is the smallest index where `arr[high]` is greater than `k` or `n` if no such element exists, and `st` contains all the `mid` values considered during the loop.**

In simpler terms, `low` will be the last index where the element is less than or equal to `k`, `high` will be the next index where the element is greater than `k` or `n` if no such element exists, and `st` will have all the midpoints checked during the binary search.
