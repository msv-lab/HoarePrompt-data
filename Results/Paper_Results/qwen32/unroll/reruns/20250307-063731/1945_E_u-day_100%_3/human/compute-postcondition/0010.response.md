The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `0`. The initial state describes several variables (`arr`, `low`, `k`), but these are not used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is solely determined by the argument provided to the `print` function.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print(0)`.
2. The argument to the `print` function is the integer `0`.
3. The initial state provides information about `arr`, `low`, and `k`, but none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
