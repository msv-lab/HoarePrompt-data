The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print(1)` statement. The initial state provides information about the variables `arr`, `low`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `arr`, `low`, and `k`.

Since the `print` statement is `print(1)`, it will output the integer `1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **1**
