Functionality: **The function determines the position of a specified integer `k` in a list `arr` of length `n`. It prints `0` if `k` is found at the position indicated by a binary search, otherwise it prints `1` followed by the index where `k` would be inserted to maintain order and the last occurrence index of `k` in the list, if `k` is present.**
